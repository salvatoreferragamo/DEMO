## Datasets:
PLOS (downloaded from http://www.nactem.ac.uk/readability/) and eLife (downloaded from https://github.com/TGoldsack1/Corpora_for_Lay_Summarisation).
Please put them into the `datasets` folder.

Then, use `data_process.ipynb` to process each dataset and obtain the corresponding data formats needed for each part (DIT/LPS/DCD).

## QA Pairs:
We provide 100 samples for each type of summaries on each dataset. (TODO: the whole doc will be released later...)

Include the `GPT-4-Turbo` generated golden QA pairs and our `QA pairs generator` predicted QA pairs.

## Long context Model:
Please download the model `LongAlpaca-7B` from https://huggingface.co/Yukang/LongAlpaca-7B, and then put it into the `base_model` folder.


## Checkpoint:
We provide a chackpoint of our instruction tuned model with the strategy DIT (https://huggingface.co/hanqinyu/DEMO).

It should be noted that for rapid deployment and reproduction, the checkpoint is based on the 16K context window model `LongAlpaca-7B-16k`, which can achieve comparable performance while requiring less GPU memory.

(TODO: the formal version will be released later...)


## Equipment:
All of our experiments are carried out using 4× NVIDIA A40 48G GPUs.


## Some Results:
We provide part of our models' results and baseline results on test set for a clearer comparison in `model_results`. 

Note that: the reference summaries for the results (we provide here) generated by DEMO_DCD model in eLife is from `model_results/elife/test_filter_elife.jsonl`. Others are top 100 instances of test set on different datasets.
