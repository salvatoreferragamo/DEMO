This paper examines the epigenetic changes that occur in mouse intestinal adenomas following the loss of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), a model for early stages of colon cancer. The authors find that mouse intestinal adenomas have characteristic DNA methylation patterns that are distinct from normal intestinal cells and are established de novo and not inherited from a pre-existing cell population. DNA methylation of promoters is associated with enhanced Polycomb Repressive Complex (PRC2) activity, which is responsible for the hypermethylation of target genes. However, only a minority of genes with hypermethylated promoters are transcriptionally down-regulated, indicating that the correlation between promoter methylation and gene expression is not general. Instead, most genes show an uncoupling of DNA methylation and gene expression. The authors identify a core set of recurring differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that is conserved between mouse and human colon cancers, suggesting that these may be useful as early epigenetic disease markers for the detection of intestinal cancer. They also find that epigenetic silencing of tumour suppressor genes is rare in early adenomas but more frequent in advanced tumors. Overall, the findings suggest that epigenetic changes in tumors arise de novo upon transformation rather than from pre-existing cell populations, and that the epigenetic regulation of gene expression is complex and involves multiple mechanisms beyond simple hypermethylation of promoters.
The paper compares the effects of two strains of Trypanosoma cruzi, one with a relatively mild clinical course (TcI) and one with a severe clinical course (TcII), on human immune cells. The researchers found that infection with the TcII strain led to higher levels of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha and Granzyme A) and a more pro-inflammatory environment, while infection with the TcI strain led to a more balanced immune response with higher levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10) and IL-17. This suggests that the more virulent TcII strain may be associated with a greater risk of pathology. Infection with the TcII strain led to higher expression of co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 on monocytes, while infection with the TcI strain led to higher expression of HLA-DR and TLR-2 on monocytes. The researchers conclude that the virulence of the parasite strain may influence the host immune response early on, potentially shaping the disease outcome later on. The findings suggest that analysis of the immune response to different strains of T. cruzi in acute infection could provide valuable information for patient care and follow-up.
The paper describes the results of genetic disruptions of the DNA polymerase enzyme polν (POLN) in mice. Polν is related to the human enzyme POLQ and is involved in DNA repair. The authors generated three independent mouse models of POLN disruption: 1) deleting exon 2 of the POLN gene, 2) introducing a frameshift mutation in the POLN gene, and 3) using zinc finger nucleases to target the POLN gene. All three mouse models were viable and fertile. The authors then analyzed the mice for phenotypes related to the disruption of POLN. They found that POLN is specifically expressed in testes and is upregulated during testis development, and is enriched in spermatocytes. They also showed that POLN is involved in meiotic recombination, specifically at the A3 hotspot, where it helps bypass DNA lesions. They found that disrupting POLN did not significantly increase sensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, but did show some changes in meiotic recombination frequencies at the A3 hotspot. The study provides insights into the function of POLN and its potential role in testis development and recombination.
The paper discusses the development of a subunit vaccine candidate for dengue virus based on lipidated dengue virus envelope protein domain III (ED III). The authors express the protein in E. coli and purify it without the need for an endotoxin-removing step. They demonstrate that lipidated ED III induces higher ED III-specific antibody responses and neutralizing antibody titers than unlipidated ED III. They show that lipidated ED III has a lower capacity for antibody-dependent enhancement of infection compared to dengue virus, suggesting it may be a safer vaccine candidate. The authors propose that the lipidation of ED III and lack of cross-reactive antibodies may contribute to the lower ADE capacity. They conclude that lipidated ED III has potential as a dengue vaccine candidate and suggest priming with live attenuated dengue vaccines followed by boosting with lipidated ED III may enhance immunity. Overall, the study shows that lipidated ED III has promising immunogenicity and safety properties that could make it a good candidate for clinical use.
The paper studies cell-to-cell variability in protein kinase signaling cascades, focusing on the dose-response behavior of signaling pathways in response to a hormonal stimulus. The authors show that cell-to-cell variability can be actively modulated by tuning parameters, gene expression noise regulation, and additional signaling mechanisms like feedback loops. They find that generic five-step protein kinase cascades exhibit stronger cell-to-cell variability than the yeast pheromone pathway unless certain robustness requirements are fulfilled. They propose that distributed ultrasensitivity, where each cascade level shows mild ultrasensitivity, can establish very steep dose-response curves. Negative feedback can reduce variability, but its functional role depends on the time scale and the number of feedback loops. Correlated fluctuations in multiple signaling proteins are required to effectively reduce variability. The authors conclude that cell-to-cell variability in gradual signaling systems is necessary for robust signaling, while ultrasensitive signaling systems can exhibit switch-like decision-making. However, the absolute signaling activities of some mammalian MAPK cascades are highly variable, while their fold-change in response to stimulus is invariant, suggesting alternative modes of robust signal transmission.
The paper discusses the activation and exhaustion of CD8+ T cells during chronic Leishmania donovani infections in mice. The authors show that CD8+ T cells expand and differentiate into effector cells early in in infection, but this expansion is limited due to antigen load and/dysfunctional DCs. A second wave of activation results in cell death and exhaustion of effector cells. B7-H1 blockade rescues some of the exhausted CD8+ T cells, but does not fully restore cytokine production. Blocking B7-H1 reduces parasite load, suggesting that CD8+ T cell responses are important for controlling L. donovani infections. The authors propose that CD8+ T cell therapy may be beneficial against chronic L. donovani infections, possibly through restoring effector cell function rather than just IFNγ production. The results provide insights into mechanisms of CD8+ T cell exhaustion and suggest that CD8+ T cell therapy may be a promising approach for treating chronic L. donovani infections.
The paper aims to clarify the mechanism of PrP misfolding, a key aspect of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs). Despite much research, little is known about the underlying molecular mechanism. The authors simulate the misfolding of the protein PrP at pH 4.5, which corresponds to the lowest pH observed in endosomes, using MD simulations. They find that protonating H187, a buried residue in the protein, leads to electrostatic repulsion between H187 and R136, a nearby charged residue. This induces conformational changes in the regions connected to H187 and R136, specifically the H2(Cter) and S1,S2 regions. The protonation of H187 disrupts a salt bridge between E196 and R156, and forms a new salt bridge between H187 and R136. The unraveling of H2(Cter) and elongation of S1,S2 in the protonated state are observed. The authors propose that the dual response of H187 and R136, which results in conformational changes in the H2(Cter) and S1,S2 regions, reconciles different proposals regarding the actual PrP region that undergoes deep refolding during misfolding. They suggest that this variability in misfolding pathways may explain the observed resistance of non-mammalian species to TSEs.
This paper presents the results of a randomized controlled trial comparing epilation versus surgery for minor trichiasis (trachomatous trichiasis) in Ethiopia. At baseline, 130 individuals with minor trichiasis were randomized to either immediate surgery or epilation. At four years, 151 participants were re-examined, of whom 57 had undergone surgery and 52 still epilated only. The epilation-only group had more trichias, entropion and lid margin conjunctivalization than the surgery arm and epilation-to-surgery group. Despite being offered free surgery at four years, only 17% of the epilation-only participants accepted it, while 96% were happy epilating. Surgery was found to be more effective for controlling trichiasis than epilation, but there was no difference in visual acuity or corneal opacity between the groups. However, the epilation-only group generally controlled their trichias well by epilation with only a few showing signs of significant progression. The study found that older age, baseline corneal opacity and frequent epilation were associated with deterioration of vision. The high retention rate of epilation forceps suggests that they are valued. The results suggest that good quality epilation in the context of regular follow-up by a service that can provide surgery if needed may be a reasonable alternative to surgery for individuals with minor trichias who either decline surgery or do not have immediate access to it.
The paper describes a study investigating the role of a lectin receptor called mannose receptor (MR) in the in the infection of human monocytes by the dengue virus (DV). The authors show that MR is a novel receptor for DV and that it can mediate both attachment and entry into monocytes. They demonstrate that MR binding to DV is mediated by the lectin activity of the CRD binding to glycans on the DV envelope protein. They show that surface expression of MR on monocytes is upregulated in response to cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-13, which enhances the susceptibility of monocytes to DV infection. They also show that antibodies specific for MR can block DV infection of monocytes, suggesting that MR plays a role in the early stages of infection. The findings suggest that MR may play a role in mediating the attachment and internalization of DV into monocytes, and may contribute to the increased permissiveness of monocytes to DV infection in a Th2-biased environment. The study expands on previous work showing that DC-SIGN is also a receptor for DV attachment. The results provide insights into the mechanisms of DV infection and may be relevant for the development of a dengue vaccine.
The paper proposes a computational model to explore the role of homeostatic mechanisms in regulating neural activity in the brain and behavior. The model consists of a Greenberg-Hastings neural network embodied within a 2D environment, with sensory input from the environment controlling the activity of the model. The authors show that the model with a local homeostatic mechanism that adjusts thresholds at each node to balance excitatory input can escape being stuck in a stationary or motion state, while the model without local homeostasis becomes trapped in one of these states. They argue that the addition of a macroscopic mechanism that balances activity across space, in conjunction with local homeostatic learning, can lead to more stable and flexible behavioral trajectories through the environment. The local homeostatic mechanism focuses on adjusting thresholds at individual nodes, while the macroscopic mechanism balances activity across the entire network. The macroscopic mechanism can compensate for the sensory-motor feedback loop by maintaining a constant number of activated nodes, while the local homeostatic mechanism focuses on adjusting thresholds based on the sensory input. The authors suggest that task negative networks, like the default mode network, may play a role in maintaining stability and normalization in the brain, but do not strictly require being task-positive to perform cognitive functions. The model demonstrates that homeostatic mechanisms can promote richer dynamics and exploration of the environment, but are more important when the environment is complex and the model has to adapt to changing sensory input.
This paper describes a study on how long-distance chromosomal interactions affect gene expression in yeast. The authors constructed a yeast insertion library with thousands of genomic loci and inserted a fluorescent reporter gene flanked by over 1 kb of variable sequences at each locus. They found that a small fraction of loci showed unusual expression patterns that deviated from the norm. Further analysis revealed that profile 2 expression was due to Sir2-mediated silencing, profile 3 was partially due to transcriptional interference, and profile 4 was due to clustering of Met4-targeted genes. The clustering of Met4-targeted genes was found to directly lead to enhanced gene expression, although the detailed mechanism is unclear. Overexpression in profile 4 was found to be specific to the MET3pr promoter and occurred prior to induction. When the MET3pr or the endogenous MET1 gene was translocated to a different locus, it lost the interactions with other profile 4 loci and showed reduced expression. The authors propose that clustering of Met4-targeted genes prior to induction may directly lead to enhanced gene expression by creating a subnuclear compartment with elevated local concentrations of transcription activators, GTFs, and/or pol II. The study provides evidence that some degree of clustering occurs prior to induction and that this clustering is mediated by the MET3 promoter.
The paper investigates the role of the protein Pch2 in ensuring chromosome segregation during meiosis. The authors find that Pch2 is required for the proper organization of chromosomes along the homologous chromosome axes during meiosis, particularly for the formation of chiasmata. Pch2 associates with chromosome axes early during meiosis, before double Holliday junction resolution, and controls the number of Zip3 foci along the chromosomes. Pch2 also limits the occurrence of closely spaced double crossovers. The authors propose a model where Pch2 reorganizes chromosomes into long range control modules, called "one-crossover modules" (OCMs), which allow for the formation of one crossover per bivalent. Each OCM has a central Zip3 focus with associated Hop1 hyperabundance domain that extends to both sides into Hop1-poor regions. Pch2 mediates the installation of OCMs and the associated stress relief and designation of COs. When Pch2 is defective, chromosomes fail to properly organize, resulting in aberrant CO positioning and spore viability defects. The study demonstrates that Pch2 plays a critical role in ensuring chromosome segregation at reduced recombination levels, providing an explanation for how chiasmata are organized along chromosomes. The findings provide insights into how chromosome segregation and crossover formation are coordinated during meiosis and suggest a mechanism for how CO control is linked to chromosome axis status.
This paper investigates the role of a protein called RIN4 in regulating plant immunity against bacterial infection. RIN4 was found to interact with two types of proteins called AHA1 and AHA2, which are involved in regulating the activity of the proton pump H+ATPase. RIN4 was shown to act as a negative regulator of H+ATPase activity, which in turn enables bacteria to gain entry into plant cells by opening stomata. RIN4 overexpression led to increased susceptibility to bacterial infection, while RIN4 knockout led to decreased susceptibility and lower H+ATPase activity. The authors identified six RIN4-associated proteins and found that RIN4 is expressed in guard cells. They propose a model where RIN4 interacts with AHA1 and AHA2 to regulate stomatal apertures in response to pathogen attack. The mechanism of RIN4's regulation of H+ATPase activity is not yet clear but likely involves phosphorylation. The study highlights the importance of the guard cells in regulating stomata apertures during plant immunity and the complexity of the innate immune system.
The paper evaluates the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of routine larviciding against dengue and chikungunya in temperate climates in Europe. The authors used data from entomological surveillance in multiple sites in northern Italy to parameterize a mathematical model of mosquito population dynamics and transmission dynamics. They found that while the risk of autochthonous transmission was low and limited to sporadic transmission in both years, the risk of a chikungunya outbreak was estimated to be up to 30% in 2015, with a non-negligible probability of observing outbreaks larger than 50 cases in most sites. The most effective interventions were those that covered at least the month of July, which corresponds to the peak mosquito abundance. However, the cost-effectiveness of larviciding depends on the actual mosquito abundance in a given year. For small towns with high infestation rates, intense larviciding efforts throughout the season were found to be most beneficial. For medium-sized towns, a moderate larviciding effort covering specific areas with high mosquito abundance was recommended. Larger cities found to be less cost-effective due to high intervention costs covering entire urban areas. Treatment of private breeding sites via citizen involvement was recommended only for small towns with high infestation. The authors also found that routine larviciding could reduce the number of locally transmitted cases and prevent larger outbreaks. The results show that routine larviciding against Ae. albopictus in temperate climates can be an effective way to reduce the epidemiological risk of mosquito-borne diseases, but it is unlikely to completely eliminate the risk. Additional strategies, such as source reduction and genetically modified mosquitoes, may be needed to further reduce transmission. The study provides insights for European municipalities to plan and time routine larviciding interventions aimed at preventing or reducing epidemiological risks.
The paper proposes a sensorimotor system for obstacle avoidance in echolocating bats that does not rely on reconstructing the 3D layout of the environment from the echoes. Instead, it uses the onset of the first echo and the interaural intensity differences to determine the direction and speed of the obstacle. The system focuses on the first millisecond of the echo train, which typically contains echoes from multiple reflectors, and uses the ears to determine the direction and speed of the obstacle. The authors test the system in simulated and real environments and find that it can successfully avoid obstacles even in complex environments with multiple overlapping echoes, without reconstructing the 3D layout of the environment. The system suggests that cyclic ear movements are not strictly necessary for obstacle avoidance, and that ears fixed in an off-axis position can still provide sufficient information to avoid obstacles in both the horizontal and vertical planes. The results extend to frequency-modulated bats, which can also use the onset of the first echo and interaural intensity differences to avoid obstacles. The proposed system provides a robust and computationally efficient approach to obstacle avoidance for echolocating bats, and demonstrates that behavior-based control architectures may be a good fit for the complex and noisy environment of real-world bat echolocation.
The paper presents a mathematical model of an idealized artificial chemistry that can potentially provide insights into the evolution of metabolic pathways in living organisms. The model consists of a set of possible molecules and reactions that can be combined to form metabolic pathways that perform specific tasks. The authors search for the optimal pathways that produce a given output molecule from a single input molecule with minimal number of reactions. They find that the optimal pathways exhibit certain recurring patterns, such as the use of addition chains and autocatalytic cycles, which are found in real metabolic networks. They also find that the distribution of reaction usage across pathways follows a power law, with certain reactions being used more frequently. The model predicts that certain molecules with a specific number of carbons are used more often across different pathways, which may reflect an evolutionary optimization. The authors then compare the optimal pathways in the model to real metabolic networks, finding that the distribution of reaction usage is similar across different networks. They suggest that the model's predictions could be used to guide future research on redesigning metabolic pathways to be more efficient and minimal in terms of enzyme count.
The paper proposes a new method called MAPS (Migration And Population-size Surfaces) to infer spatial and temporal heterogeneity in population sizes and migration rates across a landscape. The method uses pairwise shared coalescence (PSC) segments of different lengths to estimate demographic parameters such as population sizes and migration rates. By analyzing the number of PSC segments of different lengths, the method can reveal changes in population structure over different time periods. The approach builds upon the effective migration surface (EMS) method but can separately estimate population sizes and migration rates. The method uses a coalescent model and a Bayesian inference framework to estimate the parameters. The authors apply MAPS to simulated and real data to show that it can infer population sizes and dispersal rates across different time periods, and geographic regions. The results show that population sizes are generally larger in the past and smaller in the present, which is consistent with previous studies. However, the estimates of population sizes are generally lower than census data, likely due to factors such as non-breeding individuals, population genetic models being an approximation, and cryptic relatedness in the samples. The authors suggest that extending the method to estimate population demography as a function of time would be an interesting avenue for future work.
The paper discusses how insulin resistance affects the ability of liver tissue to heal itself after injury. The study found that mice that lacked the insulin receptor 2 (Irs2) had difficulty repairing their liver tissue after being given a toxic dose of 0.1% DDC. This was due to a failure of the fibrotic stroma to communicate with liver epithelial cells. Specifically, the stroma did not produce enough fibroblast growth factor 7 (Fgf7) and liver fibroblasts did not express Fgfr2-IIIb, which are important factors that help the liver epithelium repair itself. The study showed that Irs2 was required for the stroma to produce Fgf7 and for the epithelial cells to express Fgfr2-IIIb, allowing the liver to heal. The fibrotic stroma and epithelial cells communicated through Fgf7, which was mediated by hepatocyte growth factor receptor 2 (Fgfr2). The study found that loss of Irs2 resulted in a failure to induce Fgfr2-IIIb expression, leading to a decline in epithelial repair. The study suggests that insulin resistance may impair the ability of the liver to heal itself by disrupting the communication between the stroma and epithelium, which could contribute to the progression of liver disease.
The paper investigates the role of the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway in neuronal development, specifically dendrite morphogenesis in neurons. The authors find that the UPR sensor IRE-1 plays a conserved role in dendrite morphogenesis in both C. elegans and mammals. In C. elegans mutants lacking IRE-1 have a secretory block that impairs the targeting of the DMA-1 receptor to the plasma membrane, leading to defective dendrite patterning. They show that reducing insulin/IGF-1 signaling can restore normal dendrite morphology in IRE-1 mutants by by by bypassing the secretory block. They find that the improvement in dendrite morphology is dependent on the UPR pathway and the transcription factor DAF-16. This suggests that promoting ER homeostasis through alternative cues, such as reduced insulin signaling, can bypass the UPR pathway and restore dendrite morphogenesis. The results provide a mechanistic explanation for how neurons grow and function better under reduced insulin signaling and may offer novel approaches for treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.
The paper describes the mapping of the ArcAB regulon, a transcriptional regulation system in E. coli that controls the expression of genes involved in anaerobic fermentation. The ArcAB system is activated when NADH is recycled to NAD+ during fermentation and represses genes involved in aerobic metabolism. The authors used ChIP-seq and ChIP-chip to map the binding sites of the ArcA transcription factor in anaerobic conditions. They identified 176 ArcA binding regions across the genome, including 15 regions that were identified by ChIP-chip. They found that the binding sites contain a conserved 18-bp sequence motif consisting of two direct repeats. They also found that the binding sites exhibit plasticity in terms of the number and spacing of direct repeats. This plasticity likely affects the strength and specificity of ArcA binding and transcriptional regulation. The authors used genome-wide expression profiling to identify operons directly regulated by ArcA, revealing a large direct ArcAB regulon of 1000 genes. They found that ArcA directly represses genes involved in carbon oxidation pathways and indirectly regulates many more operons through other transcription factors. The plasticity of ArcA binding sites likely provides a means for E. coli to maintain redox balance during anaerobic glucose fermentation by selectively repressing genes involved in non-glycolytic carbon oxidation pathways. The results suggest that ArcA functions as a transcriptional repressor that is primarily involved in regulating anaerobic metabolism.
The paper describes a study on the gene usp39 in zebrafish and its role in regulating pituitary development. The researchers found that mutations in the usp39 gene in zebrafish embryos led to an increase in pituitary cell number and cell size, indicating that usp39 plays an important role in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation during pituitary development. They identified two mechanisms by which usp39 regulates pituitary growth: 1) by downregulating the expression of the gene rb1, which is involved in the cell cycle regulator E2F4, and 2) by upregulating E2F4 itself. They showed that usp39 mutations led to defects in rb1 mRNA splicing, resulting in a premature termination codon that leads to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay and loss of rb1 expression. Overexpression of E2F4 in usp39 mutants partially rescued the pituitary phenotype, suggesting that E2F4 contributes to the observed increase in pituitary cell number. The study suggests that usp39 regulates pituitary growth by modulating the balance between cell cycle progression and differentiation through its role in mRNA splicing.
The paper describes a mouse model of cerebellar inflammation following infection with mouse cytomegalovirus in newborn mice. The model uses intraperitoneal inoculation of virus, which is similar to how the virus is typically transmitted to the human fetus in utero. The authors found that the infection resulted in global cerebellar hypoplasia and abnormalities in cerebellar development, including increased thickness of the external granule layer, reduced cerebellar area, and abnormal arborization of Purkinje neurons. They also found that the inflammatory response was the primary cause of these abnormalities, as treatment with dexamethasone, which attenuates inflammation, normalized cerebellar development. They propose that a prolongation of the cell cycle of granule neuron progenitors may be responsible for the cerebellar hypoplasia. The authors suggest that modulating inflammation in the CNS following infection may limit the damage to the developing brain and could potentially provide a new therapeutic approach to manage intrauterine infections.
The paper discusses the potential of using conserved chromosomally encoded autotransporter proteins as vaccine targets for enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) infections. The authors identify two conserved autotransporter proteins, Ag43 and pAT, which are expressed on the surface of ETEC strains and recognized during experimental and natural infections in mice and humans. They test the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of recombinant passenger domains of these proteins in a murine model of ETEC infection and find that immunization with either protein results in significant increases in antibody levels and protection against subsequent colonization. The results suggest that these conserved autotransporter proteins could serve as protective antigens for ETEC vaccines, although the inherent plasticity of E. coli genomes and lack of pathovar-specific antigens poses challenges for vaccine development. The data provide preliminary evidence that other autotransporters not unique to ETEC may also contribute to intestinal colonization and host immune response, which could be useful for vaccine development.
This paper describes a retrospective analysis of 8 cases of Crimean-Congo hemoragic fever (CCHF) diagnosed in Oman between 195 and 2017. The study found that CCHF has been endemic in Oman for at least 2 decades, with sporadic cases reported in the past but a steady increase in recent years, peaking at 20 cases in 2015. The majority of cases were males, with a median age of 3 years. Exposure to animals and fresh tissue was the main risk factor. Most cases presented with fever, hemorrhagic features, myalgia, and thrombocytopenia. There were 3 deaths, resulting in a case fatality rate of 36.4%. The S segment of the CCHF virus was sequenced from 12 patient samples, showing that the isolates were all part of the Asia 1 clade, which has been circulating in the region for at least 20 years. The findings suggest that CCHF is under-recognized in Oman and surrounding countries, and prospective studies are needed to determine the true incidence of mild cases. Oman has improved its notification systems and laboratory support, but active promotion and prevention programs are needed to control infection in animals and ticks.
The paper discusses how cellular robustness against genetic perturbations can be measured experimentally and how it can be used to improve mathematical models of cellular processes. The authors used a technique called "genetic tug-of-war" (gTOW) to measure the copy number limit of different genes overexpression in yeast cells. They found that the copy number limit of certain genes, like CDC14 and ESP1, was lower than predicted by a mathematical model, indicating that the cellular system had robustness against gene overexpression. They identified the mechanism behind this robustness as an imbalance in the amount of the gene and its inhibitor. They found that the inhibitor was in excess, which helped the cell to be robust against gene overexpression. They also identified other regulatory mechanisms that helped mask the fragility caused by this imbalance. They modified a mathematical model to incorporate these mechanisms and tested the predictions experimentally. The study demonstrates how experimental data can be used to improve mathematical models and how cellular robustness can be advantageous for cellular processes.
The paper discusses a previously uncharacterized pathway for the reactivation of the lytic cycle of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), a human herpesvirus that causes cancer and immunodeficiency. KSHV latently infects cells and blocks the phosphorylation of the STAT6 transcription factor on Y641 during latency. However, upon stimulation with cytokines or primary infection, KSHV induces the nuclear localization and cleavage of STAT6, which inhibits the expression of RTA, a transcription factor that regulates the lytic cycle. The study shows that KSHV also induces the degradation of STAT6 through RTA, which is mediated by both the proteasome and lysosomal pathways. The degradation of STAT6 is found to be required for the reactivation of the lytic cycle, and it inhibits the expression of genes involved in extracellular signal transduction, antigen presentation, and cell survival. The study identifies TRIML2 as a key target gene that is ubiquitinated by RTA and upregulated during the lytic cycle, which prolongs cell survival. The results suggest that the degradation of STAT6 is a key event in the reactivation of the KSHV lytic cycle and contributes to the viral life cycle.
The paper presents the results of a prospective cohort study conducted in Dhaka, Bangladesh to determine the seroprevalence and seroconversion of dengue fever virus in the population. The study found that a large proportion of the population was newly exposed to dengue virus during the study period, with high seroprevalence ranging from 80% to 93% and significant seroconversion (57%), indicating ongoing transmission. The authors identified household level factors such as the presence of indoor potted plants and types of mosquito control measures as being associated with seroprevalence. They found that attendance in public gatherings and the use of personal mosquito control measures were associated with seroconversion. The study suggests that household level interventions such as removing indoor potted plants and increasing bed net use could reduce exposure to dengue infections in the city. However, the lack of active surveillance and public health measures to prevent spread of dengue virus poses a major public health challenge. The study highlights the need for a dengue surveillance system to estimate the impact of dengue disease burden in Dhaka and other urban areas. The results suggest that co-transmission of other arboviruses like chikungunya and zika virus and the spread of Aedes mosquitoes due to increasing international mobility pose challenges for public health.
The paper discusses the molecular mechanisms underlying the spore formation in Clostridium difficile. The authors find that excision of a skin element called skinCd is required for the activation of the σK gene, which is a mother cell-specific gene involved in spore morphogenesis. They identify two genes, CD1231 and CD1234, that are involved in the excision of skinCd. CD1231 is required for excision, but CD1234 is also required. The authors show that CD134 acts as a recombination direction factor that stimulates the formation of the synapse complex between attL and attR, while CD131 occasionally performs excision without CD134. The excision of skinCd is essential for proper σK activity and sporulation. The authors propose that CD134 may occasionally perform excision of skinCd in vegetative cells and bacteria in the absence of CD131, leading to the possibility that σK is recruited to additional functions. The alterations in the spore surface layers caused by premature σK activity in the skinCd-less strain may affect spore persistence and infectivity. The results suggest that the sporulation program in C. difficile is more permissive to changes in the proper timing of morphogenetic events compared to B. subtilis.
The paper describes a systematic analysis of the predictive power of metagenomic shotgun sequencing data for disease classification. The authors analyzed 242 human shotgun metagenomic samples from 8 studies of 6 diseases using cross-validation, cross-study validation and cross-disease validation. They found that different classification methods (e.g. SVM, RF) achieved varying levels of accuracy depending on the disease, with some diseases (e.g. cirrhosis) showing higher accuracy. They also found that including healthy samples from independent cohorts improved the generalization of the models to new cohorts. They identified biomarkers that were relevant for the "healthy" versus "diseased" microbiome. The authors stress that using cross-study validation instead of cross-validation is necessary to understand the generalization capabilities of the models, as cross-validation can overestimate performance. They also emphasize that including healthy samples from independent cohorts in training sets can improve transferability of the models. They propose the use of strain-specific markers as an alternative to species-level abundances for disease classification. The study provides a framework for evaluating and comparing different machine learning methods for metagenomic prediction tasks, as well as identifying biomarkers that are general indicators of a non-healthy microbiome.
This paper investigates the relationship between the rate of HIV-1 evolution and disease progression in subjects carrying the HLA-B*501 allele. The study finds that subjects with higher CD4+ T cell counts in early infection have slower HIV-1 evolutionary rates, which may be linked to better control of viral replication. Subjects with lower CD4+ T cell counts have faster HIV-1 evolutionary rates, which may indicate a higher rate of adaptation and an increased risk of disease progression. The study finds that the difference in evolutionary rates between high-risk progressors (HRPs) and low-risk progressors (LRPs) is due to differences in CD4+ T cell counts, not differences in T cell activation or initial infection with fitter viral variants. The study provides a potential mechanism for the observed differences in disease progression between the two groups, where high CD4+ T cell counts in early infection result in slower HIV-1 evolution and a lower risk of disease progression. The findings provide a novel evolutionary marker for disease progression and suggest that immune control during early infection may play an important role in controlling viral replication and disease progression.
This paper describes the discovery of a potential target for the drug class of choline analogs used to treat African trypanosomiasis. The authors used an RNA interference library to identify genes that confer resistance to the drugs. They found that expression of a gene encoding a mitochondrial carrier protein, TbMCP14, was downregulated in parasites that were resistant to the drugs. Overexpression of TbMCP14 in procyclic forms resulted in increased sensitivity to the drugs, while depletion of TbMCP14 in bloodstream forms resulted in increased resistance. The authors propose that TbMCP14 is involved in proline metabolism for energy production in mitochondria, possibly by promoting proline transport through the mitochondrial inner membrane. The results suggest that TbMCP14 is a potential target for the drugs, although the exact mechanism of action is not yet fully understood. The study demonstrates that the mitochondrial carrier family is involved in drug action and provides a new avenue for targeting these parasites.
The paper discusses the results of an investigation into the evolution of the bombesin receptor (BRS3) family of G protein-coupled receptors in placental mammals. BRS3 was previously considered an orphan receptor since it was not known to have a cognate ligand. However, the study shows that BRS3 in placental mammals has undergone positive selection and lost its original ligand binding activity. Instead, it constitutively activates Gq and G1 signaling pathways, indicating that it has become a genuinely orphan receptor in placental mammals. The study used a combination of phylogenetic analysis, structural modeling, binding assays, and functional assays to demonstrate that BRS3 in placental mammals has a different structure and function compared to nonplacental BRS3. The key residues for its constitutive activity are found in its N-terminal domain, which underwent positive selection in placental mammals. The results suggest that BRS3 in placental mammals may function in a ligand-independent manner and that endogenous ligands for BRS3 do not exist, making it a genuinely orphan receptor. The study provides new insights into the evolution of orphan receptors and the challenges of identifying their endogenous ligands.
This paper proposes a novel framework called SPINDLE for automatic sleep scoring of animal EEG/EMG recordings. The framework combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and hidden Markov models (HMMs) in an end-to-end fashion to learn robust features and model vigilance state dynamics. The CNNs operate on the time-frequency transformed EEG/EMG signals to extract discriminative features that are translation invariant across animals and experimental settings. The HMMs describe the transitions between vigilance states and suppress impossible transitions. The framework is trained on two wildtype mice and tested on 12 mice and 8 rats from 4 different animal cohorts, achieving high accuracy across species and labs. The authors show that SPINDLE is comparable to human experts in terms of predictive performance, artifact detection and classification, and it can generalize to different experimental settings. The framework is accessible through a web service and has the ability to adapt an artifact threshold for artifact rejection. The key design decisions include using an out-of-the-box CNN architecture, not including memory models like RNNs, and using separate CNNs for artifacts and vigilance states.
The paper describes how the parasite Toxoplasma gondii, which causes toxoplasmosis in humans and animals, can import isoprenoids from its host cells to supplement its own synthesis, but still relies on this host-derived isoprenoids for growth and virulence. The parasite has a bifunctional enzyme that can catalyze multiple isoprenoid synthesis reactions. The authors show that inhibition of the host mevalonate pathway, which generates the isoprenoid precursors, enhances the effect of inhibiting the parasite's isoprenoid pathway, and propose a double-hit strategy combining host and parasite pathway inhibitors. They demonstrate this by showing that the parasite is more sensitive to inhibitors of the host mevalonate pathway when it cannot produce its own isoprenoids. They also show that inhibition of the parasite's isoprenoid pathway, while less effective when the host isoprenoids are available, can still provide protection against infection. The authors propose that targeting both the parasite and host pathways could provide a higher rate of success in treating Toxoplasma infections.
This paper investigates the evolutionary history of the three fungal species that cause the Sigatoka disease complex of bananas and plantains, which reduces banana yields by more than 40%. The three species, Pseudocerospora fiji, Pseudocerosae, and Pseudocercops, have different levels of virulence and have emerged over the past century. The paper compares their genomes to identify changes that may have contributed to their different levels of virulence. The analysis shows that the genomes of the three species have evolved differently, with Pseudocerosae and Pseudocercops having larger genome sizes and more gene families related to metabolism, which may contribute to their increased virulence. The paper identifies a number of genes and proteins that are unique to each species and are likely virulence associated, as well as metabolic streamlining that may have evolved in Pseudocercps and Pseudocercps to better exploit banana nutrients. The study suggests that evolution of virulence in these fungi is driven by both species-specific adaptations and molecular pathways. The findings provide insights into the genomic changes that may underlie the emergence and evolution of new plant diseases and can inform strategies to manage these diseases.
This paper investigated the global gene expression patterns in whole blood from patients with visceral leishmaniasis (VL), patients undergoing treatment and remission of the disease, and healthy individuals, in order to understand the molecular mechanisms that underlie the different clinical outcomes. The study found that infections with L. infantum induce distinct transcriptional signatures in whole blood, which can segregate patients based on their clinical status. The analysis identified pathways and modules related to T cell activation and antigen presentation, which were up-regulated in VL patients, while pathways related to innate immunity were down-regulated. The study suggests that the type I interferon response is activated in both VL patients and asymptomatic individuals, but showed different regulation depending on the clinical status. The results indicate that treatment may restore balance to adaptive responses, as well as promote recovery of circulating neutrophils and monocytes. The findings highlight the importance of studying blood transcriptional profiles in distinct states of infection with L. infantum, as well as longitudinal studies to identify new biomarkers and predictive power. The study identifies a protective role for the Notch signaling pathway and the potential for exhausted T cell phenotype to contribute to the pathogenesis of VL. The results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease and could guide the development of interventions.
The paper presents a model that attempts to explain how seemingly complex social behaviors in the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum can be generated by a simple developmental mechanism based on the production and response to social signals. The authors propose that variation in clonal and chimeric social behavior in D. discoideum is modulated by a simple mechanism based on the production and response to social signals. They test this hypothesis by examining social signaling in a collection of natural genetic isolates and in a genotype with a disrupted social behavior gene. They find that mutations in a single gene, lsrA, can generate changes in both clonal and chimeric behavior by altering the production and response to social signals. The model predicts that apparent partner-specific behaviors can occur through changes in StIF production and response, rather than through partner recognition. The model accurately predicts observed patterns of social behavior across genotypes, demonstrating that social strategies can be manifested as a set of knowable parameters related to StIF production and response. The authors suggest that complex social behaviors can be generated by a simple system, but the underlying pathways regulating StIF production and response may be more complex. The results imply that understanding the basic rules governing interactions can help us better understand the evolution and maintenance of social behavior.
The paper identifies a new RNA motif called the secretion enhancing cisitizing element (SECReTE) that is present in secretory mRNAs and enhances their localization to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The SECReTE motif is composed of 10 or more consecutive pyrimidine residues in the 5' or 3' untranslated region of the mRNA. The authors found that this motif is more prevalent in mRNAs encoding secreted proteins than membrane proteins, and that the second and third positions of the codon are more highly enriched with the pyrimidine residues. They also found that SECReTE presence in mRNAs is enriched on ER-bound ribosomes and polysomes, but not on mitochondrial ribosomes. SECReTE mutations in secretory proteins SUC2, HSP150 and CCW12 resulted in changes in their secretion, growth rate, and secretion rate, suggesting that it plays a role in enhancing protein synthesis and secretion. The authors propose that SECReTE may act as a cis-regulatory element that enhances mRNA localization to the ER, thereby enhancing translation efficiency and protein synthesis. They identified several RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that bind mRNAs with high levels of SECReTE motifs, and found that Whi3 and Khd1 are potential binding partners. Further experiments are needed to determine the exact mechanism by which SECReTE enhances mRNA localization and protein synthesis. The discovery of SECReTE may provide a new tool for improving the secretion of recombinant proteins.
The paper examines the population genetics of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in California, which are a vector for dengue fever and chikungunya. The study aims to determine if the mosquitoes in California originated from one or multiple introductions, characterize their genetic structure, and determine if they are overwintering. The researchers find that the populations in Northern and Southern California are genetically distinct, and that at least two introductions of Aedes aegypti into California are responsible for the current populations. They find that the Northern California populations likely originated from an invasion from the South Central region of the US, while the Southern California populations likely came from the Southwest region. The Southern California populations are less genetically diverse, suggesting bottlenecks or vector control measures have reduced their population size. The study also finds that mosquitoes in California are often genetically distinct even when located close to each other, indicating limited gene flow. The findings suggest that effective vector control in California may be more challenging due to the possibility of multiple introductions of Aedes aegypti and genetic distinctness among populations.
The paper describes a genetic model of the lipid metabolism of Rhodococcus, a chemoheterotrophic bacterium that can ferment various organic compounds into fatty acids and lipids. The model was built using a combination of genome sequencing, comparative genomics, and biochemical characterization of purified enzymes. The authors identified that Rhodoccus has a unique lipid metabolism pathway that involves a type 1a fatty acid synthase that incorporates propionyl-CoA as a substrate to produce straight-chain odd-carbon fatty acids, as well as a multifunctional fatty acid synthase and a related MAS-family type 1b synthase that generates branched fatty acids. The authors found that Rhodoccus has an expanded gene family of enzymes involved in the TAG cycle, including DGATs, acetyl-CoA ligases, enoyl-CoA hydratases, and FAMEs. They also found that the TAG cycle genes were expanded in Rhodoccus, including 26 genes for the first step in TAG biosynthesis, indicating that Rhodoccus can catabolize and extract energy from a diverse range of carboxylic acids. The model provides a template for refinement with integration of data from genetics, biochemistry, metabolomics and transcriptomics. The results show that Rhodoccus has a diverse lipid metabolism that could be used to convert agricultural, natural resource and industrial waste streams into fuels.
The paper investigates how prokaryotic DNA sequences can be analyzed by examining the variance in oligonucleotide frequencies instead of simply looking at the mean frequencies. The authors find that tetranucleotide frequencies contain considerable genomic information potential and are used in all statistical tests. They show that tetranucleotide variance within genomes is related to genomic GC content, with more random genomes having less variance in tetranucleotide usage. They find that AT rich genomes have more varied tetranucleotide frequencies in non-coding regions than GC rich genomes, while the opposite is true for coding regions. They also find that coding regions are generally more biased than non-coding regions, and that the variance in tetranucleotide usage is negatively correlated with mean genomic GC content. The results suggest that genomes with more GC content tend to have more homogeneous non-coding regions while genomes with more AT richness have more varied non-coding regions. The authors conclude that considering oligonucleotide variance can reveal properties of prokaryotic genomes beyond what is detectable by looking at mean frequencies.
The paper investigates the effects of targeted gene disruption in mice using gene trap and deletion vectors. The authors find that targeted genes are often accompanied by local transcriptional effects on nearby genes, which they hypothesize are due to the presence of the vector insertion and/deletion. They evaluate this local effect using RNA-seq and find that targets with a LacZ selection cassette have a higher frequency of up- or down-regulated genes within 50 kb of the targeted gene compared to the expected frequency based on a genome-wide survey. They also find that genes flanking the targeted gene are more likely to be down-regulated than up-regulated, and that the spatial organization of these effects is consistent with the direction of the targeting event. They conclude that the local effects are likely due to the presence of the vector insertion/deletion and not just the loss of the targeted gene product. The study suggests that local effects may be a useful tool for evaluating the impact of targeted gene disruption.
This paper describes the identification of a new mechanism for regulating gene expression in the gonads of vertebrates. The authors found that a conserved 1-base motif in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the gene dmrt1bY, called the D3U-box, is targeted by two RNA-binding proteins, Ol-cug-bp and Ol-bsf, which regulate the stability of drt1bY mRNA. Ol-cug-bp and Ol-bsf have opposing functions, with Ol-cug-bp promoting degradation and Ol-bsf stabilization. The authors found that the D3U-box motif is targeted by both proteins in a differential manner, depending on its location within the UTR. They showed that Ol-bsf specifically targets the D3U-box in germ cells, while Ol-cug-bp targets it in somatic cells. The authors also found that the D3U-box motif is a target of both Ol-bsf and Ol-cug-bps in a conserved manner across multiple species, indicating an evolutionary conserved mechanism. Overexpression of Ol-bsf leads to increased stability of drt1bY mRNA, while loss of Ol-bsf leads to reduced stability. The authors showed that the D3U-box also regulates the expression of other genes involved in germ cell development, including tra2, sox10, misr2, dead end, and vasa. Their findings reveal a new mechanism for regulating gene expression in the gonads of vertebrates and provide insights into the regulation of drt1bY expression during gonad development and maintenance.
The paper investigates the relationship between eggshell melanization and egg resistance to desiccation in mosquitoes of different genera. The researchers found that eggshell melanization is directly associated with egg viability outside the water after serosal cuticle formation. They tested this in three mosquito species, Aedes aegypti, Anopheles aquasalis and Culex quinquefasciatus. They found that Aedes aegypti eggs, which have high levels of eggshell melanization, have high resistance to desiccation, while Anopheles species have intermediate levels and Culex quinquefasciatus eggs have low levels. The researchers conclude that eggshell melanization is an important factor in determining egg resistance to desiccation, but other factors such as egg size, surface area, weight and chitin content also play a role. The results suggest that eggshell melanization is an important trait for mosquito species to survive in hostile environments and spread to new habitats. The findings could inform studies on mosquito ecology and management.
The paper investigated the effect of Schistosoma mansoni infection on susceptibility to HIV infection in rhesus macaques. The researchers found that Schistosoma mansoni infection significantly increases the susceptibility of hosts to mucosal HIV transmission. The study showed that Schistosoma infection reduced the minimal infectious dose of HIV needed to establish systemic infection by 6-fold compared to uninfected controls, resulting in higher peak vRNA loads and faster loss of CD4+ T cells. The results suggest that Schistosoma infection increases host susceptibility to HIV infection and supports the hypothesis that helminth infections may be a risk factor for increased susceptibility to de novo HIV infection. The study highlights the potential benefits of controlling helminth infections as a public health intervention to reduce the spread of HIV, especially in areas where both parasites and HIV are endemic.
This paper proposes a computational model to explain how somite reproducibility is achieved in embryonic development despite cell-to-cell variations in gene expression caused by stochastic noise. The model focuses on the role of the segmentation clock in regulating the ERK activity bifurcation diagram, which reduces the noise effect and enhances developmental reproducibility. The model shows that the clock provides temporal information on somite formation, allowing for reproducible constant-sized somites. In contrast, clock removal impedes somite individualization, leading to irregularly sized somites. The model predicts that stepwise ERK activity shifts still occur in clock-deficient embryos, but with highly variable somite sizes. The model is validated through experiments using a FRET-based biosensor of ERK activity in zebrafish embryos. The findings provide insights into the mechanisms underlying reproducibility in developmental events in multicellular organisms and highlight the importance of temporal regulation in achieving reproducibility.
The paper investigates how oligomerization affects the dynamics of protein components, specifically enzymes in the AAK family. It compares the intrinsic dynamics of monomeric and dimeric/hexameric components and finds that oligomerization tends to preserve or constrain the dynamics of the monomeric components. This is especially seen in the hexameric assembly of TmNAK, where the AB dimer is unable to sample certain modes accessible to the isolated monomer. The authors argue that the topology of the interfacial contacts and overall geometry of the oligomer play a key role in defining the collective motions that are exploited by the oligomers, which are used for substrate binding and allosteric regulation. They also find that the design of the interface and oligomerization geometry seems to be crucial in defining the functional mechanisms of oligomers, as different enzymes selectively exploit different dynamic features of their monomeric/dimeric components. The study shows that the low-frequency modes of motion, which are robustly determined by the overall structure, are relevant to the functional mechanisms of the oligomers and can be used to identify key residues involved in inter-subunit communication. The results highlight the importance of understanding the dynamics of protein components at the monomeric and oligomeric levels for understanding the structure-function code of oligomeric proteins.
The paper discusses how the rabies virus, which is transmitted by dogs, has been spreading in North Africa for over a century. To understand the spatial dynamics of this spread, the authors performed a phylogenetic analysis of dog rabies virus sequences from Algeria, Morocco, and Spain. They found that while the virus shows country-specific clusters, there is still significant spatial structure within each country. This suggests that human-mediated diffusion is the main factor in spreading the virus, rather than local movement of infected dogs. The authors analyzed different predictors, including geographical distance, human population size, road distance, accessibility, and population conductivity, to determine which best explained the observed spatial dynamics. They found that road distances were the best predictor, indicating that human-mediated diffusion is the main driver of rabies spread in North Africa. They also showed that the high rates of viral gene flow observed in their samples, estimated at 26-43 km/yr, are significantly higher than what would be expected for spread through dog movement alone. This suggests that human activities play a major role in maintaining the rabies epidemic in North Africa. The study highlights the importance of understanding how humans affect the spread of zoonotic diseases like rabies, and demonstrates the power of phylogeographic approaches in identifying the factors responsible for their transmission.
The paper estimates the risk of dengue fever transmission during the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil based on historical dengue surveillance data from 2010 to 2013. The authors use two methods: a percentile rank (PR) method and an empirical Bayes (EB) model to predict dengue incidence rates during the World Cup weeks for game and basecamp cities. They find that the risk is low, except for Fortaleza, where dengue transmission has been high in previous years. They estimate that between 26 and 53 symptomatic dengue cases would occur among 60,000 tourists visiting Brazil during the World Cup, with the highest number among German, Mexican, and Colombian tourists. The estimates are based on assuming that all tourists will visit during round one and stay for two weeks. The authors note that actual numbers could be higher if tourists stay longer and that the exact number of visitors is currently unknown. The paper highlights the importance of quantitative risk estimates for disease transmission during mass gatherings and the need for better preparedness and response.
This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the epigenetic and transcriptomic landscapes during brown adipocyte differentiation from multipotent mesenchymal stem cells to mature brown adipocytes. The authors used C3H10T1 cells as a model system to differentiate brown adipocytes from multipotent stem cells. They identified four novel regulators of brown adipocyte differentiation through a combination of gene expression analysis, epigenomic profiling and functional validation: the kinase PIM1, the transcription factor SIX1, the transcription factor RREB1 and the transcription factor SOX13. These factors were shown to promote brown adipocyte differentiation and function through different mechanisms. The paper also identified putative super-enhancers that are associated with brown adipocyte differentiation and lineage-specific enhancers that are associated with key regulators of brown adipocyte differentiation. The study provides a valuable resource for identifying additional regulators of brown adipocyte differentiation and understanding the epigenetic regulation of brown adipocyte lineage commitment.
The paper discusses the inconsistent results found among 6 reference centers in Brazil for the serological diagnosis of Paracocysicomycosis (PCM) using standard serological techniques. Despite significant contributions to the field, the centers showed high rates of major discordances, with some discordances potentially leading to incorrect treatment decisions. The reasons for the discordances were found to be due to differences in antigen preparation techniques (DID vs. CIE) and the type of antigen used (single vs. pool of isolates). The study suggests that standardization of these techniques and development of new standardized serological tests for PCM and other endemic mycoses in South America is needed to improve diagnosis.
The paper investigated the impact of Cutaneous Larva Migrans (CLM), a parasitic skin disease caused by hookworm larvae, on the quality of life of patients in a resource-poor urban community in the Amazonas State of Brazil. The study found that 94.5% of patients with CLM reported a reduction in their skin-associated life quality with a median mDLQI score of 5, indicating a moderate to severe impairment. The degree of impairment was positively correlated with the severity of the infection, number of affected body areas, and presence of lesions on visible parts of the body. Pruritus, sleep disturbance, feeling of shame and need to dress differently were the most common restrictions. The study suggests that the impairment is caused by the parasitic disease itself and not just the low socio-economic conditions of the community, as already two weeks after treatment with ivermectin, the degree of impairment decreased significantly. The findings suggest that treatment with ivermectin can not only eliminate the parasitic pathology but also alleviate the psycho-social consequences and prevent secondary morbidity.
The paper discusses the estimation of ecological parameters of the S-9 methyl population of Lu. longipalpis, a species of sand fly involved in the transmission of visceral leishmaniasis in Brazil. The study found that the population had a daily survival rate of around 0.79 for males and 0.8 for females, which is higher than previously reported for other neotropical sand fly species. The survival rate was estimated through recapture of specimens marked and released under field conditions. The study also found that the population had low dispersal, with most specimens recaptured within 10 meters of the release point, and high male recapture rates. The population size was estimated using the Lincoln index and showed seasonal variation. The estimated population size, daily survival rate and gonotrophic cycle duration provide important information for the understanding of visceral leishmaniasis transmission dynamics and the effectiveness of control measures aimed at reducing the vector density and host biting rate. The findings suggest that environmental management in the peridomiciliary environment could have an impact on the vector population and therefore reduce transmission. The study provides important information on the vectorial capacity of this cryptic species, which is critical for the development of models to evaluate prevention and control measures and increase knowledge of visceral leishmanias dynamics.
The paper discusses how enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EPEC and EHEC, respectively) infections activate NF-κB signaling pathways in epithelial cells. The authors find that EPECs have a type three secretion system (TTSS) that translocates effector proteins into host cells, which activate NF-κB signaling. They identify the Tir protein as the key effector that mediates NF-κB activation. However, they find that NleB, NleC, and NleE proteins, which inhibit NF-κB signaling, are not required for TTSS-mediated NF-κB activation. Instead, they propose that the host cells detect an active TTSS apparatus, possibly through a sensor that is not exposed on the surface of the bacteria. They find that the TTSS apparatus is sufficient to induce NF-κB activation, but not a specific effector protein. They propose that the host cells detects a cue specific to the TTSS pore, possibly a structural element of the EspB protein. They also find that TLRs are not involved in TTSS-mediated NF-κB activation, and that the TTSS-sensing mechanism likely converges with other signaling pathways that lead to NF-κB activation. The study suggests that the TTSS-mediated pathway may provide a mechanism for the bacteria to establish a long-term sub-clinical carrier state in humans.
This paper describes a study using molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the binding of the RNA-binding protein Rbfox to the RNA target pre-miR20b. The authors used MD simulations to predict the structure of the Rbfox•pre-miR20b complex, which is the engineered protein-RNA complex with mutations that improve the affinity and selectivity for the target pre-miR20b. The simulations showed that the protein-RNA interface is stabilized by hydrogen bonds and stacking interactions, with the β2β3 loop being less flexible. The mutations introduced in the protein, such as replacing the amino acids at position 151, also improved the binding affinity and selectivity. The simulations provided a detailed picture of the interactions at the protein-RNA interface and suggested a new mutation, S151T, which would further improve the affinity and selectivity. The simulations were validated through comparison with available NMR data and showed good agreement. The results suggest that MD simulations can be a useful tool for engineering RNA-binding proteins to improve their specificity and affinity.
The paper describes the expression, purification, and biochemical characterization of Schistosoma mansoni serine protease 2 (SmSP2). SmSP2 is a multi-domain enzyme found exclusively in the platyhelminths, a group of parasitic flatworms. The enzyme is expressed most abundantly in the blood-dwelling stages of Schistosoma mansoni and is involved in various physiological processes, including proteolysis of host proteins. The authors show that SmSP2 is a trypsin-like protease that cleaves peptides at the carboxy-terminal arginine or lysine residue, with a preference for basic residues at the P1 position. It is inhibited by trypsin-like protease inhibitors. They demonstrate that SmSP2 processes several physiologically relevant host proteins, including fibronectin, plasminogen, tissue plasminogen activator, and bradykinin. The enzyme is localized in the tegument of adult Schistosoma mansoni, and its activity is involved in the release of bradykinin from high molecular weight kininogen and the activation of tissue plasminogen. The authors propose that SmSP2 may play a role in promoting fibrinolysis by activating plasminogen, processing tissue plasminogen activator, producing bradykinin, and degrading fibronectin.
The paper discusses the role of γ T cells in protecting mice from murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection. The authors found that γ T cells are as effective as α T cells in controlling MCMV infection and protecting mice from death. They showed that γ T cells are sufficient to control viral load and prevent organ damage in mice lacking α T cells, and that the protective effect is not dependent on the presence of NK cells. They found that γ T cells expand in the lungs and liver after MCMV infection and persist as memory cells. They propose that γ T cells may exert an indirect antiviral effect by promoting the accumulation of NK cells. The results suggest that γ T cells could be useful for inducing or enhancing an anti-MCV immune response in clinical settings where α T cells are compromised, such as in immunosuppressed transplant recipients. The study provides new perspectives for manipulating γ T cells as a potential therapeutic approach to combat MCMV-mediated disease.
This paper investigated the role of a Plasmodium cysteine protease inhibitor (ICP) in the life cycle of the parasite Plasmodium berghei. ICPs were found to be essential for sporozoite invasion of salivary glands and hepatocytes in mosquitoes and mammalian hosts. ICPs were shown to regulate gliding motility and cysteine protease activity during liver stage development. PbICP was found to be essential for hepatocyte invasion and only a few PbICP-deficient sporozoites were able to invade hepatocytes. The results suggest that PbICP is a molecular regulator of cysteine protease activity during different life stages of the parasite. The study provides evidence that ICPs are the molecular regulators of cysteine protease activity during invasion and intracellular development. The findings may allow new approaches to control Plasmodium invasion and intracellular development.
The paper investigates the role of the divergent acidic patch on the histone variant H2A.Z in regulating chromatin dynamics and gene expression during embryonic stem cell differentiation. H2A.Z is an essential but poorly understood histone variant that has specialized functions during development. The authors generated a mutant form of H2A.Z with mutations in the acidic patch and analyzed its effects on gene expression, chromatin dynamics, and interactions with other proteins. They found that the mutant H2A.ZAP3 is less associated with chromatin and has lower levels at promoters and bivalent genes compared to wild-type H2A.Z. This leads to changes in gene expression, particularly at bivalent genes that are sensitive to H2A.Z regulation. The authors propose that the divergent acidic patch is necessary for maintaining the poised state of bivalent genes and that disruption of this region results in increased chromatin dynamics and altered expression. The dynamic association of H2A.ZAP3 with chromatin is also linked to the +1 nucleosome, which is important for gene activation. The study provides new insights into the role of the acidic patch in regulating chromatin dynamics and gene expression during development.
The paper describes a new method for analyzing cell lineage dynamics in the intestinal epithelium of mice using somatic mutations. The method is based on the notion that each cell in the intestinal epithelium accumulates unique genomic signatures through cell divisions, which can be used to reconstruct the cell lineage tree. The authors first validated their method by showing that individual cells from the same crypt are clustered on the lineage tree, indicating monoclonal conversion, and that whole crypts are deeper than their most recent common stem cell (MRSC). They then showed that the depth of crypts increases linearly with mouse age, indicating that crypt stem cells accumulate somatic mutations. They also showed that different crypts are clustered separately on the lineage tree, indicating that the colon is composed of a few distinct progenitors. They also showed that bone marrow cells do not significantly renew the intestinal epithelium, indicating that the lineage between the colon and bone marrow is not restored. They applied their method to study the dynamics of crypt stem cells in the intestine and found that colon crypts are enriched separately from other cell types, indicating that only a few distinct progenitors generate the colon. Overall, the authors demonstrated that their method can be used to study stem cell dynamics in crypts and lineages where specific markers are not available, providing new insights into the origins of cell types and tissues.
The paper describes a study using BLT mice to evaluate the impact of antiretroviral therapy (ART) on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) persistence in different organs throughout the body. The researchers found that while ART alone could reduce HIV viremia in the peripheral blood, it did not completely eliminate HIV producing cells in other organs like the thymus, spleen, liver, and lungs. They also found that adding an immunotoxin called 3B3-PE38 that targets HIV gp120 to the ART regimen could significantly reduce the number of HIV producing cells throughout the body, including in the bone marrow. This suggests that targeted killing of HIV infected cells during the period of low viremia (plateau) after ART may be important for achieving HIV eradication. The study provides a framework for evaluating the efficacy of cytotoxic therapies that target HIV producing cells during ART, which could be a critical component of an effective HIV eradication strategy. The authors note that alternative immunotoxins with different effector domains and targeting moieties are available, and may be needed to completely eliminate HIV producing cells due to the immunogenicity of individual immunotoxins.
The paper discusses the sensitivity and specificity of two commercial dengue fever NS1 detection assays, the Platelia ELISA and NS1-LFT, in diagnosing acute dengue infections in Vietnamese patients. The study found that the Platelia ELISA was more sensitive than the NS1-LFT, particularly in samples collected within 3 days of illness onset, while the NS1-LFT was less sensitive in samples from patients with secondary dengue infections. The authors suggest that the lower sensitivity of the NS1-LFT in secondary dengue may be due to the presence of anti-DENV antibodies sequestered in immune complexes that target epitopes not accessible by the assay. They conclude that while the NS1-LFT is easy to use and fast, its lower sensitivity in secondary dengue patients may limit its usefulness in clinical settings. However, the study highlights the importance of considering the limitations of existing NS1 tests and that a negative result does not exclude the possibility of dengue. The findings suggest that patients with higher viraemia levels are more likely to test positive for NS1 antigen, which may indicate a higher risk of developing severe complications during illness. The study provides insights into the clinical implications of using NS1 assays for dengue diagnosis and has implications for the development of anti-viral drugs.
This paper investigates why attendance at static dog vaccination points in sub-Saharan Africa is suboptimal. The authors conducted a city-wide vaccination campaign in Blantyre, Malawi and found that distance from the nearest static point was an important determinant of attendance. For every kilometer closer to the nearest static point, the odds of a dog being taken to the point for vaccination were 3.3 times higher. The distance was also one of the most common reasons given by owners for not attending static points. The study also found that socio-economic status influenced attendance, with dogs from areas with higher poverty rates more likely to be presented for vaccination. Young dogs, pregnant or lactating females, and dogs that roam were less likely to be brought to static points. Lack of awareness of the vaccination campaign and difficulty in handling dogs were also common reasons given. The study suggests that positioning static points more centrally and providing timely information about campaigns could increase attendance. Providing information on how to safely handle dogs could also improve participation. The study highlights the importance of vaccinating puppies, as they constitute a large proportion of the dog population and are critical for maintaining vaccination coverage beyond the 70% threshold.
The paper describes a comprehensive analysis of the interactions between the tsetse fly Trypanosoma brucei and the mammalian host using RNA-seq. The authors compared the transcriptomes of tset salivary glands from infected and uninfected flies to identify genes that are differentially expressed. They found that infection with T. brucei resulted in a drastic reduction in the expression of most secreted proteins in the salivary glands, which likely changes the composition and function of the saliva. They also found that immunity, stress response and cell division genes were upregulated in the infected salivary glands. The analysis of the salivary gland transcripts from the different developmental stages of T. brucei revealed metabolic and surface coat shifts that may enable the adaptation to the varying immune and nutritional environment of the host. The study identified many novel genes that were differentially expressed between the salivary gland and blood transcriptomes, providing insights into the mechanisms of tsetse-trypanosome interaction. The reduction in secreted proteins may impact tset transmission to the mammalian host, and the increased immunity genes may help the tset survive the host environment. The findings provide a foundation for further functional studies to understand the molecular mechanisms of tsete-trypanosome interactions and develop novel methods to block disease transmission.
This paper describes the discovery of four new antileishmanial compounds produced by actinobacteria associated with ants. The authors identified 10 actinobacterial strains from ants and isolated 4 of them that showed activity against Leishmania promastigotes and intracellular amastigotes. The identified compounds, 1-4, are considered ionophores that reversibly bind and transport ions across biological membranes. Compounds 3 and 4 have good selectivity indexes against L. donovani and high Lipinski and Veber filters, suggesting they could be optimized for in vitro activity. Compounds 1-4 were identified in the natural environment and showed antifungal activity against Escovopsis sp. and other fungi, suggesting they could be used in combination with fungal antifungal compounds to create a chemical cocktail. The results suggest that natural products from actinobacteria associated with ants may provide a rich source of structural diversity and novel chemotypes for the design of new leishmanial drugs, offering an alternative to traditional HTS approaches.
This paper examines the genetic structure of Trypanosoma brucei, a parasite that causes African trypanosomiasis, in different foci in East Africa. The authors analyze samples from three foci in Uganda and one in Malawi to determine whether T. brucei populations are clonal or panmictic. They find that the Malawi population is genetically diverse and shows allelic segregation, indicating frequent mating, while the Ugandan populations are clonal and primarily evolve through mitotic division and mutation. The Ugandan populations show little evidence of genetic exchange and are stable over time, while the Malawi population has a recent bottleneck and shows evidence of mating. The findings suggest that the ability of T. brucei to undergo genetic exchange may depend on transmission intensity and reservoir host, and tset fly species. The study highlights the plasticity of mating within the genus Trypanosoma and how it shapes the evolutionary responses to epidemiological pressures.
The paper proposes a mechanism for how the brain can learn to extract information from temporal patterns in inputs through spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) in recurrently connected networks. The authors show that STDP can selectively encode information into the axonal delays of recurrent connections in the network, which are then used to encode the input frequency. The learning is dependent on the amplitude of the input oscillations and the mean recurrent correlation function. The network responds selectively to the training frequency and the time lag between inputs. The authors demonstrate this mechanism in a model of auditory brainstem neurons, where the fundamental frequency and harmonics of a sound can be encoded into the axonal delays of the recurrent connections, allowing the network to perceive the pitch of a sound with a missing fundamental frequency. The mechanism is expected to be relevant to other regions of the brain where oscillations are present, such as the cortex. The results suggest that STDP in a network regularly driven by oscillatory activity introduces a bias towards strong connections with a specific linear relationship between their axonal and dendritic delays.
The paper discusses a mathematical model to predict the efficacy of using systemic insecticides to reduce the transmission of Leishmania infantum in humans in areas where the disease is endemic. The model assumes that only infected dogs can infect sand flies and that infected sand flies can transmit the disease to humans. The model simulates the transmission dynamics between dogs and humans, and estimates the impact of varying intervention parameters such as insecticide efficacy, coverage, and duration. The results suggest that significant reductions in human infection incidence can be achieved by treating at least 70% of dogs with an insecticide that remains effective for at least 6 months. The model identifies the minimum requirements for an insecticide to significantly reduce human infections. The authors note that current systemic insecticides for dogs are not registered against sand flies, but some existing products could meet the identified requirements. The model does not consider other potential sources of infection or seasonal transmission, and assumes constant risk throughout the year. However, the authors argue that community-wide use of systemic insecticides in dogs could be a useful alternative or complementary strategy to existing control measures. The use of systemic insecticides would likely be easier to deploy than impregnated collars, but operational challenges and cost-effectiveness remain to be proven.
This paper describes a study investigating the regulation of apical organelle release in Plasmodium falciparum merozoites during erythrocyte invasion. The researchers found that exposure of merozoites to low potassium ions, as found in blood plasma, triggers a rise in cytosolic calcium which in turn triggers the release of microneme proteins such as EBA175 and AMA1 to the merozoite surface. The release of these proteins is distinct from the release of rhoptry proteins such as CLAG3.1 and PfH2b. The authors propose a model where surface translocation of microneme proteins precedes release of rhoptry proteins during invasion. They identified a key signaling pathway involving phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of EBA175, which is required for rhoptry secretion. They demonstrate that treatment with a phospholipase C inhibitor, U712, blocks microneme protein secretion and inhibits invasion. The study provides a framework for analyzing signaling pathways that mediate apical organelle release and identifying potential drug targets for blocking parasite invasion.
The paper investigates how antiangiogenic therapy can improve drug delivery in tumors with abnormal vasculature. It uses a mathematical model to simulate tumor growth and the effects of antiangiogenic agents on tumor vessels. The model shows that antiangiogenic therapy can decrease vessel density and leakiness, resulting in increased interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) within the tumor. This IFP decrease enables convective extravasation of drugs, which are primarily accumulated in the periphery due to the low pressure gradient. However, the decrease in vessel density also reduces perfusion and blood flow to the tumor center. The authors find that the delivery benefit of antiangiogenic therapy is underestimated since it reduces perfusion. The results suggest that antiangiogenic therapy in combination with chemotherapy can improve drug delivery in the tumor center by restoring intravascular pressure gradients, but the optimal dose of antiangiogenic agents needs to be carefully determined to balance perfusion and drug accumulation. Targeted therapies using large drugs may be more suitable since they can provide simultaneous exposure to both peripheral and central regions of the tumor.
The paper discusses the role of CD169 in the capture and transfer of HIV-1 particles by dendritic cells. The authors found that CD169 is a key factor in mediating the type I IFN-dependent enhancement of HIV-1 capture by dendritic cells. They showed that CD169 expression on immature dendritic cells is required for efficient capture of HIV-1 particles, while maturation of dendritic cells with TLR ligands results in downregulation of CD169 expression and upregulation of CD169 expression on mature dendritic cells. CD169 expression on mature dendritic cells mediates the capture of HIV-1 particles through GM3-containing sialic acid residues in the virus membrane, leading to localization of the particles at the cell surface and subsequent transfer to T cells. The authors also showed that CD169 expression on myeloid dendritic cells is conserved across species, and can mediate retroviral infection in addition to HIV-1 infection. They propose that incorporation of sialylated GSLs in the virus membrane is a mechanism by which HIV-1 evades DC-mediated restriction factors. The study provides insights into the mechanisms of HIV-1 dissemination and highlights the importance of CD169 as a key factor in HIV-1 infection.
The paper describes the results of an investigation into how mutations in genes involved in proteoglycan (PG) synthesis affect skeletal development in zebrafish. The authors found that mutations in fam20b and xylt1, which encode enzymes involved in CSPG synthesis, resulted in increased perichondral bone formation. They conclude that this is due to premature chondrocyte maturation and Ihh expression, which in turn triggers early perichondrial bone formation. They propose that CSPGs negatively regulate chondrocyte maturation and bone formation, and that the gain in CSPG levels imparted by PG mutants alters the timing of chondrocyte differentiation. The study provides new insights into the ontology of genes involved in PG synthesis and how CSPGs regulate skeletogenesis.
The paper discusses the ecology of Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome Virus (SFTSV), a newly identified phlebovirus transmitted by ticks. The authors conducted a survey in an SFTS endemic area in Jiangsu province, China to study the virus's natural transmission and reservoir hosts. They found that SFTSV-RNA was detected in both feeding and questing Haemaphys longicornis and Haemaphys flava ticks, indicating that the virus can be transmitted transovarially through this tick species. However, they were unable to detect SFTSV RNA in larvae after they had fed on a blood meal, suggesting that vertical transmission may occur. They also detected SFTSV RNA in small mammals like Erinaceus europaeus and Sorex araneus, which suggests these species may act as amplifying hosts. They also found evidence of SFTSV antibodies in migratory bird species Anser cygnoides and Streptopelia chinensis, which could indicate that birds may play a role in long-distance transmission. The authors propose that migratory birds may help explain why SFTSV has spread rapidly to distant regions, and that Haemaphys longicornis may serve as a natural reservoir for the virus. Their findings provide insight into the virus's ecology and may help inform measures to prevent its further spread.
This paper uses single-cell qPCR to study the dynamics of host-virus interactions in the cosmopolitan alga Emilianthus huxleyi. The authors show that there is significant cell-to-cell variability in the expression of viral genes during in infected cells, which they term an "infection index" based on the expression level of early viral genes. They find that cells with a low infection index are in an early phase of infection and exhibit early induction of genes involved in metabolism and defense, while cells with a high infection index exhibit late phase gene expression and show induction of genes involved in meiosis. They also find that susceptible cells exhibit different expression profiles than resistant cells, which suggests that the host metabolic state may play a role in determining susceptibility to viral infection. They propose that this cell-to-cell variability in metabolic activity may lead to the emergence of resistant strains within isogenic populations, which could shape the diversity of microbial populations by infecting the most dominant proliferative cells. The study demonstrates the power of single-cell transcriptomic analysis for studying host-virus interactions and identifying new mechanisms of resistance.
The paper proposes a novel approach to identify genes that gain or lose specific functions in cancer relative to normal tissue, using a network diffusion approach. The authors first construct sample-specific protein-protein interaction networks for each breast cancer sample and normal breast tissue. They then propagate information across the networks to infer sample-specific functions for each gene using the guilt-by-association principle. They find that genes that exhibit a significant change in function between normal and cancer samples are likely to have altered PIN topology, rather than differential expression levels. They identify 73 genes that gain functions and 47 that lose functions in cancer. They show that the genes that gain functions tend to exhibit elevated missense mutation frequency, while those that lose functions tend to have elevated nonsense mutation frequency. The approach is able to identify functions that are not detected by standard differential expression analysis. The diffusion-based functional activity profiles are found to be predictive of patient survival, indicating that changes in network topology may play an important role in cancer development and progression. The results provide insights into potential mechanisms of cancer treatment resistance.
The paper discusses how subsequent infections with different influenza A virus subtypes can impact the susceptibility, duration of infection, and viral shedding in ducks. The authors found that subsequent infections with the same subtype resulted in long-term immunity, while heterologous infections resulted in partial protection, with the degree of protection influenced by the genetic relatedness of the HA subtypes. They also found that the order in which subtypes were challenged influenced the outcome of subsequent infections. The authors propose that cross-immunity between subtypes can act as a mechanism to reduce transmission and promote antigenic diversity in wild bird populations, and suggest that factors such as exposure history, infection dose, and time between exposures likely influence the extent of competition at the individual level. The results provide insights into how population immunity shapes the emergence and spread of new subtypes in wild bird populations and how vaccination strategies could be designed to take this into account.
This paper describes the regulation of conjugation genes on a plasmid called pLS20 in the bacterium Bacillus subtilis. The conjugation genes are repressed during most of the growth phase by a gene called RcoLS20, except for a narrow window of time near the end of exponential growth. The researchers identified an Xre-type repressor as the main transcriptional repressor that keeps the pLS20 conjugation system in the default "OFF" state. They found that conjugation is activated by a plasmid-encoded anti-repressor called RapLS20, which belongs to the Rap protein family. The RapLS20 protein acts as an activator and can stimulate conjugation genes when RcoLS20-mediated repression is inhibited by a signaling peptide called Phr*LS20. This quorum sensing mechanism allows the pLS20 plasmid to be conjugated at all growth phases but is only activated during the narrow time window near the end of exponential growth. The addition of Phr*LS20 peptide inhibits conjugation, suggesting that it acts in cell-cell signaling rather than an autocrine signal. The results demonstrate that quorum sensing plays a role in regulating conjugation genes on pLS20, which differs from conjugation of other plasmids like pCF10 and pAD1.
The paper describes a genome-wide transcriptome analysis of mosquito Aedes aegypti strains that are either susceptible or resistant to dengue virus infection. The analysis reveals that mosquitoes that are susceptible to dengue virus infection exhibit a coordinated transcriptional response, with many genes showing differential expression between the two types of strains. The susceptible mosquitoes exhibit a higher expression of genes involved in energy metabolism, DNA replication and repair, while the resistant mosquitoes show higher expression of genes involved in cell growth and death. The analysis identifies modules of co-regulated genes that are associated with the susceptible and resistant responses, and finds that the resistant mosquitoes exhibit a more complex response with more genes involved. The JAK-STAT signaling pathway is found to be up-regulated in both susceptible and resistant mosquitoes, suggesting it may play a role in determining vector competence. The study suggests that mosquito defense mechanisms involve multiple pathways, including endocytosis and cuticle proteins, and that the resilience of Ae. aegypti as a dengue vector reflects greater evolutionary complexity. Comparative analysis of gene expression across natural populations may help identify key genes and pathways involved in determining vector competence.
The paper discusses the impact of large-scale ivermectin treatment on Loa loiasis infection in areas where both Loa loiasis and Onchocerca volulus are co-endemic. The study found that after 9-14 years of annual ivermectin treatment for onchocercias control, there was a significant reduction in the prevalence and intensity of Loa microfilaria in areas with higher initial endemicity, particularly in the Northwest and East projects. However, despite this reduction, a substantial proportion of individuals still harbored Loa microfilaria, indicating that ivermectin had limited impact on Loa transmission. The study suggests that adherence to ivermectin treatment is key in achieving this impact, as non-adherent individuals were more likely to harbor high and very high Loa microfilaria. The study highlights the need for alternative strategies to eliminate Loa and accelerate the elimination of Onchocercias in areas co-endemic with Loa, as ivermectin alone may not be sufficient. The paper also notes that Loa microfilaria can cause neurological complications in individuals with high and very high microfilaria loads, and that ivermectin treatment can reduce the risk of these complications among both adherent and non-adherent individuals.
The paper discusses how the orientation of genes with respect to the direction of DNA replication in bacteria affects the efficiency of DNA replication. The authors found that genes that are highly transcribed in the opposite direction of replication are more likely to be oriented co-directionally with replication, while genes that are weakly transcribed are more likely to be oriented randomly. This orientation bias helps avoid conflicts between transcription and replication. However, the paper also found that head-on transcription of genes that are highly transcribed can disrupt DNA replication, leading to DNA damage and loss of genome integrity. The authors constructed bacteria with inversions that reversed the orientation of genes and observed that genes that were highly transcribed had slower replication speeds, especially at rRNA operons. This led to increased sensitivity to DNA damage and higher mutation rates. The authors conclude that the orientation bias of genes with respect to replication direction evolved to minimize genome instability and avoid mutagenesis.
This paper describes the successful integration of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) into the genome of the parasitic flatworm Schistosoma mansoni, a major neglected tropical disease causing schistosomiasis. The researchers used pseudotyped HIV-1 virions with the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein to attach to the surface of schistosomes and transduce the virus into the parasites. They found that HIV-1 integrates into the genome of the parasite through the nucleus, not just the cytoplasm, and that this integration occurs through a mechanism that is distinct from that of the related retrovirus MLV. This represents a significant advancement in the functional genomics of NTD pathogens, as HIV-1 integrates into non-dividing cells, enabling transient transformation of adult and schistosula stages. The high-throughput approaches used to estimate the number of integration events and detect integration sites revealed that HIV-1 integrates broadly throughout the genome, with a preference for less gene-rich regions, and some integrations into the mitochondrial genome. The findings suggest that HIV-1 can employ either evolutionary conserved mechanisms or use diverse strategies of nuclear import and integration. This work should enable the development of transgenic schistosomes, gene knockout/knockdown lines, and gene editing tools for studying the biology and intervention of schistosomiasis.
This paper investigated the presence of post-translational modifications (PTMs) within the major leptospiral protein LipL32 from Leptospira interrogans serovar Copeni, focusing on lysine modifications. The authors analyzed protein samples from rat urine-isolated leptospires and in vitro-cultured Leptospira, and identified eight lysine modifications within LipL32 from the urine-isolated samples. The modifications occurred exclusively on lysine residues and were confirmed by mass spectrometry. The authors found that modifications of residues K152, K17 and K26 within the LipL32 epitopes identified as immunogenic regions reduced recognition of these epitopes by patient sera compared to the unmodified peptides. They propose that lysine tri-methylation within LipL32 may decrease immune recognition of this protein during infection, allowing for persistent colonization of the renal tubules and increased transmission among reservoir hosts. The study provides insight into the potential functional and immunological consequences of PTMs within LipL32 and a potential mechanism for the paradoxical high expression of LipL32 in the renal tubules despite a robust immune response to LipL32 during infection. Further investigations of the temporal and community-level occurrence of PTMs, as well as their effects on other leptospiral OMPs, may uncover the elusive function of LipL3 and reveal a novel mechanism of bacterial immune evasion.
The paper investigates how multiple infections with different pathogens can impact the existing memory T cell compartment. The authors found that multiple inflating responses from different infections can develop at the same time without impacting the pre-existing memory cells. Infections that deplete the existing memory cells, such as MCV infection, do not necessarily impact the size of the newly developing inflating memory cells. This suggests that there is an upper limit to the capacity of the memory compartment to accommodate multiple inflating epitopes. However, the host immune system can support multiple populations of epitope-specific T cells which may develop at different periods of time without any cost to the existing memory cells. The authors also found that acute MCV infection causes depletion of the inflating effector memory subset, but this depletion can be recovered by boosting with a second dose of Ad-lacZ. This suggests that the limiting factor preventing recovery of this specific population is likely the availability of antigen presented by antigen presenting cells. The results indicate that immunization with adenovirus vectors allows for the generation of robust vector-specific memory while preserving the existing memory pool.
The paper investigates the developmental mechanisms underlying sex-specific growth of mandibles in the stag beetle Cyclommatus metallifer. The study finds that the doublesex gene, which encodes a zinc finger protein involved in sexual differentiation, regulates the growth of mandibles in a sex-specific manner. The study shows that the four splice variants of doublesex are differentially expressed in males and females, with the male-specific variants promoting mandible growth and the female-specific variants inhibiting it. The study demonstrates that knockdown of doublesex in females makes them more sensitive to a hormone signaling pathway that normally promotes mandible growth, while knockdown in males reduces their sensitivity to this pathway, suggesting that a default state of mandible growth. The results suggest that a link exists between the doublesex gene and the hormone signaling pathway that determines the sex-specific growth of mandibles. The study shows that insulin signaling may also play a role in mandible growth, providing further evidence for the interaction between endocrine and sex determination pathways. Overall, the study demonstrates the complexity of mechanisms that regulate the development of secondary sexual traits.
This paper describes an approach to identify genes that regulate mitochondrial function and insulin secretion in β-cells and may contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes. The authors used trisomy 21 mouse models that have elevated expression of genes on chromosome 16, as well as human islets from diabetes patients. They identified a gene called Regulator of Calcineurin 1 (RCAN1) that is overexpressed in the trisomy 2 mice and human islets, and found that it causes mitochondrial dysfunction and reduced insulin secretion. RCAN1 expression was correlated with glucose intolerance and hyperglycemia in the mice and human islets, and methylation at specific sites in the genome was reduced in T2D islets. The authors demonstrated that RCAN1 overexpression reduces ATP production and mitochondrial function in β-cells, and that this leads to reduced glucose-stimulated membrane depolarization and insulin secretion. They showed that increased RCAN1 protein expression in mice overexpresses mitochondrial dysfunction and reduced insulin secretion, and that the effects are not due to off-target effects of the transgene insertion. The results suggest that RCAN1 may be a key regulator of mitochondrial function and insulin secretion in β-cells and could contribute to the development of T2D.
The paper proposes a new method called Affinity Propagation (AP) clustering to differentiate Rabies virus (RABV) isolates into subspecies or clusters based on their full genome sequences. This method is compared to traditional phylogenetic analysis to overcome the limitations of the latter. The results show that AP identifies four main clusters based on the full genome sequences, while phylogenetic analysis identifies more than four. The AP clusters are found to have a spatial distribution that reflects the geographic origin of the isolates, not the host species. The AP method is found to be more robust and efficient, taking 10 times less time than traditional phylogenetic analysis. The results are transferred to a phylogenetic tree to visualize the relationships between the clusters. The authors suggest combining AP with phylogenetic analysis to substantiate cluster allocation and improve classification of lyssavirus species. Full genome sequences from underrepresented areas are found to be useful for identifying additional clusters. The approach offers advantages in terms of transparency, speed, and downstream applications.
The paper discusses the role of the transcription factor Sox10 in the myelination of oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS). The authors find that Sox10 is required for the expression of the transcription factor Myrf, which is central to myelination in both CNS and PNS. They show that Sox10 directly induces Myrf expression by binding to a conserved enhancer element within the Myrf gene called ECR9. The authors propose a model in which Sox10 first induces Myrf expression in the promyelinating stage, then teams up with Myrf to activate the expression of myelin genes and other components of the terminal differentiation and myelination programs. They find that ECR9 is the main enhancer for Myrf expression in oligodendrocytes and that Sox10 binding sites within ECR9 are required for its activity. The study highlights the similarities and differences in the regulatory networks for myelination in CNS and PNS glial cells, and supports a model in which the ability to myelinate evolved independently in these cell types.
The paper presents a new statistical measure called the "regularity index R" that allows researchers to quantify the clustering or regularity of the distribution of branch points and termination points in a dendritic tree. The R measure is defined as the ratio of the observed nearest neighbor distance to the expected distance under a random distribution. The authors demonstrate that R correlates with the underlying input architecture of the neuron, and can distinguish different cell types based on their dendritic morphology. They show that R values are not strongly correlated with commonly used branching statistics, indicating that R provides new descriptive power beyond traditional measures of dendritic morphology. They use morphological models to show that dendrites with higher RInput values become denser and more regularly distributed, while RTP values are closer to 1, indicating more randomly distributed termination points. The authors believe that R could be used to predict the underlying input organization of neurons from dendritic morphology. The measure could be generalized to non-uniform point distributions and other statistics beyond nearest neighbor distances.
This paper investigates how dietary zinc intake affects susceptibility to pneumocococcal infection. The authors found that dietary zinc restriction significantly impacts zinc homeostasis in most niches colonized by Streptococococcus pneumoniae, but not all. In niches where zinc levels were reduced, there was an increase in bacterial burden and a subsequent decrease in murine survival time in response to S. pneumoniae challenge. The lungs were found to be the only niche where zinc abundance increased upon infection. The authors propose that dietary zinc restriction impairs the mobilization of zinc from the blood into the lungs during infection, thereby compromising resistance to pneumococcal infection. They also found that phagocytic cells had lower zinc levels in zinc-restricted mice, which compromised their ability to efficiently kill S. pneumocci. The work shows how dietary zinc intake influences susceptibility to pneumoccal infection by directly impacting zinc homeostasis in the lungs during in a zinc-dependent manner.
The paper describes a study on downstream antisense transcription initiating near gene promoters in human T4D/A1 cells. The authors used Start-seq to identify transcription start sites (TSSs) and downstream antisense transcription start sites (daTSSs) in human T4D/A1 cells. They found that daTSSs coincide with the downstream edge of promoter-associated features such as promoter-associated histone marks and chromatin remodeling factors. daTSSs also display enrichment for Pol II-associated motifs and transcription factors. The authors conclude that downstream antisense transcription is common at many mammalian promoters and may participate in the establishment and maintenance of a promoter-specific chromatin environment. The different epigenetic features seen at daTSSs compared to upstream antisense transcription sites suggest that downstream antisense transcription is encoded in genetic sequence. The study characterizes the sequence content and epigenetic features of daTSSs and finds that all three classes of TSSs display similarities in sequence content. The authors propose that downstream antisense transcription may participate in signal-dependent modulation of epigenetic content and direct the positioning of nucleosomes. The results provide evidence that downstream antisense transcription is not repressive and may interplay with other regulatory pathways.
The paper evaluates the usefulness of detecting the dengue virus non-structural protein 1 (NS1) antigen in human tissues as a diagnostic tool for fatal dengue cases. The authors tested three different NS1 capture assays (Early ELISA, Platelia NS1, and NS1 Agrip) on tissue homogenates from 23 Brazilian dengue fatal cases. They found that the NS1 Agrip assay was the most sensitive, detecting NS1 antigen in 91.3% of the tissues, followed by the Platelia NS1 at 60.8% and the Early ELISA at 2.9%. The NS1 Agrip was the most sensitive in liver, lung, kidney, brain, spleen and thymus tissues. The authors suggest that detecting NS1 antigen in tissues could provide insight into viral tropism and pathogenesis in fatal cases and may be useful in low resource settings where necropsies are not feasible. While the authors were unable to confirm whether the antigen detected was from tissue cells or circulating blood, the presence of NS1 in tissues could infer the presence of the virus. Further studies using anti-NS1 antibodies are suggested to help clarify this. While the specificity of the approach needs to be established, the authors conclude that detecting NS1 antigen in tissues could be a valuable tool for postmortem dengue confirmation and may be used as a complement to existing diagnostic methods.
The paper describes a stepped wedge cluster randomized controlled trial that evaluated the effectiveness of a crowdsourcing-based intervention to increase HIV testing among men who have sex with men (MSM) in China. The intervention included a multimedia campaign, online HIV testing service, and local promotion activities tailored to MSM. The intervention was developed using crowdsourcing and consisted of three components: a nationwide contest, regional designathon, and local contests. The study found that the crowdsourced intervention increased HIV testing by 8.9% compared to the control period, with 43% relative increase in HIV self-testing. The intervention was particularly effective among younger MSM who used social media. While the study has some limitations, it suggests that crowdsourcing can be used to develop tailored HIV services and solicit community input, and may be a useful tool for expanding HIV testing programs in low- and middle-income countries.
The paper describes the characterization of the OMCV encoded CD4 homolog A43 as a decoy molecule that blocks CD4:2B4 interactions and inhibits NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. The A43 protein is released from infected cells as a soluble molecule and binds to CD48-expressing cells with high affinity and specificity, preventing CD4:2B4 interactions. This blocks NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity against CD48-expressing target cells and also inhibits the formation of the immune synapse between NK cells and target cells. The A43 protein is shown to be functional in human NK cells, inhibiting IFN-gamma production and cytotoxicity. The authors propose that expression of A43 could provide a mechanism for rapid counteraction of innate responses soon after infection, reducing host control of viral replication. The paper highlights the potential of viral proteins encoding CD4 homologs as decoy receptors to modulate CD4:2B4 axes and manipulate immune responses.
The paper discusses the role of astrocytes in myelin synthesis in the central nervous system. The authors find that myelin synthesis in the CNS depends on both endogenous lipid synthesis by oligodendrocytes and extracellular lipids provided by astrocytes. When astrocyte lipid synthesis is compromised, oligodendrocytes are unable to produce a full myelin membrane and instead incorporate circulating lipids into their myelin membrane, which can be rescued by a high-fat diet. The authors show that astrocyte lipid supply is particularly important for the later stages of myelin synthesis and is required for the elaboration of a full myelin membrane in adulthood. However, when astrocyte lipid synthesis is selectively compromised in both oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, myelin membrane synthesis is nearly absent, suggesting that both cell types are necessary for myelin synthesis. The results have implications for understanding and treating myelin diseases, as they suggest that oligodendrocytes depend on astrocyte lipid metabolism or dietary supplements to finalize myelin synthesis.
The paper proposes a new method called gap-enhanced pseudo-likelihood direct coupling analysis (gplmDCA) to improve protein contact prediction. The existing method plmDCA predicts many false positives in regions with high gaps in the multiple sequence alignment, which can be alleviated by introduced gap parameters. The gplmDCA method includes the gap parameters in the inference process to account for the effects of gaps on the predictions. Experiments show that gplmDCA significantly improves prediction accuracy compared to plmDCA, particularly for alignments with fewer sequences. The improvements are most pronounced for proteins with high contact prediction values. The paper argues that the three dimensions of data, model and method are important for accurate protein contact prediction and that the gap correction behavior can be achieved by alternative methods of scoring the coupling matrices. The new gplmDCA method provides valuable input for future protein structure prediction endeavors, particularly as the number of available protein sequences continues to grow.
The paper investigated the T-cell responses to specific epitopes on the nucleoprotein of the Hanta virus (HTNV) in patients with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in China. The researchers identified five novel epitopes on the NP that were restricted by the major HLA class I alleles in the Chinese Han population, HLA-A2 and HLA-B3. They found that the frequency of epitope-specific CD8+ T cells was higher in patients with mild/moderate HFRS compared to severe/critical patients at the acute stage, and the frequency declined over time. The epitope-specific CD8+ T cells showed a stronger proliferative capacity in mild/moderate patients. The results suggest that T-cell responses to specific epitopes on the NP may play a role in controlling the severity of HFRS and could be a potential rationale for immunotherapy. However, the frequency of epitope-specific CD8+ T cells was low regardless of HLA alleles in the patients. The study provides new insights into the relationship between single epitope-specific CD8+ T-cell response, CD8+ T-cell functions and disease control in acute HTNV infections. Further studies on the epitopes and glycoprotein of HTNV could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the immune interaction between the virus and the host.
The paper discusses the impact of the 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak on the screening and care of African trypanosomiasis (HAT) in three coastal districts of Guinea. The HAT control program in the area relies on active screening campaigns, improving passive screening, treatment and follow-up of diagnosed patients. However, during the Ebola outbreak, active screening campaigns were abandoned and passive screening was greatly reduced due to fear of the population and mistrust of the health system. As a result, many HAT cases were left undiagnosed and the time between infection and diagnosis increased for passive patients. This led to a significant reduction in the number of patients initiating treatment and a reduction in post-treatment follow-up visits. Even though the Ebola outbreak resulted in a conservative estimate of 2% case fatality rate among under-reported HAT cases, the disability adjusted life years (DALYs) increased by 48.7% during the Ebola period compared to 46.7% before, indicating an important impact. The paper suggests that the failure to perform active screening left many infected individuals undiagnosed and likely increased the HAT burden in the area. The results highlight the need for more active screening campaigns and community involvement to limit the consequences of such crises and make HAT control programs more resilient.
The paper presents a genome-wide association study of schizophrenia using pooled DNA from men and women separately to identify sex-specific associations. They found a female-specific association with a SNP in the RELN gene, specifically rs73475, which is located in the 4th intron of the gene. The association was replicated in three different populations (Ashkenazi Jews, Europeans, and Chinese) with the same direction of effect. The association was found to be significant in the combined replication samples, even after excluding the most significantly associated sample. The study suggests that the RELN gene may play a role in the neurodevelopmental origin of schizophrenia and that sex hormones may modulate gene expression, which could contribute to the female-specific association. The finding of a female-specific association for this SNP provides new insights into the molecular basis of the sex difference in risk for schizophrenia.
The paper describes the identification and characterization of a novel gene, DUR31, which encodes a sodium substrate transporter that is specifically upregulated during oral candidiasis. The authors show that DUR3 is required for oral epithelial damage and endothelial damage, and is involved in multiple virulence factors such as histatin 5 import, polyamine utilization, environmental alkalinization, hyphal morphogenesis, epithelial evasion, and immune evasion. They demonstrate that DUR3 mediates the import of amine-containing substrates like spermidine, which are utilized for filament formation. The authors propose that DUR3 contributes to the capacity of C. albicans to actively alkalinize its environment under nutrient starvation by importing amine-containing substrates, and that this transporter is involved in the import of ammonium which is then released as volatile ammonia by other proteins. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of C. albicans virulence and contributes to our understanding of the pathogenesis of oral candidiasis.
This paper presents a model of the regulatory network that controls the differentiation of B cells from precursor cells to antibody-secreting plasma cells. The model is based on the known interactions between transcription factors and signaling pathways that regulate B cell differentiation, as described in the literature. The authors inferred the network from experimental data and found that there are two sets of nodes representing master regulators and signal transduction cascades. They constructed both a discrete Boolean network model and a continuous dynamical system model to analyze the regulatory network. The discrete model had four attractors representing Naive, GC, Mem and PC cell types. The continuous model had four attractors, in addition to the four in the discrete model. The continuous model was able to describe the known differentiation pattern from Naive to any of the three cell types in response to external signals. The results showed that the core regulatory network is able to control the differentiation process, and that some predicted interactions between nodes were missing from the literature. The authors suggest that the model could be used to analyze biological and clinical phenomena, such as deregulation of master regulators leading to lymphoma. The study demonstrates that the use of dynamical modeling approaches can provide insights into the regulation of complex cell differentiation processes even with limited quantitative information.
The paper presents a new Drosophila melanogaster model for studying diet-induced heart disease. Adult flies were raised on a high sugar diet (HSD) to induce diet-mediated metabolic and cardiac dysfunction, including hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and insulin resistance. The HSD flies exhibited shortened life span, progressive heart dysfunction including arrhythmias, decreased fractional shortening and heart fibrosis. The authors found that high sugar feeding increased the expression of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway enzyme OGT, which leads to O-linked glycosylation of proteins and cellular stress. Reducing OGT function in the heart specifically improved heart function and extended life span in the HSD-fed flies. The hexosamine pathway appears to play a key role in mediating the adverse effects of high sugar on heart function. The authors propose that dietary sugars act at least in part through this pathway, and that a balance of hexosamine flux is required to maintain normal heart function. The study identifies GFAT, OGT and OGA as potential therapeutic targets to reduce diet-induced heart damage.
The paper investigates how centromeres in Drosophila germline stem cells become paired and clustered during oogenesis. The authors find that while centromeres of chromosome X are always paired, centromeres of chromosomes II and III are mostly unpaired in germline stem cells (GSCs). However, centromeres of chromosome II become paired in 8-cell cysts, indicating that the remaining chromosome 4 is mostly paired. They propose that centromere pairing in germline cysts is an extension of somatic pairing, but that mitotic pairing in GSCs depends on meiotic proteins like C(3)G and Corona. The authors find that C(3)G localizes close to centromeres but not at centromeres, suggesting that it may facilitate centromere association but not homologous pairing. They also find that C(3)G is required for clustering of chromosome III centromeres, but not for X-chromosome pairing. They propose that additional mechanisms beyond C(3)G and Corona may also promote pairing of chromosome II and III. Their findings are similar to those in yeast, suggesting that similar mechanisms may exist in other organisms. The results open the possibility that the molecular mechanisms identified here in flies could facilitate pre-meiotic pairing in other organisms.
This paper describes a new reporter system that allows for the detection of Yersinia enterocolitica injection of effectors into host cells. The system uses a β-lactamase reporter gene fused to the YopE protein to detect injection of Yops into host cells. The reporter is expressed in Yersinia and injected into host cells, where the β-lactamase activity indicates Yop injection. The system was tested in cell culture and in mouse models, showing that Yop injection occurs with similar efficacy into different immune cell subpopulations, including granulocytes, dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells. The study concludes that Yop injection into host cells reflects the interaction frequency of Yersinia with distinct splenic subpopulations. The usefulness of this reporter system in cell culture experiments could be demonstrated by investigating the importance of β1-integrins for Yop injection, which is widely accepted as a prerequisite for Yop injection. The study shows that β1-integrins play a role in facilitating Yop injection, and that infection of mice with a low virulence serotype Yersinia strain (E40) is needed to detect Yop injection. The study highlights the importance of studying Yop injection in vivo in order to understand the infection process and identify genetic factors involved in Yop secretion.
The paper investigated the role of interleukin-10 (IL-10) in dengue viral infection. They found that serum IL-10 levels were significantly higher in patients who did not have specific T cell responses to dengue virus peptides (DENV-SS and DENV-NS3), indicating that IL-10 may contribute to disease pathogenesis by impairing T cell responses to the virus. In contrast, IL-10 blockade significantly increased antiviral responses such as interferon-gamma production, CD107a expression and TNF-alpha production to DENV-NS3 peptides, suggesting that IL-10 may inhibit DENV-specific T cell responses. However, IL-10 levels did not affect non-dengue peptide responses. The main source of IL-10 in the blood was found to be monocytes, which produce higher levels of IL-10 in patients with severe clinical disease. The authors conclude that IL-10 contributes to disease pathogenesis by impairing DENV-specific T cell responses, possibly by inducing apoptosis of activated T cells.
The paper describes the results of inhibiting the formation of hemozoin crystals in the insect vector Rhodnius prolix, which results in increased heme levels in the hemolymph and midgut. This leads to a shift towards oxidation and a reduction in redox homeostasis, which has effects on the insect's reproduction and Trypanosoma cruzi parasite load. The authors propose that heme crystallization is a key mechanism that allows the insect to maintain heme levels that are high enough for parasite growth while preventing excessive oxidation, and that inhibiting hemozoin formation disrupts this mechanism and leads to redox imbalance. This disrupts the interaction between the vector and parasite, ultimately leading to reduced reproduction and transmission of Chagas disease. The study identifies the mechanism of heme crystallization as a potential target for controlling Chagas disease transmission, highlighting the unique role of this mechanism in triatomine insects and Trypanosoma cruzi parasites.
This paper discusses the results of a study on patients who had a serological test for Brucella spp. antibodies, but did not have detectable IgG antibodies. The test showed positive IgM antibodies but negative IgG antibodies. The authors found that most of these patients had symptoms related to musculoskeletal problems, such as arthralgia or back pain. Despite these positive IgM antibodies, the clinical picture and treatment outcome did not suggest an active Brucella infection. The authors conclude that the detection of IgM antibodies alone should not be considered definitive for the diagnosis of brucellosis and that the result should be confirmed by repeating the test after removing rheumatoid factor and using other diagnostic methods like agglutination assays or PCR. They found that false positives in IgM tests can occur due to cross-reactions with other bacteria and rheumatoid factor, and that IgG antibodies may also be present in some patients without brucellosis. The study highlights the limitations of relying solely on serology for diagnosis and emphasizes the importance of combining serology with clinical history and other diagnostic methods.
The paper discusses how schistosomes, which infect snails, persistently infect snails despite the snails' natural defenses, and are difficult to control. The authors focus on understanding the mechanisms that allow some snails to resist schistosome infection. They identify fibrinogen-related proteins (FREPs) as key components of snail resistance, including FREP3, which has been shown to bind carbohydrates and enhance phagocytosis. They use RNA interference to knockdown FREP3 in naturally resistant snails and expose them to Schistosoma mansoni. They find that FREP3 knockdown snails become susceptible to schistosome infection, suggesting that FREP3 plays a role in the snail's defense against schistosomes. They also observe that immunosuppression by Schistosoma paraensei, which is less virulent than Schistosoma mansoni, can abrogate FREP3 expression and allow schistosome infection. They conclude that both schistosomes and schistosome larvae can manipulate snail immune responses to facilitate colonization of new host snails, allowing schistosomes to switch hosts. They propose that up-regulating FREP3 expression in endemic snails could potentially reduce schistosome infections. The study provides a specific mechanism to target for controlling schistosome transmission.
The paper describes an attempt to transform an African hospital serving long-term patients into a therapeutic community. The hospital in Allada, Benin, was transformed into a therapeutic community by establishing an open forum where patients and staff could communicate openly and honestly about their concerns and problems. This required the support of the hospital administration and the development of a social scientist role to facilitate this communication. The social scientist helped patients express their grievances and advocate for their needs and provided individual counseling for patients who preferred more private discussions. The pilot project improved communication between patients and staff, reduced uncertainty about wound healing, and increased patient knowledge about illness. The hospital administration decided to employ a social scientist and psychologist to continue the therapeutic community approach. The paper argues that it is feasible to transform African hospitals into therapeutic communities by recognizing the benefits of this approach and training social scientists in health systems analysis and conflict resolution. The authors suggest that patient-centered care that treats patients as active agents will be more effective and increase patient satisfaction, leading to positive word of mouth advertising and referrals for the hospital's community outreach program.
This paper proposes a strategy to extend the lifespan of yeast cells by reducing the rate of sphingolipid synthesis. The authors show that sphingolipids, which are structural components of eukaryotic membranes and signaling molecules for cell growth and migration, apoptosis, senescence and inflammation, play a key role in regulating the TOR complex 1 pathway, which in turn regulates lifespan. They identify a novel strategy to extend the lifespan of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells by reducing the rate of sphingolipid synthesis, which increases lifespan at least in part by reducing the activity of the Sch9 protein kinase. The authors propose that lowering sphingolipid synthesis reduces the activity of the Pkh1/2-Sch9 pathway, which programs cells for an extended lifespan. They demonstrate that down-regulating sphingolipid synthesis by genetically or pharmacologically lowering SPT activity reduces Sch9 activity and increases cellular resistance to stressors such as heat, oxidative stress, acetic acid and genome instability. The study suggests that down-regulating sphingolipid synthesis, at least in part, increases lifespan by Sch9-dependent mechanisms. However, they also find that myriocin treatment, which lowers sphingolipid synthesis, produces an effect similar to calorie restriction, extending lifespan even in the absence of adaptive regrowth. The study provides evidence that sphingolipids regulate lifespan by reducing Sch9-dependent and Sch9-independent mechanisms. The findings provide a potential strategy for extending human lifespan by modulating sphingolipid levels.
The paper investigates the role of intronic variations in protein-coding genes in human populations. The authors find that intronic variations, which are those that occur within introns but do not affect the coding sequence, are more common than expected and have different characteristics than exonic or whole gene variations. They show that intronic variations are enriched in regulatory regions and interact with gene promoters of other genes via chromatin looping. Intronic variations are also associated with gene expression changes in lymphoblast cells, particularly when located in long introns. The authors propose that intronic variations may impact gene expression by influencing the splicing process, RNA stability or RNA velocity. However, the study suggests that the impact of intronic variations on gene expression is likely underestimated as only lymphoblast cell expression was analyzed and the regulatory data is limited. Further studies using multiple tissues and multiple CNV types will be needed to fully understand the effects of intronic variations on gene expression and evolution.
The paper investigates how prior knowledge affects perception of degraded speech. The authors test whether representations of speech signals in the posterior superior temporal sulcus (STS) contain an enhanced version of expected sensory signals (Sharpened Signals) or an explanation of the expected sensory signals (Prediction Errors). They use behavioral responses, univariate fMRI activity, and multivariate fMRI pattern similarity to distinguish between the two coding schemes. They find that behavioral enhancement for matched written expectations leads to reduced fMRI activity, while enhancement for unmatched expectations leads to increased fMRI activity. The multivariate fMRI pattern similarity analysis reveals an interaction between sensory detail and prior knowledge, consistent with the Prediction Error model, where expected sensory input is explained away and deviations from expectation are represented as Prediction Errors. The results provide evidence for computation of Prediction Errors and not Sharpened Signals in the STS during speech perception. This suggests that prior knowledge is used to explain away sensory input and improve perception of speech that matches expectations, while unattended speech is sharpened. The findings have implications for understanding speech perception, as they support a Predictive Coding theory that representations of Prediction Errors are computed in the STS, rather than a Sharpening theory that directly passes forward sensory input.
This paper evaluates the diagnostic accuracy of three commercially available rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for the diagnosis of cystic echinococcosis, a parasitic infection caused by the larval stage of the tapeworm Echinocococcus granulosus complex. The authors compare the performance of the RDTs with the routine enzyme-linked immunosorbentase assay (ELISA) test used in a parasitology laboratory. They analyze sera from 84 patients with single hepatic cysts and non-parasitic cysts to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the RDTs for different cyst stages. They find that while the overall performance of the RDTs is comparable to the ELISA test, significant differences exist among the tests, with VIRapid HYDATIS performing best. The RDTs are poorly sensitive in diagnosing inactive or CE1 cysts, which can pose problems in differential diagnosis. Further studies are recommended to evaluate the use of RDTs in follow-up of cystic echinoccosis patients and to identify stage-specific antigens for more sensitive and specific tests. The results suggest that RDTs could potentially complement ultrasound diagnosis in resource-poor settings, but the low prevalence and low specificity of serodiagnosis make serology tests useful only after imaging suggests cysts are likely present.
The paper discusses the potential impact of a diagnostic test for subclinical leprosy cases (those who are infected but do not yet show symptoms) on the transmission of leprosy. The authors use an individual-based model of leprosy transmission in households to estimate the impact of a diagnostic test with varying sensitivity levels (50-100%) on the number of new cases detected and prevented over a 50-year period. They find that even a test with a sensitivity of 50% could significantly reduce the number of new cases in a high, medium and low endemic setting, with the highest impact achieved in a high endemic setting. They also find that household contact testing with follow-up is more efficient than a population survey, but the costs of household testing decrease with the level of endemicity. However, a population survey is more favorable in high endemic settings due to the higher number of people tested and treated. The authors conclude that a test with sensitivity as low as 50% could reduce transmission, but that a test with higher specificity would be beneficial to reduce the number of false positives. They note that achieving zero transmission may be difficult due to the long incubation period and detection delays. The study highlights the importance of developing and implementing a diagnostic test for subclinical cases to reduce transmission, especially in areas with high endemicity.
The paper examines the immune responses in adults vaccinated with two doses of the oral cholera vaccine Shanchol in Bangladesh. The study found that vaccination with Shanchol resulted in IgA, IgG and IgM plasma antibodies to Vibrio cholera OSP antigens, with significant increases in responses at day 7 compared to baseline, but there was no boosting after the second dose. IgA, IgG and IgM circulating antibody responses to Inaba OSP antigens were also seen, but were less prominent. IgA antibody-secreting cell (ASC) responses to OSP were detected in blood 7 days after the first dose and returned to baseline by day 4. Significant increases in OSP-specific IgA memory B cells were found at day 4, but no boosting was seen after the second dose. The authors suggest that these mucosal and systemic immune responses may play a role in mediating long-term protection against cholera, though more research is needed to assess their association with protection. The study calls into question the utility of the current two-dose vaccine regimen separated by 14 days and suggests that a single dose of Shanchol every year or two may be sufficient for short-term protection in highly endemic areas. However, more research is needed to assess the utility of this approach in non-endemic areas and in children, who are most vulnerable to cholera.
This paper describes an in-depth analysis of the recent outbreak of a bacterial disease of kiwifruit called Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa-V) that emerged in New Zealand in 20008. The researchers sequenced the genomes of 23 Psa-V strains, as well as 15 other strains from previous outbreaks, to determine the origins of the outbreak. They found that the Psa-V strains come from a single, diverse source population that has undergone multiple independent transmission events, rather than a single, homogeneous lineage. The analysis revealed that the Psa-V strains have low diversity within each outbreak, but high diversity between outbreaks, indicating that each outbreak has its own unique set of accessory genes and virulence factors. The researchers identified 17 effectors that are conserved across all Psa-V strains, which could be a useful target for breeding programs to develop resistance. They also found that the Psa-V strains have a high capacity for lateral transmission, which means new Psa variants are likely to emerge. The study highlights the importance of understanding the source population from which the disease emerged, both for disease control and plant breeding. The findings suggest that dense plantings of kiwifruit orchards may have facilitated the global spread of Psa-V and that breeding programs targeting a single lineage may not produce durable resistance.
The paper discusses the characterization of a CRISPR-Cas system in Listeria monocytogenes that does not rely on Cas proteins. The CRISPR system, called RliB-CRISPR, is composed of 5 identical 29nt repeats interspaced by spacers, and is expressed even in the absence of Cas genes. The RliB-CRISPR is processed by the endogenously encoded enzyme PNPase, which acts as a 3' to 5' exonuclease and RNA polymerase. The RliB-CRISPR spacers match numerous temperate and virulent Listeria bacteriophages and lowers the acquisition of a plasmid carrying a matching spacer, indicating it has a DNA interference activity. The DNA interference is dependent on PNPase. The RliB-CRISPR is conserved in all sequenced Listeria genomes and is expressed in Listeria species beyond the genus Listeria monocytus, indicating it is a functional element. The RliB-CRISPR is processed to a 280nt long form that is the most abundant, and some processing still occurs in strains lacking the Cas genes, suggesting there are other endogenously encoded enzymes involved. The RliB-CRISPR mediates DNA interference that is dependent on PNPase. The RliB-CRISPR is not 100% effective, likely due to experimental conditions or the CRISPR system not evolving to eradicate bacteriophages. The authors propose that the RliB-CRISPR may have evolved a new function that is not related to immunity, possibly RNA interference.
The paper discusses how contact structure can affect the topology of transmission trees reconstructed from phylogenetic data of infectious diseases. The authors show that transmission trees generated by different contact networks (e.g. random mixing, Barabasi-Albert, Watts-Strogatz) exhibit distinct tree topologies that cannot be distinguished from those generated by a random mixing model using a measure called the Sackin index. However, this measure can still reveal some differences between the different contact structures. They demonstrate this on an example of the HIV epidemic in Switzerland, showing that the actual transmission tree exhibits stronger imbalance than a model assuming random mixing, indicating non-random contact structure. They also show that the imbalance depends on factors like the number of neighbors and the mean path length in the transmission network. The approach can be used to test whether real epidemics are well-modeled by standard models assuming random mixing, and can also be applied to study within-host transmission within an individual. However, imbalance is only a crude measure of tree topology and other measures like branch lengths may be needed to fully determine the underlying contact structure. The approach has the advantage of using readily available genetic data, but may suffer from sampling biases and can only distinguish between types of contact networks, not the actual contact network.
The paper proposes a machine learning approach to predict which residues in a protein are likely to be allosteric hotspots, which are important for allosteric regulation. The approach uses a combination of structural, dynamical, and network features calculated from protein structures and normal mode calculations. The authors assembled a dataset of known hotspots and non-hotspots from various allosteric proteins and used machine learning algorithms to train models that predict hotspots and non-hotspots based on the features. The top-scoring models were then evaluated on an independent dataset and found to outperform existing methods. The predictions were found to overlap with known hotspots and were consistent with the location of hotspots in the protein structure. The authors suggest that buried residues are more likely to be hotspots, as they tend to be more buried and undergo changes in solvent accessibility during the allosteric transition. The approach can be used to guide experimentalists in selecting residues for mutagenesis studies to identify potential allosteric hotspots. The paper demonstrates that a machine learning approach that incorporates multiple features can predict hotspots with high sensitivity and specificity, potentially identifying residues that could be targeted by drugs to modulate allosteric regulation.
This paper proposes a framework for predicting patterns of functional connectivity in neural networks based on the structural topology of the network. The authors use a minimal model of excitable dynamics, the SER model, to study how topological features of the network influence the functional connectivity of nodes. They show that the topological structure of the network strongly determines the functional connectivity, but not the specific computational model used. They develop analytical predictions based on the number of triangles used as pacemakers in the network, which can predict the simulated functional connectivity across a wide range of initial conditions. The predictions are found to be robust across network realizations and densities. The results show that the topological predictors of activation patterns identified in the SER model can be transposed to more complicated models of neural dynamics, providing insights into how topological features contribute to the global activity patterns and function of complex brain networks.
The paper describes the cloning and characterization of the full-length genome of a new bocavirus, human bocavirus 1 (HBoV1), which was identified in nasopharyngeal aspirates of children with acute respiratory infections. The researchers were able to sequence the terminal hairpins of the genome from a clinical isolate and identify the head and tail sequences, which are similar to those of bovine parvovirus 1 and minute virus of canines. They then cloned the full-length genome into a plasmid called pIBoV1 and transfected human embryonic kidney cells 293HEK29, which were able to efficiently produce and infect primary human airway epithelial cells with HBoV1. The infected cells showed disruption of tight junctions, loss of cilia, and epithelial cell hypertrophy, indicating that HBoV1 infection disrupts the airway epithelial structure. The researchers also generated an immortalized cell line CuFi-8, which was able to support HBoV1 infection and exhibited similar phenotypes as primary airway epithelial cultures. These results demonstrate that HBoV1 infection of polarized human airway epithelial cells in vitro mimics in vivo infection of the human cartilaginous airway epithelium and provide a reverse genetics system to study the molecular biology and pathogenesis of HBoV1. The findings suggest that HBoV1 infection likely facilitates co-infection with other respiratory viruses and may contribute to lung diseases.
The paper discusses how the Wnt signaling pathway contributes to cellular processes during development in Caenorhabditis elegans. The Wnt pathway was previously thought to only regulate cell fate decisions and spindle orientation, but the authors found that it also plays a role in cell corpse clearance and DTC migration. They identified Frizzled receptor MOM-5 as a receptor that links the Wnt pathway to the cytoskeleton and is required for cell corpse engulfment. They found that MOM-5 functions together with the CED-10/Rac pathway, which is involved in cell corpse removal, to activate the cytoskeleton. The authors propose that MOM-5 acts as a co-receptor for the CED-1 receptor and that phosphatidylserine may activate CED-1, which in turn activates MOM-5. They conclude that both CED-1 and MOM-5 are required for cell corpse removal, while only MOM-5 is required for DTC migration and spindle orientation. The results suggest that a novel Wnt-dependent pathway exists that links the CED-1/Rac pathway to the CED-1/5/10 pathway for cell corpse clearance. The authors propose that this pathway is conserved across species and likely contributes to cell polarity regulation in mammals.
This paper investigates the role of the protein γ-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC) in organizing microtubules at non-centrosomal microtubule organizing centers (ncMTOCs) in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. The authors use a tissue-specific degradation system to deplete γ-tubulin ring components GIP-1, AIR-1 and other microtubule regulators from the intestinal epithelial cells of C. elegans embryos, and examine the effects on microtubule organization at the apical microtubule organizing center (apcMTOC). They find that while γ-TuRC components are required for microtubule nucleation and localization at the centrosome, they are not required for microtubule localization and growth at the apcMTOC. Instead, microtubules at the apcMTOC are composed of both γ-TuRC-dependent and -independent components. The results suggest that additional mechanisms beyond γ-TuRC exist for organizing microtubules at the apcMTOC. The study identifies the C. elegans ortholog of the plant MZT1 protein, which is a PCM-specific linker for γ-TuRC, and shows that MZT-1 is required for γ-TuRC localization to the PCM but not the apcMTOC. The study also suggests that γ-TuRC and AIR-1 are not required to build the majority of microtubules at the apcMTOC, but instead play a role in removing microtubules from the centrosome at the end of mitosis. The findings raise the possibility that γ-TuRC may function to concentrate tubulin heterodimers at the apcMTOC, leading to faster microtube growth. The results highlight the differences between the centrosome and apcMTOC and suggest that different mechanisms may be required to organize microtubules at different types of MTOCs.
The paper describes a computational approach to predict the fitness landscape of the HIV-1 protein Gag, with the goal of identifying regions that are particularly vulnerable to CD8+ T cell responses and could be targeted by a vaccine to reduce viral fitness and escape. The authors develop a model that predicts the fitness of HIV-1 strains based on the frequency of different mutations observed in a multiple sequence alignment of infected individuals. They find that the frequency of mutations is related to fitness, with fitter strains being more common. They test their model against in vitro experiments measuring the fitness of various HIV-1 mutants and find that the predictions are in good agreement with the experimental data. They identify certain mutation combinations that are predicted to be unfit and others that are predicted to have low fitness costs, confirming their predictions. They also show that their model can correctly classify mutants as fit or unfit based on their replication capacity. While the approach has some limitations, they argue that it could be useful for designing vaccines targeting vulnerable regions of HIV-1 that would reduce viral fitness and escape.
The paper proposes a new approach called Dynamic Signatures Generated by Regulatory Networks (DSGRN) to efficiently and accurately identify bistability and hysteresis in complex regulatory networks. DSGRN uses a state transition graph representation of the network, where nodes represent regulatory nodes and edges represent the interactions between nodes. The parameters are assigned to each edge and the system dynamics are described by a Morse graph, which encodes the nonlinear behavior of the system. DSGRN can efficiently identify bistability and hysteresis by searching for terminal nodes in the Morse graph, which correspond to trapping regions in phase space. The approach can handle networks with multiple inputs and outputs, and can analyze networks with up to 49 regulatory nodes. The authors demonstrate the approach on the E2F-Rb restriction point network in mammalian cells, identifying bistability and hysteresis in the network. They show that the approach can identify these phenotypes in a subset of the parameter space that is larger than what other methods could achieve, and that the robustness of the switch-like behavior is an emergent property of the entire network rather than a property of its subnetworks. The results suggest that DSGRN can be used to directly probe dynamics of larger networks, bypassing the current limitations of motif-based approaches that focus on smaller networks.
This paper studies the role of cyclophilins in regulating the replication of the tombusvirus TBSV. The authors identify four cyclophilins (Cpr1p, Cpr3p, Cpr6p, Cpr7p and Fpr1p) that interact with the p3 and p92 proteins of TBSV and show that these cyclophilins inhibit TBSV replication in vitro. They find that the TPR domain of Cpr7p is the most potent inhibitor of TBSV replication, while Cpr6p has a weaker effect. The TPR domain of Cpr7p inhibits the recruitment of TBSV RNA to the membrane, while Cpr7p also inhibits the assembly of the viral replication complex. They propose that Cpr7p likely associates rapidly with the TBSV replication proteins and pre-incubation is not needed to increase the strong inhibitory function. They also show that Cpr7p can inhibit the replication of other RNA viruses like NoV and FHV. The study suggests that cyclophilins could be important regulators or inhibitors of various RNA viruses, and their inhibitory effect on TBSV replication seems to depend on the TPR domain.
This paper investigates the interactions between the conceptus (extraembryonic tissue) and the endometrium during the early stages of pregnancy in cattle. The authors analyze RNA sequencing data from paired samples of conceptus and endometria collected at gestation day 18 to identify genes that are coexpressed between the two tissues. They find that many genes expressed in the conceptus are correlated with genes expressed in the endometrium, indicating an adaptive response by the endometrium to the conceptus. The endometrium modulates the conceptus through genes involved in chromatin remodeling, gene transcription, cell proliferation, metabolism, and signaling. In turn, the conceptus impacts the endometrium through genes involved in oxidative stress, chromatin remodeling, gene transcription, mRNA processing and translation. The endometrium also regulates the conceptus through genes involved in chromatin remodeling, gene transcription, cell proliferation, metabolism and signaling. The study shows that the endometrium is able to elicit an adaptive response to the conceptus, which is important for successful implantation and pregnancy. The authors suggest that understanding the interactions between the conceptus and endometrium at the gene expression level could lead to new strategies for improving pregnancy rates in artificial reproductive technologies.
The paper discusses the reliability of assessing clean faces as a potential marker for trachoma control. The authors conducted a study in Tanzania where they trained seven graders from different backgrounds (medical assistants, drivers, census workers, etc.) to assess the cleanliness of children's faces based on the presence of nasal discharge and ocular discharge. They found that the graders had good to excellent intra-observer and inter-observer agreement in their assessments, with kappas ranging from 0.6 to 0.83. The prevalence of clean faces varied among the graders, but the intra-observer agreement was higher than the inter-observer agreement, indicating that the graders' assessments changed over time. The authors conclude that as long as graders are trained and consistent in their assessment, the reliability of assessing clean faces as a marker for trachoma control is good and reflects the effort of families to keep discharge off their faces. They recommend adding the assessment of clean faces to trachoma surveys as a potential marker for environmental improvements.
The paper describes a genome-wide system to study non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) between natural repeats in budding yeast. The authors developed a system to study NAHR between dispersed and divergent families of retrotransposons in purebred and hybrid diploids of budding yeasts. They found that DSBs within a long stretch of unique sequences are not always repaired by allelic homologous recombination (AHR) as previously assumed, but instead 17% of DSBs repair by NAHR. Distal repeats are activated as recipients when break-proximal sequences are used as donors. The intrachromosomal position of donors is the primary determinant of NAHR donor choice, not sequence homology between the donor and recipient. The SSA pathway is the dominant NAHR pathway. DSBs outside repeat clusters are more mutagenic than DSBs inside repeats, indicating that DSBs within repeats have better repair options through SSA. NAHR through GC events is also observed. The results reveal that DSBs in unique DNA are more likely to lead to mutagenic rearrangements than DSBs in repeats, and that break-distal sequences undergo frequent NAHR. The system provides insights into the factors that influence NAHR donor choice and the relative efficiency of different NAHR pathways.
The paper investigates how the Abd-A Hox factor regulates the Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) signaling pathway to promote the formation of hepatocyte-like cells (oenocytes) in Drosophila. Abd-A is found to directly regulate the expression of the PntP1 ETS transcription factor by potentiating the EGF signal in oenocyte precursor cells. This is in addition to its non-cell autonomous role in directly activating the rhomid protease that secretes the EGF ligand. The study shows that Abd-A also plays a cell autonomous role in regulating the PntP1 transcription factor, which in turn activates other genes required for oenocyte specification. The findings suggest that Abd-A potentiates the EGF signal in a transient manner by activating PntP1 transcription, while also regulating additional targets that are required for oenocyte specification. The paper proposes that Abd-A regulates multiple genes in a gene regulatory network to control oenocyte development. Further studies are needed to understand how Abd-A and Pnt factors are physically integrated and how they interact to regulate target genes during oenocyte specification. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms by which Hox and EGF signaling pathways intersect and the regulatory networks required for oenocyte development.
The paper describes a new framework for tracking and analyzing multiple Drosophila flies in a video. The Flytracker algorithm is based on a graph-theoretic approach that accurately tracks individual flies in real-time, even when they interact with each other. This allows for efficient and accurate analysis of social networks and behaviors in large groups of flies. The authors use this framework to study the effects of social isolation on the social network dynamics of male Drosophila. They found that social isolation causes an increase in locomotion activity and local interactions, but has minimal effects on the global structure of the social network. The observed behavioral changes, such as increased walking distance, occur very early and persist over time, suggesting that social isolation may trigger long-lasting changes in flies' physiology. The authors also performed genome-wide expression analysis and found that social isolation leads to changes in genes involved in metabolism, which correlates with the observed increase in lipid content in isolated flies. The study demonstrates the power of using this framework to study large-scale social behavior in flies, which could be applied to other species.
The paper investigates the immune responses of two groups of people infected with the parasitic nematode Onchocerca volulus (O. volulus): generalized onchocercias (GEO) and hyperreactive onchocercias (HO). The HO individuals have more severe skin lesions and eye inflammation. The study finds that compared to GEO individuals, HO individuals have an accentuated Th17/Th2 phenotype with elevated Th17 cell numbers and IL-5 and IL-3 cytokine production, but reduced IL-10 secretion. The HO individuals also have reduced numbers of Treg cells and a higher ratio of CD4+IL-17A/CD4+IL-10 cells. The study suggests that the dominant Th17/Th2 profile in HO individuals may contribute to the development of hyperresponsive onchocercias, possibly due to microfilaria-induced antigen and IL-17A production. The study highlights the difference between the immune profiles of the two groups and how they may relate to the different clinical manifestations of onchocercias.
The paper describes a novel computational approach called SIEVE (SVM-based Identification and Evaluation of Virulence Effectors) that can identify secreted effectors in type III secretion systems of bacteria. The approach integrates sequence features from known effectors across different organisms to identify secreted effectors in novel bacteria. The authors trained the approach on secreted effectors from Salmonella Typhimurium and Pseudomonas syringae and used it to predict secreted effectors in Chlamydia trachomatis. They found that the approach could accurately identify known secreted effectors in both organisms, with high specificity and sensitivity. The approach identified a conserved sequence bias in the N-terminal 16-20 residues of secreted effectors, which they propose represents a putative secretion signal. They also identified novel secreted effectors in Chlamydia trachomatis that have not been experimentally validated. Their results suggest that the type III secretion system has a conserved targeting mechanism that recognizes secretion signals encoded by the protein sequence, but the specific residues involved are not easily identifiable by sequence similarity analysis. The approach provides valuable insight into the nature of the secretion signal and can identify novel secreted effectors in different bacteria. The predicted secreted effectors could be useful targets for developing new antibacterial agents.
According to the paper, platelets play a previously unrecognized role as "pathfinders" that guide leukocytes to their site of extravasation in the inflamed microvasculature. Upon onset of inflammation, platelets immediately arrest at distinct sites in venular microvessels, enabling neutrophils and monocytes to capture these cells. This cellular crosstalk leads to the activation of surface-expressed leukocyte integrins, which then promotes the successive extravasation of neutrophils and monocytes from these "hot spots" to the perivascular tissue. Blockade of this cellular partnership results in misguided, inefficient leukocyte responses. The authors propose that platelet-directed guidance of leukocytes to confined sites of extravasation enhances the efficacy of immune cell recruitment, which might emerge as a promising therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of inflammatory pathologies.
The paper describes the generation of a mouse model that lacks the protein CEP164 in cells that form multicilia. The authors used the FOXJ1 promoter to conditionally delete CEP164 in FOXJ-positive cells in the airways, brain, oviduct, and testis. They found that loss of CEP164 resulted in a significant reduction in the number of multicilia, particularly in the airways, and led to hydrocephalus and infertility in males. The authors found that CEP164 is required for proper recruitment of small vesicles to the distal appendages of centrioles and basal bodies during multiciliogenesis. They also found that CEP164 regulates the localization of certain ciliary proteins, including Cby1, FAM92A and INPP5E, and plays a role in basal body docking. The results suggest that CEP164 functions in selective transport of certain vesicle types carrying distinct cargoes into the ciliary compartment. The authors propose that CEP164 plays a critical role in regulating the trafficking of vesicles carrying unique cargos to the ciliary compartment. The conditional CEP164 knockout mouse provides a valuable tool for investigating the mechanisms of multiciliogenesis and the pathogenesis of ciliopathies.
This paper investigates the extent to which proteins become insoluble and aggregate with age in the non-diseased nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. The authors find that over 1000 proteins become more insoluble with age, and most of these are also aggregation-prone, meaning they have the potential to aggregate. They identify specific features that distinguish these aggregation-prone proteins from the rest of the proteome, including enrichment in aliphatic amino acids, increased β-sheet content, and the presence of self-complementary sequences. They show that reducing insulin/IGF-1 signaling, which extends lifespan, can prevent age-dependent protein aggregation. They also find that many of the proteins that become insoluble with age are functional in the soluble state, suggesting that misfolding and aggregation occurs with age. They propose that age-dependent protein aggregation may have a negative impact on the organism and could contribute to the aging process. They find significant overlap between aggregation-prone proteins and proteins that are involved in extending lifespan, suggesting that reducing the levels of these aggregation-prone proteins could protect against age-related diseases. The results suggest that inherent protein aggregation is a conserved process across species and may play a role in disease-related aggregation.
The paper studies how Salmonella enterica subspecies Typhimurium selects its target sites for in host cells. The initial interactions between Salmonella and host cells are found to be distinct from later stages of infection, such as binding and docking. The authors propose that physical forces emanating from flagella-driven motility are the main factor in determining the target site selection. They find that Salmonella's near surface swimming (NSS) on host cells increases the local concentration of bacteria on the surface, leading to stopping at topological obstacles like rounded cells and membrane ruffles. This stopping allows the bacteria to mediate adhesion and docking to these sites. They conclude that the initial interactions are governed by general physical principles and that NSS-driven stopping and docking are sufficient for targeting rounded cells. They propose that bacterial motility is the key factor in determining target site selection. They also find that membrane ruffles represent prominent topological obstacles that enhance the chances of stopping and docking. The results suggest that Salmonella's ability to recruit other bacteria onto ruffles may allow cooperative invasion. The study provides evidence that target site selection by Salmonella is based on physical forces rather than chemotaxis and that the initial interactions are general principles that apply to other motile bacteria.
The paper investigates how prions are transmitted through aerosols, which is a novel pathway of prion transmission. The authors found that aerosolized prion-containing brain homogenates are efficient vectors for prion transmission, with incubation time and attack rate primarily dependent on exposure time and PrPC expression levels of the recipients. They found that PrPC expression in neurons is sufficient to confer susceptibility to aerosol infection. The authors conclude that airborne prions follow a pathway of direct prion neuroinvasion along olfactory neurons which extend to the surface of the olfactory epithelium. The immune system is dispensable for prion transmission through aerosols, and the lymphoid organs are not required for neuroinvasion. The findings suggest a novel risk factor for laboratory personnel and those in the meat processing industry.
The paper describes an investigation into the proteolytic enzymes present in the adult and larval stages of the nematode parasite Angiostrongylus costarensis. The authors used gel-based approaches and multiplex substrate profiling by mass spectrometry to identify proteolytic activity in adult worm lysates and larval lysates. They found that adult worms contain at least one aspartic acid peptidase that is active at pH 3.0 and inhibited by pepstatin, as well as at least one cysteine peptidase active at pH 5.0 and inhibited by E-64. The cysteine peptidase specificity in adult worms matches that of human cathepsin B and L, indicating that these enzymes may be involved in nutrition. Aspartic peptidases were also detected and were found to hydrolyze protein between two hydrophobic amino acids. Serine and metallopeptidases were also identified in adult and larval worm lysates, with the specificity profiles differing between the two. The authors suggest that proteolytic enzymes may play important roles in the biology and pathogenesis of Angiostrongylus costarensis, particularly in nutrition and immune evasion, as well as tissue penetration. The study provides a first characterization of proteolytic enzymes in this parasite and lays the foundation for further research into their functions and potential as therapeutic targets.
The paper describes the discovery of a new gene, GliT, that plays a key role in protecting Aspergillus fumigus from the toxicity of the fungal toxin gliotoxin. Gliotoxin is a disulfide-containing molecule produced by Aspergillus spp. that can have cytotoxic effects on host cells and exhibit anti-microbial activity. Previous studies have shown that disruption of the gliotoxin biosynthetic gene cluster in Aspergillus leads to loss of gliotoxin production and abolishes the ability of the fungus to produce gliotoxin. The authors found that disruption of the GliT gene, which is part of the gliotoxin biosynthesis gene cluster, completely sensitizes Aspergillus to gliotoxin and results in depletion of intracellular glutathione, leading to cytotoxic effects. They demonstrate that GliT exhibits a gliotoxin reductase activity that can reduce gliotoxin to its monothiol form, which is secreted by the fungus. They also show that GliT expression is induced by gliotoxin exposure and that transformation of Aspergillus with GliT confers resistance to gliotoxin. The authors propose that GliT plays a key role in protecting Aspergillus from gliotoxin toxicity and that this gene may be useful as a new marker for selecting for fungal transformation. The paper also explores the potential of using gliotoxin as a pro-drug for antimicrobial therapy and its possible role in the intracellular antioxidant defense system of Aspergillus.
The paper discusses the results of mass spectrometry analysis of prion protein (PrP) from heterozygous patients with codon 129 polymorphism in codon 129 of the prion protein (PRNP) gene. The study aimed to determine if the polymorphism at codon 129 affects the relative abundance of two different types of PrP protein (PrPSc-Methionine at residue 129 and PrPSc-Valine at residue 129). The results showed that the relative abundance of PrPSc-Methionine and PrPSc-Valine varied between individual patients, even within the same patient, and did not correlate with disease onset or duration. However, the relative abundance of PrPSc-Methionine was higher in heterozygous patients compared to homozygous patients. The study found that PrPSc-Methionine was the dominant allotype in approximately one-third of heterozygous patients while PrPSc-Valine was the most abundant allotype in the other cases. The results suggest that the polymorphism at codon 129 does not significantly affect PrPSc formation or disease phenotype, and that other factors such as host and prion strain may influence PrPSc allotype. The results also suggest that the heterogeneity in PrPSc allotype ratio between patients may be due to aetiology rather than the polymorphism at codon 129.
This paper investigated risk and protective factors associated with early childhood developmental outcomes in a South African birth cohort. The study found that boys consistently performed worse than girls on cognitive, language, and fine motor developmental outcomes, with lower raw scores and increased risk of delay in any one of these domains. Maternal education, higher birth weight, and socioeconomic status were protective factors for developmental outcomes. However, maternal anemia and low birth weight were associated with poorer cognitive and language outcomes for boys, while having a greater impact on girls. The study highlights the importance of nurturing care and supporting young women to remain in school and the caregiver-child relationship to improve early child development. The paper emphasizes the need for interventions targeting maternal health and nurturing care, as well as addressing underlying biological mechanisms that may contribute to developmental delay. Despite some limitations, the study provides valuable insights into factors impacting early childhood development in low- and middle-income settings and can inform policy efforts to track progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals.
This paper investigates the patterns of allelic expression across different tissues of a single individual using both RNA-seq and mmPCR-seq. The authors sequenced genomic DNA and RNA from 10 somatic tissues from a healthy individual and identified 5185 coding variants that were heterozygous across tissues. They found that while gene expression levels alone can predict the exposure of a damaging allele, allelic expression varies across tissues. They used mmPCR-seq to quantify allelic expression for 74 deleterious and nonsense variants and found that 40% of these variants exhibited patterns of allelic expression across three or more tissues. Of these, 28% exhibited no allelic expression across tissues, 13% exhibited shared allelic expression and 4% exhibited variable allelic expression. The authors found that rare nonsense alleles showed characteristic lower expression across tissues, consistent with nonsense-mediated decay. They also found that 1/3 of deleterious alleles were imbalanced and exhibited different patterns of allelic expression across tissues. The results highlight the importance of testing multiple tissues to better understand the functional impact of rare, deleterious protein-coding variants. The study shows that incorporating transcriptome data can enhance the interpretation of such variants by providing insight into their patterns of allelic expression across tissues.
The paper investigates the impact of deleting the Ypd1 gene in Candida albicans, which is a key regulator of stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) activity. The authors find that C. albicans cells lacking Ypd1 can survive sustained SAPK activation, but in a different way than yeast. In contrast to yeast, C. albicans cells lacking Ypd1 do not die from sustained SAPK activation, but instead adapt by reducing Hog1 phosphorylation levels. The authors show that this adaptation involves the up-regulation of two-component proteins PTP2 and PTP3, which negatively regulate Hog1 phosphorylation. However, this adaptation is temporary and can be over-ridden by transient stress exposure to conditions that require Hog1 activity. They also find that repressing Ypd1 expression during infection actually increases the virulence of C. albicans in two different infection models, suggesting that the enhanced virulence may be due to the increased Hog1 activity. Their findings question the validity of targeting Ypd1 as a broad-spectrum antifungal target, as C. albicans' ability to adapt to sustained SAPK activation suggests that inhibiting two-component signaling may promote the survival of other fungal pathogens. The results highlight the importance of studying fungal pathogens in their native host-like conditions rather than in yeast, as the stress responses and mechanisms of adaptation differ between species.
The paper discusses how a single poxvirus protein, M03, encoded by the myxoma virus, can simultaneously regulate both the inflammasome complex and NF-κB signaling pathways in host cells to dampen early innate immune responses to the virus. The protein M03, a PYD-containing viral protein, interacts directly with the adapter protein ASC-1 and the transcription factor NF-κB1. M03 inhibits the degradation of IκBα, which allows NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription of pro-inflammatory genes. The authors show that infection of THP-1 cells with the M03-knockout virus vMyxM01-KO induces rapid secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF, IL-1β, IL-6 and MCP-1, which are regulated by NF-κB, in contrast to infection with the wildtype virus MYXV that does not. The rapid induction of NF-κB-mediated responses suggests that M03 inhibits the degradation of IκBα. They propose that M03 binds to both NF-κB1 and ASC-1 to prevent the translocation of NF-κB p50/p65 complex to the nucleus. The finding that M03 inhibits both inflammasome activation and NF-κB signaling suggests that the host cells use a common mechanism to sense the virus and rapidly induce these two responses, which M03 disrupts by interacting with both pathways. Further understanding the host sensors that detect the virus and activate NF-κB and inflammasome signaling may reveal more about how the virus evades the host immune response.
The paper describes the development of a multiplex PCR assay for the rapid identification of three species of Echinocococcus, including Echinococcus granulosus, Echinococcus multilosus, and Echinoccus shiquicus, which are important for cystic echinoccosis and alveolar echinocosis in humans and livestock in China. The assay uses three pairs of primers targeting mitochondrial genes specific to each species in a single reaction tube, and can detect adult and larval stages of the parasites. The assay was tested using DNA extracted from metacestode samples, feces and tissues of dogs and mice infected with the parasites, and showed high specificity and sensitivity, detecting Echinoccus species much earlier than traditional microscopic examination of feces. The method is expected to be useful for surveillance programs to prevent echinocococosis transmission and monitoring the effectiveness of control measures, particularly in areas where all three species are endemic.
The paper proposes a new statistical method called FarmCPU to improve the power and control false positives in Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS). The method uses an iterative combination of a Fixed Effect Model (FEM) and a Random Effect Model (REM) to simultaneously control false positives and confounding. In the FEM, genetic markers are tested one at a time with pseudo Quantitative Trait Nucleotides (QTNs) as covariates to control false positives. In the REM, the pseudo QTNs are optimized to define kinship among individuals. The REM and FEM are iterated until no change is observed in the pseudo QTNs. The method shows improved power and control over false positives compared to existing methods like CMLM and MLMM. The method also demonstrates computational efficiency by testing markers one at a time and only using the most significant pseudo QTN as covariate for each marker. The results show that FarmCPU outperforms other methods in controlling false positives, identifying new associated loci, and overlapping with known loci. The method is applied to real and simulated datasets and shows consistent results.
The paper discusses the role of complement in the initial defense against Staphylocococcus aureus infections, specifically the role of scabies mites in facilitating infection by inhibiting complement activation. The authors investigate the complement pathways activated by Staphylocococcus aureus and find that both the classical pathway (CP) and alternative pathway (AP) are activated, with the classical pathway playing a more important role. They also show that a scabies mite protein, serpin B4, inhibits the formation of complement components, particularly C3 convertases, via the classical pathway, leading to reduced opsonization and immune responses. This results in a survival advantage for Staphylocococcus aureus. They propose that the scabies mite proteins accumulate to high anti-complement activities in the confined space of the gut and epidermal burrows, allowing the bacteria to evade the adverse effects of complement activation. The collective complement-inhibitory function of mite excretory proteins and bacterial inhibitors promotes the survival of bacteria in the microenvironment of the epidermal burrows produced by the mites. The findings suggest that the interaction between scabies mites, bacteria and the host immune system is complex and may have implications for the development of alternative therapies for scabies.
This paper describes the structure and function of the novel TA (toxin-antitoxin) complex between the bacterial proteins MqsR and MqsA. MqsR is a small globular protein that functions as a ribonuclease and is highly upregulated in persister cells, while MqsA is a larger protein that functions as an antitoxin and binds to MqsR. The authors determined the crystal structures of MqsA and the MqsR:MqsA complex, revealing that MqsA has a novel fold and functions as a ribosome-dependent RNase. MqsR associates with MqsA to form a non-toxic complex and both bind and regulate the mqsR promoter. The MqsR:MqsA2:MqsR complex binds DNA via its C-terminal domain, while MqsA alone binds DNA via its HTH-XRE domain. The structure of MqsR reveals that it is a member of the RelE/YoeB family of bacterial RNases. The study provides the first structural and functional insights into this novel TA system, providing a basis for developing novel antibacterial therapies that target TA pairs.
The paper describes a study that investigates the use of a liposomal protein vaccine formulated with a TLR4 agonist (MPL-TDM) to enhance the immune response against experimental visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in susceptible BALB/c mice. The researchers found that liposomal rGP63 protein mixed with MPL-TDM resulted in a higher DTH response and higher levels of cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-12p40, IL-4) compared to liposal rGP63 alone. Boosting with rGP63 and MPL-TDM resulted in even higher responses. The study suggests that combining the liposomal protein with MPL-TDM during both priming and boosting resulted in a more effective vaccine, as evidenced by reduced parasite load and increased IFN-γ producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells after infection. The results suggest that a liposomal protein vaccine formulated with a TLR4 agonist and delivered through the subcutaneous route can be an effective approach to developing a vaccine against VL.
This paper investigates the mechanism by which the protein Sfi1 regulates the duplication of centrosomes (spindle poles) in yeast cells. The authors find that Sfi1 contains multiple sites that are phosphorylated by Cdk1 during the cell cycle, specifically at its C-terminus. They propose that after Sfi1 is duplicated, it phosphorylated at least four residues, which allows for its separation into two spindles during mitosis. However, these residues remain phosphorylated during the cell cycle, blocking Sfi1 duplication until Cdk1 activity is reduced at the end of the cell cycle. This is consistent with previous studies that show that Sfi1 is phosphorylated at its C-terminus and that SPB separation requires Cdk1 activity. The authors also find that dephosphorylation of Sfi1 by Cdc14 at the end of the cell cycle licenses the SPBs for the next cycle of G1. They show that depletion of Cdk1 activity leads to SPB reduplication, and that inducing Cdc14 activity in mitotically arrested cells leads to SPB reduplication. This suggests that Sfi1 is the first target of Cdk1 in blocking SPB duplication. They propose a model where Cdk1 phosphorylation of Sfi1 restricts SPB duplication until the end of the cell cycle, and dephosphorylation by Cdc14 licenses SPBs for the next cycle. The study provides insight into the mechanism that regulates centrosome duplication in yeast and could be applicable to other organisms.
The paper discusses how plants control their final organ size. The authors find that meristemoid cells, which are cells that exhibit stem-like properties, play a key role in determining leaf size. They identify KIX8 and KIX9 as two novel targets of the SAP protein, which is an F-box protein that regulates meristemoid cell proliferation by controlling the stability of PPD proteins. SAP directly interacts with KIX8 and KIX9, modulating their protein stability, and targets the KIX-PPD complex for degradation. This results in the downregulation of PPD target genes, which in turn leads to increased meristemoid cell proliferation and larger organ size. The authors show that SAP functions in a common pathway with KIX8 and KIX9 to regulate organ growth. They find that KIX8 and KIX9 are two substrates of SAP and that SAP targets the KIX-PPD complex for degradation. The study suggests that SAP may target other substrates beyond PPD to regulate the expression of PPD target genes. The findings provide a new molecular mechanism for how plants control their final organ size and highlight the potential of manipulating SAP, KIX8 and KIX9 homologs in crops to increase seed and organ size.
This paper discusses the isolation and identification of Leptospira serovars from animals and humans in Tanzania. The study found that diverse Leptospira serovars occur in a wide range of wild and domestic mammals, fish and humans in Tanzania, with local serovars Sokoine and Kenya being the most common. The study shows that isolation of these serovars can reveal high prevalence of leptospirosis in different animal species, including humans. The study highlights the need for isolation and identification of new Leptospira serovars from a wide range of terrestrial and aquatic species, especially in neglected regions where the disease is not routinely diagnosed, to better understand the circulating serovars and improve diagnosis and treatment. The use of local serovars in MAT can reveal higher prevalence of leptospirosis compared to reference serovars, indicating the importance of including local serovars in MAT for accurate diagnosis. The findings suggest that public awareness of leptospirosis is needed among high-risk populations, including farmers, livestock keepers, fishermen and abattoir workers, and medical staff, to promote early diagnosis and treatment. Capacity building for leptospirosis diagnosis, isolation and culture maintenance is also recommended to control this neglected disease in Africa.
The paper describes the results of a study in which the authors generated mice that express the early regions of the HPV8 genome under the control of the keratin 14 promoter in the basal layer of the epidermis. They found that these mice had increased cellular proliferation and were more susceptible to chemical and UV-induced carcinogenesis compared to mice that expressed the early regions under the control of the keratin 10 promoter. The authors conclude that expression of HPV8 in the basal layer of the epidermis is essential for the development of skin cancer induced by chronic UV irradiation, as it circumvents the cellular defense mechanisms activated by UV damage and allows the accumulation of UV-induced DNA damages. The study suggests that the expression of HPV oncoproteins in the basal layer may be a key factor in the carcinogenesis of non-melanoma skin cancer, as it enhances the carcinogenicity of UV irradiation by maintaining the cells in a proliferative state.
The paper describes a computational approach for identifying driver mutations in cancer cells by analyzing genomic sequencing data. The approach uses an evolutionary model of cancer development to simulate the accumulation of mutations in healthy cells and cancer cells. The model includes two phases: pre-initiation and clonal expansion. During pre-initiation, cells accumulate mutations over time, with each mutation conferring a random effect on fitness. If a cell reaches a sufficiently high fitness, it can escape homeostatic mechanisms and initiate clonal expansion. The model is parameterized for colorectal cancer and uses a flexible mutational fitness distribution during both phases. The Hitchhiking Index is used to identify potential driver mutations by calculating the probability that a mutation is present in a significant fraction of the final tumor cells, assuming it is neutral. The authors applied the approach to TCGA colorectal cancer data and identified 43 genes as potential drivers. The approach shows that the majority of mutations arise prior to cancer initiation and can be used to extract biological insights from genomic sequencing data. The model is flexible and can be modified to incorporate additional factors affecting mutation accumulation. However, the choice of threshold for the Hitchhiking Index is arbitrary and the approach relies on assumptions about mutation rates. The approach provides a useful tool for identifying potential driver mutations but further modeling and experimental effort is needed to validate the underlying assumptions.
The paper discusses the role of the Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC-5 and SMC-6) proteins in meiotic homologous recombination in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. The authors show that mutations in these genes, which are required for sister-chromatid recombination, lead to increased chromosome fragmentation and disomy in meiotic germ cells. They propose that this is due to the loss of homolog-independent recombination, which is not detected in inter-homolog recombination mutants. They argue that sister-chromatid recombination is necessary for genomic stability in meiosis, as evidenced by the absence of chromosome fragments in wild-type germ cells. They propose that the loss of SMC-5/6 function leads to a loss of chromatid cohesion near the site of homolog-independent repair, which can result in chromosome fragments. They suggest that damage-induced cohesion may also play a role in meiosis. They conclude that the study demonstrates that homolog-independent recombination is required for genomic stability in germ cells, and that the nematode model may be useful for studying the mechanisms involved.
The paper investigates the potential link between childhood adiposity and the development of type 1 diabetes using a genetic instrumental variable analysis (IVA) approach. The authors use genetic data from large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify variants associated with childhood body mass index (BMI) and then use these variants as a genetic instrument to test the effect of adiposity on the risk of developing type 1 diabetes. They find that the genetic instrument is associated with an increased risk of type 1 diabetes, with an odds ratio of 1.32-1.5 depending on the size of the set of variants used. The study provides evidence that genetic variants associated with childhood adiposity may confer an increased risk of type 1 diabetes, consistent with the autoimmune theory of the disease. However, the study also shows that the genetic instrument is associated with potential confounders like birth weight, smoking, and education, which could affect the results. The authors perform sensitivity analyses to test for pleiotropy and bias, but acknowledge that the assumptions of the IVA approach are stringent and difficult to fully test. The study provides moderate but not conclusive evidence that childhood adiposity increases the risk of developing type 1 diabetes, consistent with the rapid increase in obesity rates globally. The findings suggest that reducing excess body weight in early life could help prevent the development of type 1 diabetes.
This paper presents an analysis of epigenetic marks in the immature myeloid human cell line K56 at the resolution of 10 kb, focusing on identifying the major chromatin states and their relationship to replication timing. The study shows that the epigenetic marks can be reduced to four main chromatin states: an early replicating transcriptionally active euchromatin state, a mid-S phase repressive facultative heterochromatin state, a late replicating unmarked and constitutive heterochromatin state, and a HP1-associated constitutive heterochromatin state. The analysis reveals that these chromatin states replicate at different times during S phase, with the active euchromatin state replicating early, the repressive heterochromatin state replicating slightly later, and the unmarked and constitutive heterochromatin states replicating even later. The active euchromatin state is associated with high GC content and low DNA methylation, while the repressive heterochromatin state has a similar GC content but higher DNA methylation. The late replicating heterochromatin states show a higher GC content and are more methylated. The study also finds that the chromatin states are organized in large blocks along the human chromosomes, with the active euchromatin state confined to the early initiation zones and the repressive heterochromatin state confined to the U-domain borders. These findings provide insights into the organization of chromatin states along the genome and how they contribute to the spatio-temporal replication program.
The paper presents a model for how meiotic recombination interactions occur stochastically along chromosomes in different nuclei, but along the same chromosomes there is an even spacing of crossovers, which implies the existence of communication between chromosomes. The authors propose a mechanical stress-relief mechanism where interactions along chromosomes give rise to interference. Interference arises after each CO-designation event and localizes stress relief, which then redistributes stress outward. More subsequent CO-designations tend to occur far away from the initial event location, resulting in an evenly spaced array. The model is based on a beam-film model that uses mechanical stress and relaxation to explain the phenomenon. The authors simulate the model using the BF program and show that it can accurately explain experimental CO patterning data from yeast, tomato, and Drosophila. They find that non-interfering COs arise from evenly spaced precursors, while interfering COs arise from randomly spaced precursors. The model provides new insights into CO homeostasis, the obligatory CO, and the metric of CO interference. The authors conclude that the basic logic of the beam-film model provides a useful framework for understanding CO patterning and the role of interference in achieving homeostasis.
The paper describes a method to generate Trypanosoma cruzi parasites that express a chimeric protein consisting of luciferase and a bright fluorescent protein, mNeonGreen. This allows the parasites to be both bioluminescent and fluorescent, allowing for the detection and analysis of individual parasites in situ within infected tissue sections. The method involves fusing the mNeonGreen gene to the luciferase gene in the parasite genome, which ensures that every bioluminescent parasite is also fluorescent. The approach allows for the examination of the infection kinetics, tropism and host-parasite interactions in vivo, which has been difficult to study with the previous bioluminescence model. The CRISPR/Cas9 system is then incorporated into the reporter strain to enable genome editing in T. cruzi, which can generate null mutants and tag proteins within a month, reducing the need for cloning and improving the scalability of the approach. The system is demonstrated by recapitulating a known null mutant and tagging the mitochondrial enzyme topoisomerase 1A. The ability to generate fluorescent and bioluminescent parasites in vivo enables the examination of the parasite in situ, which will reduce the number of animals required for experiments and provide more information from each mouse. This extension of the bioluminescence model allows for a more detailed analysis of the chronic T. cruzi infection and its interactions with the host.
The paper discusses the role of the N-terminal domain of the herpes simplex virus protein pUL31 in nuclear egress. The N-terminal domain contains a classical bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) that mediates nuclear import of pUL31. However, the NLS is not essential for nuclear import of pUL31ΔN, which lacks the N-terminal domain. Instead, the N-terminal domain of pUL31 prevents pUL31 from interacting prematurely with pUL34 in the cytoplasm, allowing pUL31 to interact with nucleocapsids and contribute to genome packaging. Upon association with nucleocapsids, pUL31 undergoes a conformational change that allows it to interact with pUL34 and form the nuclear envelope complex. The N-terminal domain of pUL31 contributes to targeting mature capsids to the inner nuclear membrane. The N-terminal domain of pUL31 also mediates interaction with pUL34, while the C-terminal domain of pUL31 contributes to binding to capsids. The N-terminal domain of pUL31 is required for nuclear egress and interaction with pUL34. The paper proposes that pUL31 undergoes a conformational switch upon association with capsids in the nucleoplasm, allowing it to interact with pUL34 and form the nuclear envelope complex. The interaction between pUL31 and pUL34 involves multiple conformational changes. The study provides insights into the molecular mechanism of nuclear egress of herpesviruses and highlights the importance of the N-terminal domain of pUL31 in mediating interaction with pUL34.
The paper describes an analysis of the genetic factors responsible for Drosophila sechellia's adaptation to the toxic plant Morinda citrifolia. The authors identify a gene, Obp57e, which is responsible for the fruit fly's preference for the host plant's odor and resistance to its toxicity. They find that the loss of the gene for gustatory avoidance of Morinda fruit is the most ecologically plausible explanation for the adaptation, as flies with this mutation are able to lay eggs on the plant without dying. This is because the toxicity of Morinda fruit declines over time and the plant provides a nutritional advantage. The loss of gustatory avoidance is seen as a more likely explanation than the other two options of enhanced olfactory preference or resistance to to the toxicity, as it does not conflict with the fly's ability to detect and respond to the host odor. The paper concludes that the loss of the gustatory avoidance gene was likely the first mutation to occur in D. sechellia's adaptation to Morinda citrifolia, as it would have provided a survival advantage.
The paper investigates the entry mechanisms of the bacterial pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis into host cells. The authors use a combination of biochemical and microscopy techniques to identify the key factors involved in the process. They find that the bacteria initially interact with filopodia on the host cell surface, which leads to the formation of complex filopodia-rich structures that are in turn associated with bacterial inclusions. They identify a macropinocytosis-like pathway that involves the Rho GTPases Rac1 and Cdc2, N-WASP and the actin nucleation factor Arp2/3. The actin nucleator WAVE also plays a role. The SNX-PX-BAR protein SNX9 is specifically involved in the early capture of filopodia during entry. The study shows that this initial filopodial association is required for bacterial entry and that SNX9 is required for this process. The results provide new insights into the hijacking of host cellular actin dynamics by Chlamydia and highlight the similarities between Chlamydia entry mechanisms and those of viruses like HIV and Vesicular stomatitis virus.
The paper discusses the potential of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) inhibitors as anti-metastatic agents. The authors find that PARP inhibition down-regulates the expression of the intermediate filament protein vimentin in both endothelial cells and melanoma cells. Vimentin down-regulation leads to a reversal of the mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (EndoMT) and prevents endothelial cells from acquiring a mesenchymal phenotype. PARP inhibition also reduces angiogenesis and vasculogenic mimicry in melanoma cells. The authors propose that vimentin expression is a key factor in the transition from an epithelial to mesenchymal phenotype, and that PARP inhibition's ability to modulate vimentin levels may contribute to its anti-metastatic effect. The results suggest that PARP inhibitors may have multiple activities beyond their ability to repair DNA damage, including regulation of EMT and angiogenesis, which could make them useful anti-cancer therapies. The study highlights the importance of understanding the mechanisms underlying PARP inhibitors' activity to develop them into clinical use.
This paper aims to provide a systematic review of the risks of stillbirth and neonatal death at various gestational ages in term pregnancies. The authors conducted a systematic review of 13 studies that included 15,124027 pregnancies, of which 17830 were stillbirths and 2,34 were neonatal deaths. They found that the overall prospective risk of stillbirth increased with gestational age, with the highest risk at 42 weeks, with a 64% increase compared to delivering at 40 weeks. The risk of stillbirth increased by 1.49 women for every 1,000 pregnancies that continued to 41 weeks compared to delivering at 40 weeks. The risk of neonatal death remained the same between 38 and 41 weeks but increased beyond that. The risk of stillbirth was higher in black women compared to white women, with a 1.5 to 2 times higher risk at all gestational ages. The authors conclude that there is a need to provide women with information on the absolute risk increase of stillbirth when continuing their pregnancy beyond 4 weeks gestation and assessing individualized prediction models to reduce the number of women who need to deliver to avoid stillbirth. While the study provides robust estimates of the risks, it had limitations due to heterogeneity in the definition of low-risk pregnancies, lack of data on confounding variables and small study effects.
This paper investigates how individual cells in the notochord of an ascidian embryo elongate during development. The notochord is a single-file tissue, with cells arranged in a cylindrical shape. The authors find that the cells elongate through a mechanism that is distinct from cell division, involving a circumferential actin-myosin ring at the equator. The actin-myosin ring is positioned at the equator, where it is highly organized and contains proteins like cofilin, tropomyosin, and talin. This ring is contractile, and its formation involves dynamic cortical flow of actin filaments. The ring is positioned at the equator through a spindle-independent mechanism, which is different from the mitotic apparatus used during cell division. The ring generates forces that push along the long axis of the cell, allowing the cells to elongate. The authors find that the actin-myosin ring is contractile and generates forces that are converted into longitudinal pushing forces that push the cell along the long axis. This mechanism is distinct from the sliding of actin filaments through myosin activity used in muscle cells. The study demonstrates that the equatorial actin-myosin ring in the notochord cells is a contractile structure that generates forces to drive cell elongation.
The paper proposes a new method to integrate gene expression data and flux data to identify reactions that are transcriptionally regulated, post-transcriptionally regulated, or metabolically regulated. The method first transforms a limited amount of quantitative flux data into a genome-scale set of statistical scores similar to the ones obtained from DNA microarrays. The flux data is then used to obtain means and standard deviations for each reaction in the genome-scale network. The difference between the means and standard deviations is used to calculate Z-scores that quantify the significance of flux changes between conditions. The Z-scores are then transformed into probabilities of change that can be used to classify reactions as transcriptionally regulated, post-transcriptionally regulated, or metabolically regulated. The method is applied to a dataset of yeast gene expression and flux data to identify reactions that are transcriptionally or metabolically regulated. The results show that many changes in gene expression are not correlated with changes in flux, but some reactions that are transcriptionally regulated have a high probability of expression changes that is consistent with known transcription factors. The method provides insurance that the flux changes identified are likely to be real and not just due to experimental error. The flux scores are found to be more realistic when the flux data is constrained to experimental values, and the number of samples is increased. The results demonstrate the potential for the method to guide metabolic engineering and diagnosis of metabolic diseases.
The paper investigates the impact of environmental factors on gene expression in a genetically homogeneous Moroccan Amazigh population. The authors collected peripheral blood samples from three distinct Amazigh populations - nomadic, rural, and urban - in Morocco and measured gene expression using the HumanRef8v2 beadchip array. They found that while there was little genetic variation between the populations, there were significant differences in gene expression between the populations, with the nomadic population showing the least variation. The expression differences were attributed to environmental factors such as lifestyle and geographic differences, including exposure to pollutants, viruses, and psychological stress. The study suggests that diseases in urban populations may have different genetic factors than in traditional societies and that gene expression profiling alongside genetic association studies could be used to predict disease susceptibility. The findings highlight the impact of transitions from traditional to modern lifestyles on human immune function and disease susceptibility.
This paper presents a comparative genomics approach to identify a core set of genes that are highly conserved across many metazoan species but are not present in basal metazoans. These metazoan-specific genes were found to have functions associated with the nervous system, development, cell migration and neurite outgrowth, and cell fate determination. The authors used the nematode worm C. elegans as a model organism to study the function of one of these genes, tubulin folding cofactor E-like (TBCEL/coel-1), which was found to regulate microtubule stability in neurons. The study identified 526 metazoan-specific genes that were conserved across 24 metazoan species, but not basal metazoans. The authors found that core metazoan genes were less essential than conserved eukaryotic genes and were more highly expressed in differentiated cells. The genes were found to interact with each other and with conserved eukaryotic genes, suggesting that they evolved as redundant modifiers of existing cellular processes. The study provides a list of candidate genes that may be associated with human diseases, and some of the poorly characterized genes were found to have functional annotation in C. elegans. The authors propose a model where TBCEL acts as a microtubule destabilizing factor, recycling and degrading specific tubulin species to regulate microtubule stability.
The paper discusses a recent outbreak of rabies virus in Northern California that primarily infected gray foxes, despite the typical reservoir species being striped skunks. The authors used deep sequencing of virus genomes from archived tissue samples to investigate the genetic changes that occurred during the outbreak. They found that the outbreak haplotype was able to be transmitted by both skunks and foxes, with no genetic changes differentiating the skunks and foxes. The outbreak samples had an unusual sequence at the carboxyl end of the glycoprotein, which may have impacted virulence. The authors conclude that the outbreak was likely driven by a subset of foxes infected during 2009 that transmitted the virus to other foxes, with limited transmission to skunks. Further studies using reverse genetics are needed to identify which genetic changes were responsible for the increased transmissibility in the fox population. The results suggest that analysis of rare variants within a viral population may provide clues to ancestral haplotypes and the potential for future jumps to other species.
This paper describes the discovery of a novel chromatin effector protein called MRG1/MRG2 that regulates flowering time in Arabidopsis thaliana. The authors show that MRG1/MRG2 proteins recognize histone methylation on histone H3K4 and H3K36 and interact with the transcription factor CO to activate the key flowering gene FT. The MRG1/MRG2 proteins bind to the FT promoter region via their chromodomain and chromodomain domains, which binds tri-methylated H3K4 and H3K36. The MRG1/MRG2 proteins are required for stable binding of CO to the FT promoter, and their interaction with CO is essential for CO-dependent activation of FT transcription. The MRG1/MRG2 proteins are novel chromatin effectors that link histone methylation to CO-dependent flowering time regulation. The authors propose a model where MRG1/MRG2 interact with CO to activate FT transcription, CO binds the FT promoter, and MRG1/MRG2 binds to chromatin that contains tri-methylated H3K4 and H3K36, stabilizing CO recruitment to the FT locus. MRG1/MRG2 proteins act as a novel type of chromatin modulator, linking histone methylation and CO to activate FT transcription. The mechanism of FT expression after MRG1/MRG2 binding to trigger flowering transition remains to be investigated. The findings provide a new link between chromatin modifications and flowering regulation, and suggest that MRG1/MRG2 proteins may play a key role in modulating flowering time in response to photoperiods.
The paper argues that natural selection plays a disproportionately large role in shaping patterns of genetic variation within species with large population sizes. The authors analyzed genetic diversity and genome-wide recombination data for 40 species, including plants and animals, to test the idea that natural selection reduces neutral diversity more strongly in species with large populations. They found that species with larger populations (larger geographic ranges and body sizes) showed stronger correlations between genetic diversity and recombination rates, and that natural selection removed more linked neutral variation from their genomes compared to species with smaller populations. This suggests that natural selection, rather than genetic drift, plays a dominant role in shaping the distribution of genetic variation in species with large populations. The authors used population genetic models to estimate the impact of selection on neutral diversity and found that their proxy measures of population size (geographic range and body size) were good predictors of the strength of selection. They also found that species with stronger evidence for natural selection had larger ranges and smaller sizes, consistent with their results. The authors acknowledge that their approach has limitations, but argue that it is reasonable given the data available. Overall, their findings provide empirical evidence that natural selection plays a dominant role in shaping genetic variation within species with large populations, which has important implications for understanding evolutionary processes.
This paper identifies and characterizes two cholesterol transport proteins, EhNPC1 and EhNPC2, in the protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica. The authors find that EhNPC1 and EhNPC2 interact with cholesterol and are involved in cholesterol transport in the cell, particularly during endocytosis and phagocytosis. They propose a "hand-off" model where EhNPC2 is transported by EhNPC1 from the plasma membrane to the endosomes and other organelles. This transport is essential for the parasite's virulence and motility. The paper provides evidence for the existence of EhNPC1 and EhNPC2 through in silico analysis, co-localization of the proteins with cholesterol and other proteins, knockdown of the genes, and changes in cholesterol transport and motility when the genes are silenced. The results suggest that EhNPC1 and EhNPC2 are important for cholesterol transport in the parasite and have a "hand-off" mechanism similar to that found in mammalian cells. The study provides insights into cholesterol transport in protozoa and the potential of EhNPC1 and EhNPC2 as targets for anti-parasitic drugs.
This paper uses the Drosophila system to study the role of the SMN protein in stem cell maintenance and differentiation. The authors find that SMN is highly expressed in early development, particularly in stem cells, and then gradually downregulated upon differentiation. They observe that reduction of SMN levels in stem cells leads to growth defects and loss of stem cells, especially in the testes. They show that SMN mutants have abnormal localization of the Miranda protein, which is important for proper RNA splicing, and also have reduced levels of U2 and U5 snRNAs. Overexpression of SMN leads to premature differentiation in the larval CNS and testes. The authors suggest that the fine-tuning of SMN levels throughout development is important for proper stem cell function and that SMN levels are required for rapid proliferation. The study provides evidence that SMN plays a role in stem cell biology and may contribute to the selectivity of spinal muscular atrophy.
The paper presents the results of a province-wide survey to assess the distribution of triatomine infestation in Loja Province in southern Ecuador, where Chagas disease is endemic. The survey found that 35% of households were infested with triatomines, with 10.6% of triatomines infected with Trypanosoma cruzi. The most common species found were Rhodnius ecuadori and Triatoma carrioni, with Rhodnius ecuadori showing a preference for the domestic habitat. The survey also found that triatomine infestation was associated with factors such as the presence of domestic animals, poor sanitation infrastructure, accumulation of agricultural products outdoors, and the presence of fruit trees. The study suggests that Rhodnius ecuadori and Triatoma carrioni are particularly adapted to colonizing domestic habitats, while Panstrongylus china and Pycnoscelus rufuberatus are more sylvatic. The survey found that vector control insecticide spraying was a protective factor. The paper concludes that while the results indicate a high risk of Chagas disease transmission in Loja Province, government control efforts are inadequate, particularly in rural areas where poverty is high. The study recommends a systematic, sustained and monitored vector control intervention that incorporates community education and surveillance, and addresses socio-economic factors such as substandard housing.
The paper discusses the role of the adaptive immune response in the pathogenesis of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection in mice. The authors used adult RAG1- mice, which lack T and B cells, to evaluate the role of the adaptive immune response in controlling CHIKV infection. They found that while T cells are involved in footpad swelling, the adaptive immune response is not necessary for the development of footpad disease in adult mice. The kidney is the most consistently infected organ in these mice, even in the absence of adaptive immunity, and the viral genome mutates in a way that suggests it may be involved in persistence. The CHIKV/IRES vaccine candidate, which lacks T and B cells, did not persist in the mice, even in the absence of adaptive immunity, suggesting it is safe for immunocompromised populations. The results indicate that the adaptive immune response plays a role in controlling persistent CHIKV infection, but does not completely prevent acute disease or tissue damage. The study suggests that FP swelling may not be a reliable indicator of CHIKV infection, and that the presence or absence of adaptive immunity does not affect the amount of muscle damage. The findings have implications for the treatment and understanding of CHIKV infections in immunocompromised individuals, particularly those with HIV/AIDS and malnutrition.
This paper investigates the role of DNA methylation in regulating gene expression and plant development in the endosperm, specifically the Arabidopsis thaliana plant. The authors find that naturally occurring differences in DNA methylation within accessions can influence the expression of genes, including the gene HDG3, which is imprinted between the maternal and paternal alleles. They demonstrate that a naturally occurring epialle in the HDG3 gene can switch the gene from a hypomethylated, repressed state to a methylated, expressed state, and that this change in methylation is sufficient to cause the gene to become imprinted. They show that the methylated Cvi allele in the HDG3 transgenic plants is expressed in endosperm, whereas the maternal allele remains hypomethylated. This suggests that methylation variation is sufficient to explain imprinting variation in this gene. They also find that the loss of HDG3 expression in the Cvi accession leads to earlier endosperm cellularization and smaller seeds, consistent with the predicted effects of HDG3 according to the kinship theory. These results suggest that epialleles, or naturally occurring differences in DNA methylation, can contribute to phenotypic differences in endosperm and plant development.
The paper discusses the role of the Fhit gene in the development of genome instability in preneoplastic cells. The authors find that loss of the Fhit gene leads to a decrease in thymidine synthesis, which in turn causes replication stress and genome instability. The authors propose that this loss of Fhit provides a selective advantage for cancer cells, allowing them to accumulate mutations and become cancerous. They show that Fhit-deficient cells are more likely to acquire chromosomal alterations and become immortalized, and that these alterations are observed in mouse models lacking the Fhit gene. The authors conclude that loss of Fhit provides a common initiator of genome instability in preneoplastic cells and a driver of the transformation process.
This paper describes the identification and characterization of a new lectin from the fungus Coprinus cinerea that is involved in defense against predators and parasites. The lectin, called CCL2, was found to specifically bind to fucosylated core N-glycans in fungal glycoproteins, which are absent from invertebrate glycans. The lectin recognizes the fucose-containing trisaccharide GlcNAcβ1,4[Fucα1,3]GlNAc with a high specificity and affinity, which is also recognized by antibodies in the mammalian immune system. The lectin monovalently binds to this epitope on fungal glycoproteins, which leads to to to toxicity towards in insects and nematodes. The unusual binding site of the lectin at the interface between subdomains β and γ of the β-trefoil fold is different from other β-trefoil lectins and allows it to recognize this specific epitope. The high affinity and specificity of the lectin to the target epitope compensates for the lack of multivalency, leading to to to toxicity without clustering of glycans on the cell surface. The toxicity of CCL2 towards nematodes was surprising, as it acts through a novel mechanism that does not involve clustering. The authors hypothesize that the redundancy of the lectin genes in fungi is a strategy to avoid loss of defense effectors due to individual gene mutations. The study demonstrates that fungal lectins play a role in defense against predators and parasites, highlighting the diversity and plasticity of β-trefoil folds in recognizing carbohydrates.
This paper analyzes data from over 13000 germ-line mutations (de novo mutations) in humans to investigate the distribution of mutation rates across the genome at different scales. The authors find that there is significant variation in mutation rates between different individuals and datasets, but little of this variation can be explained by genomic variables like replication time, male and female recombination rates, DNA hypersensitivity, etc. They also find that the correlation between mutation rate and divergence between humans and chimpanzees is weak and declines as more distantly related species are considered. They conclude that much of the variation in mutation rates is likely due to biased gene conversion, not linked selection, and that little of the variation in diversity at the 1MB scale can be explained by variation in the mutation rate. They propose that the decline in the correlation between mutation rate and divergence is likely due to the slow evolution of the mutation rate at the 1MB scale. The paper highlights the challenges of predicting mutation rates from genomic features, and the need for further studies to understand the underlying mechanisms of mutation variation.
This paper proposes a theoretical framework for analyzing the correlation structure of spiking activity in neural networks. The authors use linear response theory to approximate the response of individual neurons and then build an iterative approximation to the cross-correlation between cells in a network, taking into account successive connectivity patterns of different lengths. They show that only local connections contribute to correlations in networks where inhibition and excitation are precisely balanced. When the balance is broken, longer connections shape the cross-correlation functions. The approach allows for quantifying the impact of network architecture and individual cell properties on correlations. The theory is demonstrated on simple networks of integrate-and-fire neurons, but is expected to be applicable to actual neurons with experimental data. The framework could help predict correlations in the presence of adaptive currents and may prove useful for inferring network properties from correlations.
The paper describes a study on how hepatitis C virus (HCV) enters hepatocytes. The study used a combination of siRNA screening and single particle tracking to identify cellular factors involved in HCV entry. The siRNA screen identified 16 genes involved in membrane trafficking pathways, including clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The study then used DiD-labeled HCV particles to visualize HCV trafficking in real time. DiD-HCV particles were found to co-localize with cellular markers like clathrin light chain, E3 ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl, and receptors like CD81 and claudin-1. DiD-HCV entry required CD81 and actin stress fibers, but did not require tight junctions. DiD-HCV particles moved along actin stress fibers and internalized via clathrin-coated pits. The study proposes a model of HCV entry into Huh-7.5 cells, where actin-based transport facilitates binding to filopodia, followed by receptor binding and internalization via clathrin pits. Once internalized, HCV migrates along actin stress fibers to endosomes and is sorted for degradation. The study suggests that actin and clathrin-mediated endocytosis are important for HCV entry, but that tight junctions are not required. The results have implications for HCV therapeutic development, as HCV entry precedes assembly of infectious virus and is likely to occur at tight junctions in vivo.
The paper presents an analysis of the costs of eliminating and eradicating lymphatic filariasis, a neglected tropical disease that causes chronic disability and poverty. The authors use a micro-costing approach to estimate the financial and economic investments required to achieve elimination and eradication of the disease through mass drug administration (MDA) scale-up. They model different scenarios, including expanding MDA to all endemic countries, intensifying efforts, and treating all endemic populations immediately. They find that faster MDA scale-up leads to lower costs, but extending coverage to all endemic countries requires significant investment. The total financial costs to eliminate and eradicate the disease range from $7.5 billion to $8.0 billion, with $4.5 billion due to the value of donated drugs. The study highlights the importance of accelerating MDA scale-up to reduce costs and achieve disease eradication, but notes that deciding to pursue eradication rather than elimination means continued costs and risks of failure. While the analysis does not consider morbidity management costs, it shows that accelerating MDA scale-up could be more cost-effective in the long term. However, the paper notes that achieving certification of elimination and assessing whether eradication has been achieved would require additional investment. The authors acknowledge the limitations of their assumptions and uncertainties in the analysis, but argue that more cost data would be valuable to inform planning and decision-making. Overall, the study demonstrates that achieving lymphatic filariasis eradication would require significant investment, but could yield long-term health and social benefits.
This paper examines the relationship between environmental quality and mutualism strength in the mutualism between plants and ants. The authors find that the strength of the mutualism between trees and ants increases with water stress, which they argue is caused by the increased carbon stress on the plants. They test this by measuring the number of scale insects that feed ants and the size of ant colonies, which are related to water availability across a precipitation gradient of 26 sites in Mesoamerica. They find that trees in drier sites support more scale insects and have larger ant colonies, indicating increased carbon investment in defense, which in turn makes the mutualism stronger. The authors propose that water stress, mediated by carbon stress, is the key factor driving the strength of the mutualism. This is consistent with previous studies showing that water stress leads to carbon starvation and the plants investing more in ant defense. The authors argue that the drought-induced risk of carbon starvation in plants is an important physiological mechanism mediating plant mutualistic strategies in many systems. They suggest that extreme drought events, which are likely to increase in frequency with climate change, will select for the evolution of stronger mutualisms between plants and ants.
This paper investigates whether the Argonaute protein Argonaute 2 (AGO2) or the piwi protein Piwi can recruit the histone protein HP1 to chromatin in somatic tissues. The authors use genetic and biochemical approaches to test whether AGO2 or Piwi directly recruit HP1 to chromatin in somatic tissues. They find that while AGO2 mutants display increased silencing of transcriptional reporters located near piRNA clusters, Piwi mutants do not lead to a corresponding increase in HP1 association with chromatin. In contrast, loss of piRNA production at a single piRNA locus results in expansion of HP1 at the centromere. These results suggest that HP1 association with chromatin can occur independently of AGO2 and Piwi in somatic tissue. The authors propose that piRNA clusters may act as boundaries to the spread of pericentromeric heterochromatin and that Piwi may compete with AGO for HP1 binding. The study concludes that AGO is unlikely to be required for HP1 recruitment in somatic tissues.
The paper presents the results of a pharmacokinetic (PK) study of praziquantel (PZQ) in patients infected with O. viverrini. The study aimed to investigate the enantioselective disposition of the drug in blood, plasma and dried blood spot (DBS) samples from 111 patients treated with a 3-dose regimen of PZQ. The results showed that the racemic PZQ had higher AUC0-24h values than the stereoisomers in all patients, with the stereoisomers peaking at the same time. The metabolite R-trans-4-OH had higher AUC0-24h than the parent molecules, possibly indicating its role in the opisthorchic activity of PZQ. There was high variability in analyte concentrations between patients, which may be due to high first-pass metabolism, multiple dosing and co-infections. The DBS samples had lower concentrations of the parent enantiomers compared to plasma, consistent with the high affinity of PZQ for plasma proteins. However, the metabolite R-trans-4-OH showed higher concentrations in DBS compared to plasma, likely due to lower affinity for plasma proteins. The study demonstrated that DBS is a valid alternative to plasma sampling for PK studies of PZQ. Further studies are needed to investigate the PK/PD relationship and the role of the metabolite in the opisthorchic activity of PZQ.
The paper describes the use of a conditional degron system to reduce the expression of two essential enzymes involved in the synthesis of nucleotide sugars, UDP-Glc and UDP-Gal, in Leishmania major promastigotes. The enzymes are UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (UGP) and UDP-galactopyranose mutase (USP). The authors deleted one of the USP alleles in the UGP deficient mutant and replaced it with a gene encoding a destabilizing domain to enable conditional degradation of the remaining USP. This resulted in partial reduction of the UDP-Glc and UDP-Gal biosynthesis, which was sufficient to cause growth arrest and cell death at low concentrations of the drug. The authors conclude that UDP-Glc and/UDP-Gal are essential metabolites for Leishmania promastigotes, as evidenced by the growth arrest and cell death observed at low drug concentrations, and the maintenance of normal UDP-Gal and UDP-Glc levels under these conditions. They propose that the loss of UDP-Gal/Glc biosynthesis may be linked to a shutdown of LPG biosynthesis, which is dispensable for in vitro growth. They also suggest that the UDP-Glc biosynthesis in the nucleus and endoplasmic reticulum is important for Leishmania survival. The results provide evidence for the essentiality of UDP-Glc/UDP-Gal biosynthesis in Leishmania and identify the need for further studies to define the downstream pathways requiring these metabolites and develop specific drugs targeting the UDP-Glc/UDP-Gal biosynthesis pathways.
The paper describes an investigation into the relationship between the size and density of prion strains and their infectivity. The authors used sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium techniques to separate prion particles based on their size and density. They found that the most infectious prion particles, regardless of the strain, sedimented in the middle of the gradient, while the lower density particles were more infectious. They also showed that small, PK-resistant prion particles had higher templating efficiency and resisted proteolysis better than larger particles. They conclude that a small size, rather than low density, is the main factor determining the infectivity of fast prion strains. The study suggests that the most infectious prion particles are oligomers rather than larger aggregates, and that this oligomeric form is strain-encoded and participates in the pathogenesis of prion diseases. The findings support the idea that the size of prion particles, rather than their density, is a key factor in determining their infectivity and ability to transmit disease.
This paper investigates the therapeutic efficacy of systemically delivering miR-101 to mice with orthotopic liver implanted hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumors. The study found that systemic delivery of miR-101 via lentivirus substantially inhibited tumor growth and metastasis in mice without observable toxicity. High levels of miR-101 in the liver, lung and tumors of mice were observed after delivery, and levels were significantly lower in HCC patients with distant metastasis compared to those without metastasis. The study suggests that miR-101 may be a useful anti-HCC therapeutic strategy through its ability to broadly suppress tumor cell invasiveness and angiogenesis. miR-101 was shown to target multiple genes including EZH2, COX2, STMN1, MCL-1 and ROCK2, which play roles in cell adhesion, migration, invasion and angiogenesis. The study proposes a model where miR-101 inhibits HCC development and progression by a "one-hit/multiple-target" mechanism through its ability to suppress multiple molecular targets and activate the RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway. The results provide a basis for clinical trials of miR-101 as a potential anti-HCC therapy.
The paper describes a new method to isolate and characterize different myeloid progenitor populations in the fetal liver. The authors used a Runx1-GFP::P2-hCD4 reporter mouse to identify progenitors that express the CD41 marker and had high expression of the CD5 marker. They found that the CD5+CD150+ MEPs and CD5+CD150+ CMPs had the highest CFU-C activity and were the most likely to produce megakaryocytes and erythrocytes. They identified two subfractions within the CD5+CD10+ MEPs, the CD5lowCD150+ CMPs which were more proerythroid and the CD5+CD10+CD50+ CMPs which were more multipotent. They found that the CD5+CD10+ CMPs were more granulocyte/monocyte restricted. They also identified CD3, CD4 and CD11 as markers that correlated with P2-hCD4 expression and were used to isolate the different subpopulations. They found that the CD1low CD150+ CMPs were more proerythroid and had a megakaryocyte bias, while the CD3high CD150+ CMPs were more granulocyte/monocyte restricted. They showed that the absence of the Runx1B isoform in the Runx1-null mouse resulted in impaired megakaryocytic and erythroid differentiation, while the absence of the Runx1C isoform had limited impact. The authors conclude that the Runx1B and Runx1C isoforms have distinct roles in fetal liver hematopoies and that the CD3high CD150+ CMPs are more progranulocyte/monocyte restricted. The results provide a detailed myeloid progenitor hierarchy in the fetal liver that can be used to analyze hematopoietic disorders.
The paper evaluates the implementation of a case-area targeted response (CATI) strategy in Haiti to control cholera outbreaks during 2013-2017. The CATI strategy involved rapid response mobile teams comprised of local staff hired by UNICEF, which were asked to respond to suspected cholera cases and nearby neighbors within 48 hours. Mobile teams reported their interventions to UNICEF using standardized online spreadsheets. The strategy included house decontamination, water treatment, and education. The study found that 75% of alerts received a response in the same week during the last semester of the four-year period, and complete CATIs increased from 6% to 14%. The response was found to be significantly influenced by the commune, department, and responsible NGO. The response was found to be more complete for red alerts affecting more populated communes. While the response was initially insufficient, it improved over time, suggesting that a buffer period was needed to establish coordination and support. The response was found to be heterogeneous between NGOs and communes. The study shows that the CATI strategy was feasible at an annual cost of less than $1 USD per inhabitant and could contribute to reducing cholera incidence. However, more work is needed to improve response exhaustiveness, intensity and quality.
The paper describes a new animal model of post-treatment control of HIV-1 infection in Indian rhesus macaques. The model uses a transmitted founder SIVsmFTq strain that is less pathogenic than the highly adapted SIVmac239 strain and is more readily controlled with antiretroviral therapy. The animals received ART for 9 months, which resulted in a partial restoration of CD4+ T cells and a reduction of the reservoir. After 9 months of ART, the animals were stopped and rapid HIV rebound occurred. The authors then tested whether RMD (an HDACi) could reactivate the latent virus from the reservoir. They found that RMD did indeed reactivate the virus, but the increase in plasma viral load was modest and did not result in significant loss of immune cell function. They conclude that RMD may be able to reduce the size of the reservoir, but more studies are needed to assess this.
The paper presents an analysis of the gene expression changes during the differentiation of T2EC cells, a type of avian erythroid progenitor cells. The study shows that gene expression variability increases significantly during the first 8 hours of differentiation, reaching a peak at 24 hours, and then decreases. This increase in gene expression variability precedes changes in cell size and a drop in correlation between genes, indicating a critical phase transition. The authors propose that this increase in variability is a sign of the cells committing to differentiation. They demonstrate that cells are unable to revert back to the self-renewal state after 24 hours of differentiation, providing evidence for a point of no return. They identify several genes that may be early sensors of this transition. The paper highlights the potential importance of single-cell gene expression analysis in studying the dynamics of cell differentiation and the role of cell-to-cell heterogeneity in this process. The study suggests that cell differentiation is a critical phase transition driven by stochastic gene expression, rather than a gradual change in gene expression.
The paper discusses the role of the Gre factors in regulating the expression of Salmonella pathogenicity genes. The authors found that Gre factors are required for the proper expression of the Salmonella pathogenicity island (SPI) effector proteins and subsequent invasion of epithelial cells. They identified the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of the hilD gene as a regulatory motif that is responsible for Gre-mediated regulation of hilD expression. The Gre factors prevent backtracking of the RNA polymerase complex during transcription elongation, which in turn affects hilD expression. The authors propose that the 3'UTR of hilD acts as a reservoir for sRNAs that protect hilD transcripts from degradation. The study provides evidence for an additional mechanism of regulation of hilD expression at the post-transcriptional level, beyond transcriptional regulation. The results highlight the pivotal role of HilD in regulating S. Typhimurium pathogenicity, as its expression is tightly regulated and its activity is affected by multiple signaling pathways. The study provides new insights into the mechanism of Gre factor-mediated regulation of hilD expression and the 3'UTR as a regulatory motif.
This paper describes the genome and physiology of the bacterium H. arsenicoydans, which is capable of metabolizing arsenic acid. The genome consists of a single circular chromosome and lacks plasmids or megasomes, unlike other microbes isolated from natural environments. The genome contains genes for arsenic metabolism, as well as genes for detoxification, stress resistance, and motility. The bacterium is resistant to heavy metals like arsenic, cadmium, and zinc. The genome contains multiple arsenic metabolism operons and regulatory genes, and genes for energy metabolism, as well as genes for motility and EPS synthesis. The bacterium is capable of scavenging arsenic from the environment and has an adaptive response to its presence. The results suggest that microbes like H. arsenicoydans may have played a role in the colonization of arsenic-rich environments on Earth and may be useful in bioremediation of contaminated sites.
The paper investigates the associations between circulating phosphatidylcholine phospholipid fatty acids in early to midpregnancy and the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The authors measured plasma phospholipid fatty acids in a large cohort of low-risk pregnant women and found that primarily endogenously metabolized phosphatidylcholine fatty acids, such as gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), were positively associated with GDM risk, while primarily diet-derived phosphatidylcholine fatty acids, such as linoleic acid (LA), were not associated with GDM risk. The associations were found to vary by gestational window, with changes in phosphatidylcholine composition occurring over time. Specifically, GLA levels were higher and DHA levels lower in women who developed GDM compared to controls, while DLA levels were higher and DTA levels lower in controls. The authors suggest that the differential associations may indicate a role of circulating phosphatidylcholine fatty acids in GDM pathophysiology and highlight the importance of considering the subclasses of phosphatidylcholine fatty acids and their individual levels when assessing the effects of dietary fatty acids on glucose homeostasis and diabetes risk. The findings suggest that different phosphatidylcholine fatty acid subclasses may have distinct effects on glucose homeostasis and metabolism during pregnancy.
This paper proposes a model that describes how the presence of a latent HIV reservoir in infected cells can affect the evolution of the virus within an individual and the spread of the virus between individuals. The model shows that the latent reservoir can significantly delay the evolution of the virus within an individual, potentially leading to a shift towards intermediate levels of virulence that maximize transmission. The model incorporates a relative size of the latent reservoir compared to the number of actively infected cells. The authors find that the extent of this delay depends on the replication rate of the different strains, the activation rate of latently infected cells, and the size of the reservoir compared to the number of active infected cells. They show that a larger latent reservoir can lead to a larger delay in within-host evolution, potentially explaining why some individuals have low viral loads and low transmission rates. The model is then extended to study how the population level evolution of the virus is influenced by the latent reservoir. The authors find that the presence of the latent reservoir can result in the dominance of strains with intermediate virulence that maximize the population level reproduction number, even for strains that would be expected to be highly virulent in the absence of preferential transmission of ancestral virus. The study highlights the importance of considering the latent reservoir in understanding the evolutionary dynamics of HIV within and between hosts.
The paper describes the identification of a Schistosoma mansoni TGF-β ligand, SmInAct, which is expressed in both male and female Schistosoma mansoni parasites and plays a key role in egg development. The authors found that SmInAct is expressed at similar levels in both male and female parasites, but is undetectable in infertile females. They showed that knocking down SmInAct expression in female parasites leads to a failure to develop eggs, while knocking it down in male parasites does not have any noticeable effect. They also showed that eggs laid by SmInAct-knocked down females fail to develop. The authors propose that SmInAct is transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally regulated by the opposite sex and host immune system, and may play a role in transmitting a signal from the host immune response to the parasite. The identification of SmInAct as a TGF-β ligand in the parasite egg development pathway provides a new target for controlling schistosomiasis infection and could potentially lead to the development of new interventions.
The paper describes the discovery of two distinct centrosome structures in the apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoite. The tachyzoite centrosome has two replicating core complexes: an outer core containing factors TgCentrin1/TgSfi1 and TgSas-6, and an inner core containing TgCEP250/TgCEP25-L1. The outer core is aligned with the nuclear centrocone and controls the initiation of daughter budding, while the inner core is aligned with the centrocone and controls cytokinesis. The loss of the outer core in a temperature-sensitive mutant leads to a primary block in budding and the inner core amplifies and divides. This suggests that the outer and inner cores have different functions and are regulated by different mechanisms. The inner core replicates independently of the outer core and inherits the outer core proteins. The findings provide a framework to understand how apicomplexan parasites with multiple nuclei can adapt to different hosts and tissues by separating the functions of the outer and inner centrosome cores. The results suggest that differential regulation of centrosome core composition and/or activity could provide the flexibility required for apicomplexan parasites to adapt to multiple life cycles.
The paper describes a study on the regulatory mechanisms controlling development in the bacterium Streptomyces. The authors investigate how two response regulators, BldM and WhiI, work together to activate specific genes during development. They find that BldM and WhiI form a heterodimer that coactivates a subset of genes, called Group II genes, while BldM activates a different set of genes called Group I genes on its own. They use ChIP-seq and microarray analysis to identify direct binding sites for BldM and WhiI and demonstrate that BldM-WhiI heterodimer formation is required for the late stages of development. The results show that BldM and WhiI heterodimerization expands the signaling capabilities of bacterial cells beyond what can be achieved by individual response regulators.
This paper investigates the knowledge, attitudes and practices of local residents in an area in South Ethiopia where yellow fever (Yf) outbreaks have been repeatedly occurring since the 1960s. The study found that while most residents considered Yf a killer disease that affects all age groups, the majority of respondents had low levels of knowledge regarding its transmission and prevention methods. Only 41.9% of respondents believed that Yf can be transmitted from a patient to another person through mosquito bites, and 80% thought that mosquitoes that transmit malaria are different from those that transmit Yf. Most respondents believed that Yf can be transmitted through breathing. The study suggests that providing information on the role of mosquitoes in transmitting diseases and how to protect against mosquito bites could help improve awareness and increase vaccination coverage. However, the study had some limitations regarding generalizability and was not supplemented by qualitative data. The findings highlight the need for community-based strategies to improve knowledge and practices regarding Yf, particularly regarding its transmission and prevention.
This paper aims to investigate which immune responses are required for protection against yellow fever virus (YFV) vaccines, specifically the 17D-based vaccines that have been shown to be highly effective. The authors used a mouse model of YFV infection and disease to evaluate the immune response to 17D-204, a live-attenuated vaccine strain, and determine which immune constituents contribute to protection against a virulent wtYFV challenge. They found that both neutralizing antibodies and CD4+ T cells elicited by 17D-204 can be protective against challenge with a virulent wtYFV, while CD8+ T cells are not protective. 17D-204-specific CD4+ T cells were functional during the early and late time points following vaccination and produced IFNγ and a subset also produced combinations of TNFα and IL-2. Adoptively transferred 17D-204-specific CD4+ T cells contributed to survival following Ang71 challenge, suggesting that CD4+ T cells may functionally contribute to the superior efficacy of the 17D line of vaccines. The mechanism by which CD4+ T cells exert their effect remains unknown. The results suggest that 17D-204-elicited CD4+ T cells may be a critical component for effective vaccination against wtYFV. The study provides insights into the immune mechanisms that contribute to the superior efficacy of the 17D line of vaccines and may inform the development of vaccines against other flaviviruses.
The paper describes a community-based study in Zambia to determine the incidence of human cysticercosis caused by the larval stage of the pork tapeworm Taenia solium. The study found that about 38% of participants tested positive for circulating antibodies against cysticercos, indicating exposure to infection. However, only about half of participants remained negative throughout the study period, suggesting that many people were exposed but never fully established infection. About 32% of participants tested positive at some point during the study, but remained negative at the end. The higher levels of seroconversion compared to seroreversion suggest that many people had partial infections. The study found a sero-Ab incidence rate of 2360 per 10000 persons, comparable to previous studies in Peru and Ecuador. The high taenios prevalence suggests high environmental contamination and exposure risk. The findings suggest that people become infected due to high environmental contamination and a large number of exposures, with many infections never fully establishing, leading to transient antibody responses and possibly 'transient' antigen presence. The study highlights the dynamic nature of T. solium infections and the need to be cautious when interpreting serological results.
The paper explores how the number of MHC genes (genes that present pathogen-derived oligopeptides to T-cells) in an individual is influenced by the number of pathogens an individual encounters. The authors simulate interactions between MHC molecules and antigens produced by pathogens by matching strings of bits, with the model showing that under some conditions, high pathogen richness will increase the number of MHC genes in an individual, but only when the intrinsic cost of expressing more MHC genes is small. However, when the cost is higher, high pathogen richness does not result in the expected increase in MHC gene diversity. The model suggests that high pathogen richness is unlikely to explain the observed high MHC gene diversity observed among some bird species, as the intrinsic cost of expressing many MHC genes appears to be different in birds compared to mammals. The authors propose that the mechanism underlying the cost of expressing many MHC genes is not well understood, but may involve mechanisms such as deletion of self-reactive T-cells during negative selection in the thymus, increased risk of autoimmunity, or the necessity to reach a critical concentration of MHC-peptide ligands at the surface of antigen-presenting cells. The study suggests that interspecific differences in MHC gene diversity may be due to differences in the richness of parasites encountered by each species, although this association has been rarely examined. The model shows that high pathogen richness may select for more MHC genes, but is unlikely to explain the observed interspecific differences in MHC gene diversity, which can be modulated by the rate at which parasites evolve and the strength of mechanisms against high MHC gene diversity.
The paper derives analytical approximations for the sampling variance of the estimate of genetic variance and genetic correlation using genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data. These approximations are based on the idea that genetic relationships between unrelated individuals are very small, and the variance in genetic relatedness can be approximated by the inverse of the genetic relationship matrix. The approximations are derived for univariate and bivariate cases and can be applied to case-control studies. The sampling variance is found to depend on sample size, the proportion of variance explained by the genetic variants, and the correlation between the traits. The authors show through simulations that the approximations are consistent with observed standard errors from published studies and are able to accurately estimate the statistical power of detecting genetic associations. The approximations can be used to determine the sample size required to detect genetic associations with adequate precision. The authors also discuss how to modify the genetic relationship matrix to improve the accuracy of the estimate and how to handle cryptic relatedness in the data.
The paper describes a study that used NMR to investigate the mechanism by which a receptor-based switch regulates anthrax toxin prepore-to-pore conversion. The receptor-based switch is the anthrax toxin receptor (ANTXR2) which binds to the anthrax toxin protein. The anthraxin protein is composed of three independent polypeptide chains (receptor-binding (B), protective antigen (PA), and lethal factor (LF) and edema factor (EF). The anthraxin receptor type 2 (ANTXR2) is the most physiologically relevant receptor. The study showed that the anthraxin receptor type 2 (ANTXR2) remains bound to the PA domain 4 of the anthraxin protein after the prepore-to-pore conversion, which triggers the pore formation. The study used transferred cross-saturation (TCS) NMR experiments to monitor changes in the anthraxin receptor-protein interactions as a function of pH. The results showed that the anthraxin receptor contacts the PA domain 4 but contacts the PA domain 2 less strongly at acidic pH values, consistent with a model in which the receptor remains bound to PA domain 4 but contacts PA domain 2 are lost prior to prepore-to-pore conversion. The study found that the anthraxin receptor contacts remain bound to PA domain 4 after prepore-to-pore conversion at acidic pH values, consistent with a pore-stabilizing role for the receptor. The results provide evidence that the anthraxin receptor may influence the structure and function of the anthraxin pore.
The paper summarizes the results of a systematic review and meta-analysis of 24 studies that evaluated the yield of atrial fibrillation (AF) screening in different age strata, specifically people aged 65 years and older. The studies showed that the detection rate of new AF increases progressively with age, with the highest yield in the 70-74 age group, at 1.4% for people aged 75-79 years. Only 26% of new AF cases in people aged 65-74 years were eligible for guideline-based anticoagulation (OAC) compared to 84% in those aged 75 years or older. The number needed to screen (NNS) to identify one new AF case also increases with age, from 21 for people aged 65-69 to 1,089 for those aged 60-64 years. The authors conclude that screening for AF in a general population aged 65 years or older is likely to be cost-effective, based on the yield and stroke risk profile, but actual cost-effectiveness will depend on the age distribution of the population to be screened. The yield and NNS are sensitive to age, so precise estimates are needed for different age cutoffs for screening. However, actual cost-effectiveness will also depend on the age distribution of the population and the number of strokes prevented.
The paper investigates the role of the HLA-E molecule Qa-1 in mediating immune responses to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. The authors find that Qa-1 can present MTB peptides to CD8+ T cells and provide protection against high-dose MTB infection by regulating T cell responses. Qa-1-deficient mice have increased bacterial burden and mortality compared to Qa-1+ mice, indicating that Qa-1 is necessary for protection. The authors identify two mechanisms by which Qa-1 provides protection: 1) through presentation of MTB peptides to CD8+ T cells and 2) through regulation of T cell responses. They use genetically modified mice deficient in Qa-1-restricted CD8+ Tregs or inhibitory NKG2A interaction to demonstrate that both mechanisms are involved. The results suggest that MTB-specific Qa-1-restricted CD8+ T effector cells could have both cytolytic and regulatory functions, and may be useful targets for vaccine development. The study provides insights into the diverse immunological functions of HLA-E molecules in MTB infection and informs future studies on HLA-E-restricted CD8+ T cell responses.
This paper investigates the within-host dynamics of plant viruses and how they evolve within plant hosts. The researchers used high-throughput sequencing to track the evolution of four virus variants of Potato virus Y (PVY) within pepper plants. They found that the virus populations exhibited genetic drift and natural selection, with some variants being favored and others counter-selected by the host. The frequency of the variants changed over time, with some variants becoming dominant while others became less common. The researchers used statistical models to infer the competition coefficients between the variants and the intensity of genetic drift experienced by the viruses during plant colonization. They found that the fitness of the variants determined their ability to compete with each other, and that the genetic drift was strongest early in plant colonization and decreased later. The results showed that the scarcity of variants able to overcome a resistance gene was consistent with the evolutionary pathway observed. Overall, the study demonstrated how mathematical models can accurately describe both selection and genetic drift shaping the evolutionary dynamics of viruses within hosts, providing insights into how they emerge and how they can be controlled.
The paper describes the discovery of a gene duplication in the Staphylocococcus lugdunensis strain HKU09-01 that leads to increased expression of the isd gene, which encodes a heme acquisition system. The isd gene allows the bacteria to acquire heme from hemoglobin as a source of iron, which is limiting in the human body. The duplication was found to confer an advantage to the bacteria under iron-limiting conditions, allowing it to outcompete other strains when heme is present. This was shown by comparing growth rates and hemoglobin binding in iron-restricted medium with or human serum. The study found that the duplication resulted in an increase in the copy number of the isd gene, which correlated with the amount of protein present. This suggests that the gene amplification of the isd gene provides an advantage when competing for heme in the human body, which is consistent with the bacteria's nutritional immunity mechanism. However, the duplication had no advantage under iron-saturated conditions. The work suggests that gene amplification of virulence factors may represent a double-edged sword, providing an evolutionary advantage only if selective pressure is maintained.
This paper presents new data on the spread of two Wolbachia infections in Drosophila simulans populations along the eastern coast of Australia. The authors find that the Wolbachia infections, wAu and wRi, spread in a Fisherian manner, increasing in frequency over time and displacing the original wAu infection. They infer that wRi increases host fitness even more than wAu, which explains the rapid spread of wRi. The wAu infection was found to have little or no reproductive manipulation and did not cause CI, while wRi caused significant CI. The data suggest that the wRi infection entered Australian populations within the last few decades, likely through human-mediated introduction. The authors propose a simple model to explain the spread of wRi, which shows that wRi increases in frequency only when very rare, consistent with the observed rapid spread of wRi across eastern Australia. The paper supports the idea that Wolbachia infections that provide little or no reproductive manipulation can spread deterministically from low initial frequencies, while those that induce CI spread in a bistable manner.
This paper provides an assessment of the epidemiology and geographic distribution of cholera in the Philippines. The authors analyzed data from 2008-2013 to determine the incidence of suspected and confirmed cholera cases in the country, which was found to be 9.1 cases per 10,000 population. They found that access to improved sanitation was associated with lower cholera incidence, while access to improved water sources was associated with higher cholera incidence. This suggests that breakdowns in water systems may lead to residents using contaminated sources. The paper concludes that the findings highlight the importance of maintaining water infrastructure and improving cholera surveillance to better define the burden of the disease and support policies to minimize morbidity and mortality.
The paper identifies a new gene-diet pair that controls the plasticity of aging in Caenorhabditis elegans. The gene flr-4 regulates the expression of cytoprotective genes in response to different bacterial diets, and this is mediated by the p38 MAPK pathway. The mutant flr-4(n259) has increased life span when fed the bacteria strain HT15 but not OP50, indicating that it is able to prevent the activation of the p38 MAPK pathway specific to different diets. The study shows that flr-4 mutants have delayed reproductive span and lower brood size compared to wild-type, which suggests that the gene regulates adaptive capacity to diet. The paper finds that flr-4 uses a p38 MAPK pathway similar to that of the eat-2 model of dietary restriction to ensure longevity, but independent of the FOXO factors DAF-16 and FOXA. The study also shows that flr-4 regulates life span in the intestine and neurons, and that knocking down the gene in these tissues is sufficient to extend life span. The paper suggests that the intestine may play an important role in sensing different diet that is ingested, but the exact mechanism remains to be answered. Overall, the study identifies a novel gene-diet pair that controls the adaptive capacity to food quality and suggests that organisms have evolved cellular modules that evaluate both quality and quantity of diet to regulate life span.
The paper describes a corpus of 15 million full-text scientific articles from publishers like Springer and Elsevier, and compares the performance of text mining of full-text articles versus abstracts in extracting protein-protein associations, disease-gene associations, and protein-compartment associations. The authors found that full-text articles outperform abstracts in extracting these types of associations, with the biggest gain being in finding disease-gene associations. They used a Named Entity Recognition system to quantitatively benchmark the performance. The full-text corpus outperformed the MEDLINE abstract corpus in all benchmarked cases except for protein-compartment associations. The authors conclude that full-text articles provide valuable information that cannot be found in abstracts and that as more full-text articles become available, text mining methods will improve. However, the performance gain is likely to diminish as more full-text articles are added. The study demonstrates the importance of full-text articles for extracting relevant information in systems biology.
The paper describes an experimental evolution approach to investigate the evolution of Legionella pneumophila within mouse macrophages. L. pneumophila is a broadly host-range bacterium that can cause Legionnaires' disease in humans, but little is known about its evolution within mammalian hosts. The researchers passaged L. pneumophila within mouse macrophages for hundreds of generations, isolating mutations that improved its fitness within these cells. They identified mutations in genes involved in flagellar regulation, lysine biosynthesis, and the Dot/Icm translocation system, which resulted in lysine auxotrophy. The mutations that improved intracellular replication within macrophages were found to have fitness costs in other hosts. The results suggest that cycling through diverse protozoan hosts maintains L. pneumophila as a generalist, with environmental selection favoring genetic redundancy and adaptability. The study shows that rapid parallel evolution of L. pneumophila within macrophages can reveal important selective pressures that influence its evolution within mammalian hosts, which will be critical for understanding the epidemiology of human outbreaks of the bacteria.
The paper discusses the feasibility and acceptability of conducting a home-based survey on sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among adolescents and young adults in a rural African setting using a demographic surveillance system. The study was conducted in a rural area in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa and found that it was possible to collect samples from 47 of the 134 eligible participants, with 96% of women and 93% of men providing vaginal swabs and blood samples. Participants found it easy to collect samples and felt comfortable and relaxed during the process. The survey found high prevalence of chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis and trichomoniasis among both men and women, with young people aged 20-24 years having more than twice the odds of having a curable STI compared to those aged 15-19. HSV-2 was more common among young women and BV was found in 40% of women. Factors associated with curable STIs included higher number of sexual partners and reporting sexual debut. The study demonstrates that home-based surveys can provide population-based representative prevalence estimates of STIs, but more research is needed to validate self-reported sexual behaviors and underreporting. The paper highlights the potential of nesting STI surveys within demographic surveillance systems to obtain robust prevalence estimates and inform strategies to address both HIV and STIs.
The paper describes a mouse model that was used to study the role of developmental timing in the generation of new neurons in the hippocampus. The model used a transgenic mouse that expressed a gene called PC3, which caused the premature differentiation of type-1 progenitor cells in the dentate gyrus. This resulted in a reduction in the number of newborn neurons and a decrease in the ability of the dentate gyrus to integrate new synaptic transmission. The authors found that the number of new neurons generated was not affected, but the speed at which the neurons matured was. The faster maturation of the new neurons impaired the ability of the dentate gyrus to learn new spatial memories, as measured by behavioral tests. The authors suggest that the premature maturation of newborn neurons may provide a unique opportunity to study the role of developmental timing in the generation of functional neurons.
The paper proposes a model of how honeybees estimate their angular velocity (AV) based on the response of their visual system. The model suggests that the AV estimation is performed by combining the outputs of Reichardt-Hassen detectors (RHD) with different time delays in a columnar manner, rather than through a separate retinotopic circuit. This approach allows for a more efficient use of existing neural resources, as the same information is used by both the optomotor response and AV estimation systems. The RHDs are tuned to respond to different spatial frequencies, and the outputs are combined to estimate the AV. The model is validated by comparing its performance to behavioral data, which shows it can reproduce the deviations in flight path and odometry that bees exhibit when presented with different spatial frequencies of gratings. The authors argue that this columnar approach is more conservative from an evolutionary perspective, as it leverages existing neural structures and reduces metabolic cost, even though it may not provide as accurate AV estimation as a dedicated circuit.
This paper describes a study on the function of the gene PHD1 in rice, which encodes a novel UDP-Glc epimerase involved in the biosynthesis of galactolipids in chloroplasts. The gene PHD1 was found to be localized in rice chloroplasts and encoded a protein with a putative transmembrane domain. Mutations in PHD1 led to reduced galactolipid biosynthesis and impaired photosynthesis, resulting in stunted growth and reduced biomass production. Overexpression of PHD1 in rice led to increased photosynthetic efficiency and improved biomass production. The study found that PHD1 acts as a UDP-Glc epimerase in situ in chloroplasts, generating UDP-Gal for galactolipid biosynthesis, which is then converted to MGDG. The results suggest that the stunted growth phenotype of phd1 mutants is due to insufficient galactolipid supply for chloroplast proliferation, leading to reduced photosynthetic efficiency. The study also found that PHD1 overexpression increased MGDG levels and photosynthetic efficiency, indicating a key role for PHD1 in the photosynthetic system of rice. The findings have significant implications for crop improvement and bioenergy crop production.
The paper investigates the role of the dilp gene family of insulin-like peptide ligands in Drosophila melanogaster. The dilp genes encode for insulin-like peptides that act as ligands for the insulin receptor and play a role in regulating development, metabolism, reproduction and lifespan. The authors generated mutants with specific deletion or duplication of the dilp genes and found that most dilp genes have remained conserved across different species of Drosophila, indicating that redundant copies may have evolved to provide stability. The mutants showed different phenotypes, suggesting that the different dilps have different functions. The dilp2 gene was found to be particularly important for growth during larval development, while the dilp6 gene was expressed specifically in the fat body and controlled growth during pupal development. The dilp4 gene was found to have little function, while the dilp7 gene was the only one with orthologs outside Drosophila. The dilp2-3-5 mutants showed a delay in development and growth, indicating that these genes are redundant in controlling these processes. The dilp2-5 mutants were long-lived, indicating that DILP2-5 acts redundantly. The dilp6 mutants were long-lived and had increased trehalose levels, suggesting that DILP6 acts in the fat body to regulate growth and lipid storage. The Wolbachia bacteria, which is maternally transmitted, was found to extend the lifespan of the dilp2-3 mutants. The authors propose that redundant DILP copies may help Drosophila adapt to different nutritional conditions by downplaying stochastic variations in expression or secretion.
The paper describes a method to identify transcription factors that are associated with breast cancer patient survival by analyzing DNA methylation patterns. The authors used DNA methylation data from primary breast tumor samples to identify CpG sites that were significantly correlated with patient survival time and then determined which TF binding sites were enriched in DNA regions surrounding those survival-associated CpGs. They found that many ERα TF binding motifs were significantly enriched in hypomethylated CpG regions of ER- breast cancer samples, while p53 TF binding motifs were enriched in hypermethylated CpG regions of p53- breast cancer samples. This suggests that the activity of these transcription factors is associated with methylation levels. The authors then validated their findings using an independent DNA methylation dataset and found that many of the identified TF binding motifs were also differentially expressed at the mRNA level. The results indicate that TF binding motifs may be a useful predictor of breast cancer patient survival, with the majority of ERα and p53 TF binding motifs being enriched in survival-associated CpGs. The authors propose a model where the activity of key TFs is initially blocked by methylation and then becomes accessible to alternative factors once the TF is inactivated, leading to gene misregulation and cancer progression. The study demonstrates that DNA methylation and TF binding motifs can provide valuable insights into breast cancer transcriptional regulation and patient prognosis.
The paper discusses the evolutionary conservation of Polycomb group proteins (PcGs) in plants and animals. PcGs regulate gene expression by establishing and maintaining epigenetic modifications around target genes. The authors investigate how the specificity of PcGs is established through functional redundancy and diversity of PcG components. They use genome-wide sequencing data to compare genome-wide changes in H3K27me3 and gene expression profiles in loss-of-function mutants of PRC1 (AtBMI1, AtRING1 and LHP1) and PRC2 (CLF) components in Arabidopsis seedlings. They find that different combinations of PcGs have distinct target genes and are associated with different transcription factor binding motifs. The binding of MADS box transcription factors is closely associated with H3K27me3 peaks regulated by CLF and LHP1, suggesting a mechanism by which PcGs are modulated by tissue-specific transcription factors. The authors propose a context-dependent model where PcGs employ multiple protein families and have specialized functions. The common targets may represent ancient processes, while unique features may have evolved more recently. The findings provide insights into how epigenetic machineries cooperate with transcription factors to fine-tune developmental regulation. The study highlights the importance of quantitative analysis of genome-wide data and the need for further exploration of the relationship between cis-elements, TFs and PcGs in specific regulation of developmental processes.
The paper describes an improved genetic linkage map of the Aedes aegypti mosquito, a vector of important arboviruses like dengue and chikungunya. The current genome assembly of the mosquito contains 478 scaffolds that are not fully organized and oriented across chromosomes. The authors used Restricted-site Associated DNA (RAD) sequencing to assign 58% of the genome onto chromosomal scaffolds, including 53 scaffolds not previously included in the most recent map. They found that 14% of the scaffolds are misassembled, resulting in 63 scaffolds being split into multiple pieces. They corrected misassemblies by splitting the scaffolds. The map consists of 2006 markers and places 58% of the genome onto chromosomes, including 60% of annotated genes. They found that misassemblies correspond to breaks in synteny between the Aedes and Anopheles gambiae genomes, suggesting that synteny can be used to correct the Aedes genome assembly. They also found that Aedes has low recombination rates across all three chromosomes, with reduced rates near the centromeres. They used the map to map resistance to the filarial nematode Brugia malayi and confirmed the location on the first chromosome. The study demonstrates the importance of a well-organized genome for studying mosquito-parasite interactions and genetic control of disease transmission.
The paper describes a comprehensive genetic analysis of the mecillinam resistome of Escherichia coli. Using Tn-Seq, they simultaneously mapped nearly all loci in the genome where gene disruption by transposon insertion promotes survival upon mecillinam challenge. They performed the analysis in genetic backgrounds defective for stress responses known to confer mecillinam resistance when they are induced, identifying stress response-dependent and stress response-independent loci. They found that stress response-dependent loci are associated with inducing ppGpp production or constitutive expression of the Rcs response, while stress-independent loci are associated with cell wall biogenesis components like Rod system and cell wall cleaving enzymes. They identified a novel mechanism by which endopeptidase activity stimulates aBP synthesis by the aPBPs. Specifically, they found that overproduction of endopeptidases like MepS can stimulate aPBP activity and PG synthesis, by redirecting precursors away from the mecillinam-targeted Rod complex. They propose that endopeptides may couple cell wall synthesis with space-making enzymes through the regulation of aPBP activity by their cognate outer membrane lipoproteins. Their findings support an alternative model that endopeptides can stimulate PG synthase function without direct protein-protein interaction. The results provide new insights into cell wall biogenesis and may help guide the development of new antibiotics that target the process.
The paper investigates how short-term synaptic plasticity, specifically asynchronous release of neurotransmitter from presynaptic terminals, affects neuronal gain control. The authors use a computational model to show that in the low membrane conductance regime, asynchronous release acts to amplify the gain of the neuron, while in the high conductance regime, it acts to reduce the gain. The ability of asynchronous release to modulate gain depends on the level of shunting inhibition. The authors also show that correlated afferent inputs can affect the output firing rate, and the effect of asynchronous release on gain modulation depends on the membrane conductance and the type of synaptic transmission. They argue that local dendritic modulation of membrane conductance could potentially widen the range over which asynchronous release affects gain modulation in real pyramidal neurons. They propose that the ability of pyramidal neurons to control gain through asynchronous release could provide significant computational capacity. The paper provides insights into the principles of computation at the single cell level and offers avenues for future experiments to test their conclusions.
This paper describes the discovery of a new mechanism for mitigating protein misfolding and aggregation associated with neurodegenerative diseases. The authors identified a C. elegans model of ALS linked to a human SOD1 mutation and used a genetic screen to isolate suppressor mutations that significantly reduced the neurodegenerative phenotype. They found that the suppressor mutations were caused by two conserved genes, ufd-2 and spr-5, which encode a ubiquitin ligase and lysine-specific demethylase, respectively. Inactivation of these genes in C. elegans, Drosophila, and mammalian cells was found to increase the clearance of misfolded proteins, suppressing the neurodegeneration associated with the SOD1 mutation. The authors showed that the suppressor mutations required the transcription factor p53, which was activated by the inactivation of the ubiquitin ligase and demethylase. The results suggest that p53 acts as a transcriptional switch that can be reprogrammed to protect against proteotoxicity through transcriptional regulation. The identification of a novel pathway that mitigates the toxicity of misfolded proteins provides a potential therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases.
The paper proposes a new method called DynaFace to classify protein-protein interfaces into obligatory and non-obligatory types based on the dynamic fluctuations of the interacting subunits. The method uses the Gaussian Network Model (GNM) to calculate the correlation between residue fluctuations in different modes of motion in the structure. The authors find that even using only the two slowest modes of fluctuation can yield significant success rates for predicting the interface type, and that combining all modes yields higher accuracy. However, there is a continuous spectrum of dynamic behaviors from non-obligatory to obligatory interactions, and the thresholds used are arbitrary. The method is able to differentiate between obligatory and non-obligatory interfaces based on the dynamic footprints of the complexes. The authors validate the method on a dataset of protein-protein complexes and compare it to other approaches. They find that DynaFace outperforms other methods in predicting the interface types of complexes with multiple chains. The method could be useful for predicting the functional mechanisms of protein complexes and designing and modifying proteins.
This paper compares and contrasts the genetic requirements for conventional and pheromone-stimulated biofilms formed by Candida albicans, a prevalent pathogen that colonizes and infects multiple niches in humans. The authors find that the transcription factor Cph1 (ortholog of S. cerevisiae Ste12) is the master regulator of pheromone signaling in C. albicans, as deletion of this gene abolished both pheromone-stimulated biofilms by white cells and sexual mating by opaque cells. This result was surprising, as previous reports had indicated that Cph1 was critical for the opaque response to pheromone but dispensable for the white response. They propose a new model in which the same MAP kinase components and Cph1 transcription factor are responsible for signal transduction in both white and opaque cells. Transcriptional profiling was used to identify factors that act downstream of Cph1, and six genes were identified that are pheromone-induced in wildtype white cells under biofilm conditions but are not induced in either tec1 or cph1 mutants. These genes included Hgc1, which is important for biofilm formation. The authors conclude that Cph1 mediates the pheromone response in both white and opaque cells, while Tec1 has a more general effect on biofilm formation. Differences in cell wall morphology and adhesion likely contribute to the distinct phenotypes observed upon pheromone challenge. The white-opaque switch has been described in related species, and studies comparing responses in these species may shed light on the mechanisms of pheromone signaling in C. albicans.
This paper presents a study that aims to gain insights into the mechanisms that underlie the topological organization of human brain networks by comparing empirical brain network data with synthetic network models. The authors begin by constructing a series of synthetic network models with varying levels of complexity, from random and regular to embedded models, and compare them to empirical brain data. They find that embedded models that incorporate spatial constraints are more similar to the brain data than non-embedded models. They argue that this suggests that physical constraints likely play an important role in determining the topological properties of brain networks, in contrast to a single topological variable being selected by evolutionary drivers. The results suggest that more complex models that account for both physical constraints and growth processes over time will be needed to fully capture brain network structure. The paper provides a battery of synthetic network models that can be used for statistical inference, as well as insights into the biological mechanisms driving brain network development and organization. The authors acknowledge limitations of their work, including the focus on binary topology and the focus on node degree and connectivity rather than node properties. The study demonstrates the potential of using synthetic network models to gain mechanistic insights into brain network organization, but highlights the need for more complicated models that account for node properties.
This paper investigates the role of the UBF gene in regulating rRNA gene transcription and ribosome biogenesis in mammalian cells. The authors use conditional UBF gene inactivation in mice to show that UBF is essential for rRNA gene activity and for the formation of the pre-initiation complex. UBF depletion causes large-scale changes in rRNA gene chromatin, consistent with a transition from the active state to a potentially active resting state, but not heterochromatinization. Unexpectedly, inactivation of rRNA gene activity does not significantly affect the hundreds of RPII and RPIII genes implicated in ribosome biogenesis, suggesting that rRNA gene activity does not coordinate the gene expression required for ribosome assembly. Instead, UBF recruits nucleolar proteins to the rDNA. Conditional inactivation of UBF causes nucleolar proteins to coalesce into dense nuclear bodies, while the rDNA disperses into nuclear foci. These findings suggest that UBF plays a key role in transitioning rRNA genes between an active and potentially active state. The nucleolar bodies are likely related to the nucleolar precursor bodies found in pre-implantation embryos and may play important roles during cell division. The results provide new insights into the mechanism of rRNA gene regulation and ribosome biogenesis.
The paper discusses how trypanosomes, a group of parasites that have a unique life cycle involving multiple hosts and long periods of growth in non-selective environments, have evolved genes that are dual-coding, meaning they contain information for two different proteins. The authors argue that this is an adaptation to protect against genetic drift during extended periods of growth. They found that many extensively edited genes in the mitochondria of trypanosomes, including CR3 and ND7, contain alternative reading frames that allow access to both reading frames. This is detected by identifying gRNAs that can introduce different stop codons at the 5' end of the gene, which determine which reading frame is used. They also found that the mutation patterns of these dual-coding genes are different from other edited genes, indicating an additional layer of mutational constraint beyond the RNA editing process. The authors propose that the dual-coding genes provide a selective advantage by shielding essential genes from deleterious mutations in critical electron transport chain genes, allowing the parasites to survive extended periods of growth in the mammal host. They suggest that the complex RNA editing system may provide multiple strategies to increase genetic robustness and protect against genetic drift, complementing the fragmentation of genes throughout the genome.
The paper describes a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of age at menarche (AAM) in a cohort of 47 Caucasian women. The study identified a novel gene, SPOCK, with multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with AAM variation at genome-wide significance level (FDR q<0.05). The GWAS and replication studies found consistent associations between the SPOCK gene and AAM in both Caucasian and Chinese cohorts. The SPOCK gene is a proteoglycan that inhibits matrix metalloproteinase-2 activation, which is involved in cyclic endometrial breakdown and menstrual onset. The study suggests that SPOCK may play an essential role in regulating age at menarche through its inhibition of MMP-2. However, the mechanism is speculative and needs functional studies to be fully validated. The study highlights the potential of GWAS for identifying novel genes for complex traits like AAM and demonstrates the power of high-density SNP genotyping platforms. The small sample size and limitations of self-reported AAM data are noted as potential limitations. Future studies will focus on larger GWAS to identify more genes, share data with other researchers, and perform functional studies on the SPOCK gene to better understand its role in AAM regulation.
The paper investigated the role of cathepsin B in regulating cytokine expression in response to Leishmania major infection in vitro. Cathepsin B-deficient bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDC) and macrophages (BMM) were generated from mice lacking cathepsin B. Compared to wild type BMDC and BMM, cathepsin B-deficient cells showed higher levels of MHC class II molecules and IL-12 expression in response to Leishmania promastigotes, indicating a "pro-Th1"-like profile. The authors suggest that cathepsin B may regulate cytokine expression in response to Leishmania infection by interacting directly with virulence factors, silencing signaling pathways, or affecting intermediate signaling pathways. The results suggest that inhibition of cathepsin B may improve the Th1-mediated clearance of Leishmania. The study provides evidence for a novel role of cathepsin B as a regulator of cytokine expression during Leishmania infection and opens up avenues for exploring its potential as a therapeutic target.
This paper investigates the effect of teaching genetics before evolution on students' understanding and acceptance of evolution. The authors randomly assigned some schools to teach genetics before evolution and others to teach evolution before genetics. They found that students who were taught genetics first had significantly higher understanding and acceptance of evolution compared to those taught evolution first. This effect was observed in both higher and lower ability students. The authors suggest that teaching genetics first may help reduce cognitive biases and conceptual priming that can hinder acceptance of evolution. The findings suggest that teaching genetics first may be a simple, cost-free way to improve evolution understanding and acceptance, especially among lower ability students. However, the study has limitations due to randomization constraints and potential teacher effects. The authors recommend that teaching genetics first may be a useful strategy to improve evolution understanding, especially among lower ability students, but more research is needed to understand how to tailor teaching to ability.
This paper investigates how different hosts (birds) influence the evolution of the West Nile virus (WNV) through intrahost dynamics. The study found that birds with different levels of susceptibility to WNV infection have distinct impacts on the virus population structure and fitness. WNV replicated in disease-resistant birds (robins) resulted in more amino acid substitutions that reach high frequency compared to replication in less resistant birds (crows). The ancestral haplotype was displaced by novel mutants that arose during passage in susceptible birds. Passage in robins resulted in more genetic diversity and fitness gains, while passage in crows resulted in limited fitness gains and more defective genomes. The results suggest that disease-resistant birds like robins may be more likely to drive virus evolution and maintain high fitness within intrahost populations, while mosquitoes are more efficient at generating mutational diversity. The study provides insights into how host resistance and susceptibility influence WNV evolution and transmission.
This paper investigated the connections between driver gene mutations and DNA methylation patterns in different types of cancer. They found that driver genes are tightly associated with DNAm alterations in cancer, and driver gene mutations are associated with specific DNAm patterns that are reproducibly seen across multiple cancer types. For example, TP53 mutations are associated with hypomethylation, while BRAF mutations are associated with hypermethylation. They identified driver genes that are associated with CGI hypermethylation and open sea hypomethylation in multiple cancer types. They also found that driver genes associated with CGI hypermethylation are enriched in regulatory gene sets related to cell cycle and signaling pathways, while driver genes associated with hypomethylation are enriched in pathways related to amino acid metabolism. They also found that the methylation patterns associated with driver genes shape gene expression profiles. Their findings suggest that the mutational and epigenetic landscapes in cancer are closely interdependent and that driver genes and DNAm alterations may affect important regulatory networks related to oncogenesis. The study demonstrates the potential of using DNAm patterns to identify molecular subtypes of cancer and to aid treatment selection.
This paper studies the histopathological and immunohistochemical characteristics of the mucosal vasculature surrounding Schistosoma haematobium ova in the female genital tract of Malawian and Norwegian women. The study found that the periovular tissue of the infected women was significantly more vascularized than the non-endemic controls, with a higher density of established blood vessels and capillary buds. Viable ova were more often found in granulation tissue rich in sprouting blood vessels compared to calcified ova. There was no association between calcified ova and fibrosis. The study suggests that the increased vascularity of the mucosa may provide a point of entry for HIV transmission, supporting the theory that genital schistosomiasis may increase the risk of HIV infection. However, the study had limitations such as small sample size, potential for false negatives, and uncontrolled confounding variables. Further studies are needed to validate the findings and explore the clinical correlates of the various histopathological manifestations in female genital schistosomias.
The paper proposes a method called E-Flux to predict metabolic capacity based on gene expression data. E-Flux extends flux balance analysis by incorporating gene expression data to model the maximum flux through metabolic reactions. The method uses expression data to model the maximum flux through each reaction, and applies constraints from gene expression to flux balance analysis. E-Flux can predict the impact of drugs, environmental conditions, and gene knockouts on metabolic network capabilities. The method was applied to predict the impact of drugs and environmental conditions on mycolic acid production in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. E-Flux correctly predicted seven of eight known inhibitors of mycolic acid biosynthesis, and also predicted new inhibitors. The key advantage of E-Flux is that it does not assume that all reactions have the same maximum capacity, but rather uses gene expression data to model the maximum flux. This allows it to predict more biologically realistic behavior and identify different mechanisms of action. The method has potential applications beyond Mycobacterium tuberculosis and could be used to study other disease states where expression data is available.
The paper describes the structure and function of a type II secretion system (T2SS) pilotin protein called OutS. The pilotin binds tightly to the extreme C-terminus of the secretin subunit of the T2SS and causes the unstructured region to become helical, which facilitates the secretin's proper assembly in the outer membrane. The pilotin structure is different from that of a type III secretion system (T3SS) pilotin, with an open β-barrel structure. The pilotin structure was determined using X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy. The pilotin binds the secretin peptide in a 1∶1 stoichiometric ratio, with 12 residues of the secretin peptide becoming helical on binding. The binding of the secretin peptide to the pilotin was shown to be tight with a dissociation constant of around 50 nM. Deletion of the extreme C-terminus of the secretin subunit resulted in mislocalization of the secretin to the inner membrane, indicating the importance of this region for targeting. The pilotin structure was found to be different from that of the T3SS pilotin, which binds the secretin C-terminus and causes the secretin to form a 4-helix bundle. The differences in pilotin structure highlight the evolutionary independence of these proteins to play similar roles in different secretion systems.
This paper proposes a new model that combines chemical reactions and mechanical forces to explain cell polarity. The model incorporates membrane tension as a key factor that affects the polarization of cells. The model uses a phase field approach to distinguish the interior of the cell from the exterior, allowing for the Rac-GTP and Rac-GDP molecules to be located on the cell membrane and cytosol. The model shows that membrane tension affects the sensitivity and persistence of cell polarization, with cells that have lower membrane tension being more sensitive and persistent. The model is able to recapitulate several experimental results, including the aspiration-release experiment and the pseudopod-neck-body severing experiment, which previous models could not. The authors show that cells with lower membrane tension have a higher tendency to polarize and exhibit more spontaneous polarization, consistent with experimental measurements. The model also shows that membrane tension affects the spatial profile of cell polarity and sensitivity to external stimuli, leading to more stable and robust polarization. The authors conclude that understanding the coupling between chemical reactions and mechanical forces is crucial to fully understand cell polarity.
This paper proposes a neural mass model of coupled cortical macrocolumns that can exhibit excitation-inhibition segregation at the mesoscopic level. The model uses a mean field approximation to represent the average activity of three interacting cortical populations: excitatory and inhibitory interneurons and pyramidal cells. The model shows that even when the nodes are identical and receive the same driving input, their activity can be segregated into two different modes: predominantly excitatory or predominantly inhibitory. This segregation arises due to the heterogeneous connectivity, specific excitatory-inhibitory couplings and external excitatory input to all nodes. The authors find that this segregation emerges for networks with inhomogeneous degree distribution, and is dependent on the topological features of the network. They show that the degree of segregation depends on the inter-columnar coupling strengths α and β. The results suggest that organization of excitation and inhibition at the mesoscopic level may contribute to cooperative information processing in the brain, by allowing nodes to explore a wider range of activity states without necessarily losing their capacity to evolve irregularly in a synchronized way with the rest of the network.
The paper discusses the evolutionary origins of effector proteins that are translocated by bacterial pathogens into eukaryotic cells to subvert host cellular processes. The authors find that effector proteins often have a modular architecture consisting of a secretion signal and a functional domain. They show that effector proteins encoded on conjugative plasmids can also be secreted as interbacterial effectors during conjugation, suggesting that the acquisition of effectors from genuine bacterial proteins through interbacterial secretion systems may be an important evolutionary missing link in the origin of host-targeted effectors. The authors find that the Vbh T4SS of Bartonella encodes the interbacterial effector protein VbhTxin, which is secreted alongside conjugative plasmid transfer. They identify additional examples of TA module toxins that have evolved into substrates of interbacterial type IV secretion alongside conjugative plasmid transfer. They propose that interbacterial effectors may represent an evolutionary missing link between genuine bacterial proteins and host-targeted effectors, allowing for the acquisition of effectors through interbacterial secretion systems and then adaptation for host interaction. This transition may have happened directly or through an intermediate step in which a conjugative T4SS manipulates host cell surface structures without effector secretion. The study highlights the potential role of interbacterial secretion systems in the evolution of host-targeted secretion systems and effectors, and the Bartonella genus as a useful model system to unravel the evolutionary history of these effectors.
The paper investigated the presence of vector-borne pathogens in dogs and ticks in Nigeria. Blood samples from 181 dogs and ticks from 4 states in Nigeria were collected and analyzed for the presence of 10 vector-borne pathogens using molecular techniques. The study found that 7.3% of dogs were infected with vector-borne pathogens, with 40% of the infections being single infections and 67% being co-infections. The most common pathogens detected were Babesia canis, Ehrlichia canis, Rickettsia spp., and Hepatozoon canis. The study also detected several new vector-borne pathogens in Nigeria, including Candidatus N. mikurensis, Rickettsia conorii israelensis, Anaplasma platys and Theileria sp. The study showed a significant association between the detection of H. canis DNA in dogs and ticks removed from the same dog, indicating that ticks may be transmitting the pathogen to their current host. The findings suggest that dogs are competent reservoirs for several vector-borne pathogens and ticks are important vectors for these pathogens in Nigeria. Further investigation is required to determine the role of these pathogens in causing diseases in humans and to inform public health policy.
This paper presents a computational model that simulates the activation of thin filaments in skeletal muscle. The model includes kinetic and mechanical forms of cooperativity that affect force production during contraction. The model shows how the number of activated regulatory units (RUs) along a thin filament can influence the Ca2+ sensitivity and cooperativity of force production. The model also shows that the stiffness of thin and thick filaments affects the cooperativity of force production, with thicker filaments reducing force production. The authors find that a combination of kinetic and mechanical forms of cooperativity can produce the highest cooperativity. The results suggest that cooperative forces are more sensitive to RU activation than XB binding, and that XB binding can maintain and augment thin filament activation. The model provides insights into how spatial and mechanical properties of the contractile lattice influence cooperative filament activation and force development. The findings agree with previous experimental measurements and suggest that cooperative forces arise from multiple mechanisms that work together at the molecular level.
This paper proposes a new method called CERAMIC for genetic association mapping of binary traits in samples that include related individuals. The method combines elements of logistic regression and linear mixed models to model the effects of covariates on the binary trait, while also accounting for missing data. It uses a retrospective approach to assess significance of the test statistic, which allows it to incorporate partially missing data and is robust to misspecification of the phenotype model. In simulations, CERAMIC is shown to outperform previous methods that do not handle missing data, particularly those that use a linear mean structure. When covariates play a major role in the model, methods that include an additive polygenic effect tend to have higher power. The CERAMIC method is able to recover a large portion of the power of complete data when partially missing data is present among related individuals, while methods that impute the mean genotype value for missing genotypes perform poorly. The paper applies the CERAMIC method to analyze type 2 diabetes data from the Framingham Heart Study, replicating known associations with two previously identified loci and identifying new loci with strong associations.
The paper describes a study on the function of the accessory protein Vpx from primate lentiviruses, specifically how it antagonizes an antiviral restriction in macrophages. Vpx is a virion protein that is packaged into the virion and is required for macrophage infection. The study shows that Vpx is essential for macrophage infection by SIV and HIV-2/VSM, but not for infection of COS cells. Vpx antagonizes an antiviral restriction in macrophages that is counteracted by the proteasome/ubiquitin system. Vpx ubiquitination is required for its activity, but the exact mechanism is not fully understood. The study identifies DDB1 as a cellular cofactor of Vpx that is necessary for the ability of Vpx to counteract the macrophage restriction to SIV and HIV-1 infection. DDB1 silencing specifically impairs susceptibility of macrophages to SIV infection, but not to HIV-1 infection. The study suggests that Vpx likely interacts with the reverse transcription complex and uses DDB1 as a tether to interact with the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. The results provide insight into the mechanisms employed by Vpx and Vpr to enhance macrophage infection, which may help identify the macrophage restriction that Vpx antagonizes.
The paper discusses the function of the gene TDAG51 in regulating maternal behavior and depression. The authors found that mice lacking TDAG51 exhibit depressive-like and abnormal maternal behavior after parturition. They observed that these mice exhibit reduced maternal care and susceptibility to depressive-like behavior, as evidenced by reduced pup survival rates and impaired nest-building and retrieval abilities. They found that TDAG51 deficiency leads to changes in the expression of genes involved in neurotransmitter regulation and neuroendocrine factors, including oxytocin, dopamine, serotonin, and GABA, which are linked to maternal behavior and depression. The authors propose that TDAG51 acts as a transcriptional regulator that regulates the expression of these genes and monoamine neurotransmitters in the brain, which may contribute to the development of abnormal maternal behavior and postpartum depression. They identified 2374 differentially expressed genes between TDAG51- and TDAG5+ mice and found that TDAG51 regulates genes involved in monoamine neurotransmitter regulation and neuroendocrine factors. The results suggest that TDAG51 plays a novel role in regulating maternal behavior and may be involved in the development of postpartum depression.
The paper describes the genetic basis of parthenogenesis in the brown alga Ectocarpus siliculus. The authors used a quantitative trait locus (QTL) approach to identify three QTLs that control parthenogenesis in the species. They found that the sex chromosome SDR (SDR) is responsible for parthenogenesis in females, while a major QTL on chromosome 18 and a minor QTL on chromosome 18 are responsible in males. The sex-specific regions of the sex chromosomes have different genetic architectures, with females exhibiting parthenogenesis regardless of alleles at the SDR and P2 loci, while males are parthenogenetic only when carrying the P+ allele at the SDR. The authors observed that male gametes exhibit reduced fitness during sexual reproduction, suggesting that parthenogenesis has a negative impact on male fitness. They propose that parthenogenesis may be a sexually antagonistic trait, with females benefiting from parthenogenesis and males being disadvantaged. The results suggest that fluctuating selection on sex-specific traits in different life stages could maintain genetic variation at the parthenogenesis QTLs. The authors also found that parthenogenic alleles may be protected from selection in the sex-specific regions, allowing them to persist in the population. The study provides insights into the genetic basis of parthenogenesis and how it may have evolved in the brown alga lineage.
This paper investigates the role of variants in the gene NLGN1 in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The authors identify five rare missense variants in NLGN1 in ASD subjects, including a novel variant P89L, which they generate a mouse model of using CRISPR/Cas9. They find that the P89L variant in mice leads to reduced NLGN1 protein expression and impaired social behavior, including deficits in social interaction and spatial memory. The P89L variant also affects cellular localization of NLGN1, leading to decreased synaptic function. The authors suggest that multiple mechanisms, including reduced protein level and abnormal cellular localization, may underlie the pathogenic effects of NLGN1 variants. The study provides the first evidence that NLGN1 variants found in human patients are directly involved in ASD-like phenotypes through multiple mechanisms, and reinforces the critical association between genetic variants in NLGNs and neuropsychiatric disorders. The results suggest that NLGN1 may be an important contributor to ASD susceptibility, but more research is needed to fully understand the relationship.
This paper presents the results of a case-control study conducted in Cameroon to identify risk factors for Buruli ulcer disease, a neglected tropical disease caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans. The study found that wading in the Nyong river swamp and swimming in the river were associated with BU infection, while fishing in the river was protective. Living near a cocoa plantation or woods was also a risk factor. The study identified that low education level was a significant risk factor for BU. The study found that wearing long clothing during farming activities protected against BU. However, the study also found that bed nets were associated with a lower risk of infection. The study suggests that insect bites or contamination of a trauma site may be the primary mode of transmission, but the study's findings suggest that domestic or peridomestic insects, such as mosquitoes, may also play a role. The results provide information on risk factors that can be used to inform public health strategies to reduce the BU burden.
The paper analyzes exposure data collected during the West African Ebola epidemic in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone to understand transmission dynamics, transmission risks, and the role of funerals in spreading the virus. The analysis found that exposures to individuals who had died or were dying from Ebola contributed to transmission, and that hospitalization of cases in healthcare facilities reduced the risk of onward transmission. However, hospitalization did not completely eliminate transmission risk. The number of times a case was named as a potential source contact varied widely, suggesting that simple demographic characteristics are unlikely to identify those most at risk of super-spreading. The study highlights the challenges faced in the field and the need for continued community mobilization and targeted interventions during the declining phase of the epidemic to prevent local flare-ups. The findings provide a quantitative basis for prevention measures against Ebola and demonstrate that safe and dignified burials are important for controlling transmission.
The paper describes the identification and characterization of the interaction between the nucleocapsid protein (N) and the viral RNA polymerase protein (V30) of non-segmented negative-sense RNA viruses like Ebola and Marburg. The V30 protein has a conserved binding site on its C-terminal domain for NP, which is essential for RNA synthesis. The authors used X-ray crystallography and biochemical assays to map the binding site on the NP and determine its importance in the viral nucleocapsid complex. They identified a conserved binding site on the NP for V30 across different ebola and marburg viruses. The VP30-NP interaction was found to have different effects on RNA synthesis, with high affinity binding reducing RNA synthesis activity while low affinity binding allowing greater access to the polymerase. The data suggests that the V30-NP interaction serves to tune RNA synthesis activity to an ideal level for viral infection rather than maximizing it. The authors propose that the interaction tunes the overall RNA synthesis activity and that modestly decreasing the interaction gives a boost to viral RNA synthesis. The study provides insight into the mechanisms by which the VP30-NP interaction regulates RNA synthesis and may guide the development of therapeutics that target this interaction.
The paper discusses the possibility of releasing genetically modified mosquitoes that carry a single anti-dengue gene without using gene drive mechanisms as a means of population replacement, rather than population reduction, as a potential strategy for controlling dengue fever. The authors use a stochastic model of Aedes aegypti mosquito populations in a tropical city to simulate releases of mosquitoes carrying a single anti-dengue gene. They find that even relatively small releases of mosquitoes carrying the anti-dengue gene can significantly reduce the number of competent mosquitoes, especially when released over a long period of time. They compare the effectiveness of different release strategies, including releasing only male mosquitoes, female mosquoes, and both male and female mosquoes, and find that releasing eggs rather than adults can be a more effective way to achieve population replacement. They also find that releasing eggs is easier and requires fewer mosquitoes compared to adults. The results suggest that releasing mosquitoes without gene drive mechanisms can be a viable approach to introduce anti-dengue genes into mosquito populations, especially when releases are spaced out over a long period of time. However, the authors note that immigration of wild-type mosquitoes could undermine population replacement efforts and that releases of female mosquoes may be necessary to achieve full population replacement. The study highlights the importance of assessing the fitness benefits of the anti-dengue gene and the potential for mosquitoes to evolve resistance to it in order to determine the effectiveness of this approach.
This paper discusses how obesity affects protein synthesis in the liver. The authors used polysome profiling to investigate protein synthesis in the liver of genetically obese mice and found that the amount of membrane-bound ribosomes was reduced in the liver of obese mice, consistent with previous studies showing ER dysfunction in obesity. However, despite the decrease in total ribosomes, the polysome profile was shifted toward higher polysomes, suggesting that an eIF2α phosphorylation-independent mechanism was involved. This led to a decrease in protein synthesis. The authors found that genes involved in transcription, splicing and transport were downregulated, while genes involved in mitochondrial protein synthesis were upregulated. They also found that genes involved in bile acid metabolism were significantly downregulated. Overexpression of Cyp7b1, which catalyzes the alternative bile acid synthesis pathway, improved glucose output but also led to cholestasis and liver injury. The results suggest that obesity may have a molecular fasting profile in the liver despite abundant nutrients, and that bile acid metabolism may play a role in the pathogenesis of metabolic disorders. The authors propose that genes commonly regulated by fasting and obesity may harbor novel mechanisms linking insulin resistance to metabolic disorders, while genes regulated by overnight fasting in obese liver may be mainly responsive to nutrient signals. The study demonstrates tissue polysome profiling as a powerful approach to investigate dynamic regulation of protein synthesis.
The paper proposes a "V1 saliency hypothesis" that bottom-up saliency is determined by the most active V1 cell responding to a visual location. This saliency is then used to guide visual attention to the most relevant location, making tasks like visual search and segmentation faster and easier. The authors test this hypothesis by deriving predictions from the hypothesis and comparing them to empirical data. They find that the V1 saliency hypothesis makes accurate predictions about interference from task-irrelevant features and the lack of an advantage for orientation-orientation double features. The V1 saliency hypothesis also explains the emergent grouping of orientation features by spatial configurations, which cannot be explained by traditional saliency frameworks. The findings provide empirical support for the V1 saliency hypothesis and suggest that V1 mechanisms may play a key role in bottom-up attentional selection, as well as top-down attentional binding. The results motivate further research into the neural basis of bottom-up and top-down attentional selection.
The paper examines how double-strand breaks (DSBs) are repaired in yeast. DSBs can be repaired by either nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or homologous recombination (HR). The authors find that repair via HR is kinetically slower than repair via NHEJ. However, repair via HR can only occur if both ends of the break share homology with the donor. If homology to only one of the ends is present, repair proceeds via a different pathway called break-induced replication (BIR). The authors compare repair kinetics and efficiency of repair in strains where the DSB ends involved in repair either arose from the same break (cis) and were tethered together versus repair involving ends from different breaks (trans). They find that repair via HR involving ends from different breaks is kinetically slower than repair involving ends from the same break. The slower kinetics of repair in trans strains is attributed to the lack of end-tethering of the DSB ends, which prevents the ends from traveling together and searching for their homologous donors. The authors suggest that end-tethering may play a role in preventing chromosomal translocations that could arise from repair involving ends from different breaks.
This paper investigates how the presence of multiple helminth infections in a host can modify the impact of a single helminth infection on malaria severity. The authors analyze a dataset of 283 malaria patients in Thailand who were screened for helminth infections and monitored for cerebral malaria development. They identify significant associations between different helminth species and the development of cerebral malaria using a statistical approach called association screening and regression analysis. They find that some helminth infections, particularly Ascaris lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura, have protective effects on cerebral malaria, while others, like hookworm, have detrimental effects. However, the presence of hookworm reduces the protective effect of Trichuris trichiura. The authors conclude that co-infection with multiple helminth species can have complex and cryptic effects on malaria severity, beyond the direct effects of individual helminth species. They suggest that the co-occurrence of certain helminth species can shape the outcome of malaria infection and highlight the importance of considering the parasite community when evaluating disease control strategies.
The paper argues that low genetic diversity on the human Y chromosome cannot be explained solely by differences in reproductive success between males and females, and instead suggests that purifying selection and background selection have played a role in reducing Y chromosome diversity. The authors analyze genome-wide data from 16 unrelated males using a combination of autosomal, X chromosomal, and mitochondrial DNA sequences and find that the diversity on the Y chromosome is significantly lower than expected under a neutral model. They simulate models of purifying selection and background selection and show that these models can explain the observed low diversity. They also find that purifying selection acting on non-coding regions, in addition to coding sites, may be responsible for the reduced diversity on the Y chromosome. The authors conclude that the low diversity on the Y chromosome is consistent with the idea that the Y chromosome has undergone selective pressures, including purifying selection and positive selection, and that the Y chromosome may provide useful information for inferring population history beyond what can be inferred from other markers.
The paper investigates the extent to which neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) targeting different regions of the HIV envelope protein (Env) can neutralize a mixed population of viruses. The authors find that bnMAbs targeting the high-mannose patch and CD4bs have the highest median neutralization levels, while those targeting the V2 apex and MPER have a higher frequency of non-sigmoidal neutralization curves (i.e. plateaus below 10%). The bnMAbs that target the high-mannose patch and CD4bs show standard neutralization curves, while those targeting the V2 apex and MPER show a higher frequency of non-sigmoidal curves. The bnMAbs that target the high-mannose patch tend to have a higher median neutralization level and a narrower distribution of MPN values, while those targeting the V2 apex and MPER have a wider distribution of MPN values. The authors suggest that this difference may be due to the requirement for glycan binding for the highmannose patch bnMAbs and the more variable glycan usage on the V2 apex and MPER. The study shows that incomplete neutralization is not limited to pseudovirus assays and is also observed with patient-derived viruses and molecular clones produced in primary cells. The findings suggest that incomplete neutralization may impact the ability of bnMAbs to provide protection in vivo. Further studies are needed to determine how incomplete neutralization impacts the efficacy of bnMAbs for prophylaxis and vaccine strategies.
This paper investigates the role of a histone acetyltransferase enzyme called GCN5-A in the parasitic protozoan Toxoplasma gondii in response to alkaline stress. The authors find that the parasite possesses two GCN5 enzymes, TgGCN5-A and TgGCN5-B, and that TgGCN5-A is required for the activation of genes that are upregulated in response to alkaline stress. They create a knockout of TgGCN5-A and find that the parasites lacking this enzyme are defective in activating genes required for stress-induced bradyzoite development. Specifically, the parasites lacking TgGCN5-A fail to upregulate genes involved in signaling and gene expression, protein processing and translation, and membrane transport in response to alkaline stress. They also find that the parasites lacking TgGCN5-A are impaired in recovering from alkaline stress and are more sensitive to direct exposure to alkaline stress. The results suggest that TgGCN5-A plays a key role in the Toxoplasma response to alkaline stress and may be a target for novel therapies against Toxoplasma infection. The study provides new insights into the molecular basis of the alkaline stress response in intracellular Toxoplasma.
The paper explores the dynamics of transposable elements (TEs) in bacterial genomes, specifically the ability of TE families to coexist with their hosts over long periods of time without leading to host invasion. The authors use statistical analysis and modeling to examine the abundance of three different TE families in 181 bacterial chromosomes. They find that the TE abundance can be well explained by a simple neutral model with only two parameters: the duplication-deletion ratio and the LGT-deletion ratio. They show that LGT determines the initial spread of TE families across genomes, while duplications and deletions drive the maintenance of stable TE copy numbers within genomes. They also find that host genome size does not significantly affect TE duplication and LGT rates. The results suggest that purifying selection does not play a major role in controlling TE abundance, and that stable coexistence between TE families and hosts is more likely. Instead, a deletion bias in TE dynamics allows TE families to persist in genomes, even when LGT rates are reduced. The authors propose that TE punctuations in TE abundance may occur when LGT and duplication rates become unbalanced, leading to transient TE expansions. They argue that understanding these dynamics could provide insights into how TE elements contribute to genome evolution and adaptation. Overall, the results suggest that TE dynamics follow a neutral process of stable coexistence between TE families and hosts, with punctuated events of TE expansions.
The paper describes a mechanism by which the bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa regulates the host cell's chloride secretion by in the airways. The bacteria secretes a toxin called Cif, which delivers a virulence factor into airway epithelial cells via membranes. The virulence factor inhibits chloride secretion by reducing the amount of apical membrane CFTR. The authors found that Cif does this by increasing the amount of ubiquitinated CFTR, which is then degraded in lysosomes. They showed that Cif inhibits the activity of USP10, a host DUB, which in turn increases the amount of ubiquitinated CFTR. This reduces CFTR abundance in the apical membrane and lysosomal degradation. They conclude that the ability of Pseudomonas to chronically infect the lungs of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia, and bronchiectasis is due in part to the secretion of OMV containing Cif, which inhibits CFTR-mediated chloride secretion and thus, diminishes the mucociliary clearance of respiratory pathogens. Understanding the mechanism by which bacterial toxins regulate host biology provides the basis for therapeutic development to inhibit toxin function and potentially reduce bacterial pathogenesis.
This paper describes a new method for measuring the circulating levels of the insulin-like peptide hormone Ilp2 in Drosophila. The authors found that by tagging the protein with two epitopes at specific locations, they could preserve its in vivo bioactivity while measuring the circulating levels in a sensitive and scalable manner. They used this method to study the regulation of Ilp2 production and secretion in Drosophila IPCs and found that a small fraction of total Ilp2 is secreted from these cells, even after maximal depolarization. They also identified genes that regulate Ilp2 production and secretion in vivo, including genes associated with T2DM in humans. The method should be useful for studying the genetic basis of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia in Drosophila, which could provide insights that could inform human disease research.
The paper proposes a computational approach to identify druggable sites on protein surfaces. The authors hypothesize that the ability of a protein surface to form pockets, which can accommodate small molecules, may be the key determinant of druggability at those sites. They test this hypothesis by using a modified version of the LIGSITEcs algorithm to identify pockets at specific protein interaction sites and compare them to randomly selected surface sites. The results show that pockets at the interaction sites tend to be smaller and more frequent than those at randomly selected surface sites. The authors argue that this indicates that the ability to form pockets may be a key factor in determining druggability, rather than the protein's functional site or chemical properties. They suggest that exploring the pocket shapes could provide clues for identifying complementary small molecules that could be used to design new inhibitors. The approach is shown to be effective for identifying druggable conformations for known protein-protein interaction sites, and could potentially be used to guide the design of new inhibitors for sites where no known inhibitors exist. The authors also note that the approach could be used to identify druggable conformations for multiple interaction sites, potentially leading to new chemotypes.
This paper describes the use of a hybrid imaging system combining atomic force microscopy (AFM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) to study the morphological changes of the plasma membrane during clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) in living cells. The AFM images revealed unique membrane structures at the end stage of CME, such as invaginations and protrusions, as well as the role of specific proteins involved in the process. The authors found that actin dynamics are involved in the capping motion, which is a key step of CME, and also in the growing and stable phases. Inhibition of actin polymerization accelerated CME, while stabilization of the actin network prolonged the lifetime of CCPs. Dynamin was also found to be involved in the closing step of CME, and knockdown of dynamin reduced the capping and re-opening motions. The results provide insights into the role of actin and dynamin in the endocytic process, and suggest that actin dynamics are required for the formation and scission of CCPs. The study demonstrates the power of using a hybrid imaging system to visualize the plasma membrane dynamics with high spatial resolution and simultaneously observe protein localization.
This paper investigated the genetic architecture of salinity tolerance in rice using a genome-wide association study (GWA) of 397,812 SNPs across 365 rice accessions. The study found that salinity tolerance is a complex trait with multiple genetic loci, each with small effects, rather than a single "saltol" gene like in other crops. The study identified a locus on chromosome 4, RNC4, which contains two Na+ transporters, HKT1;1 and HKT1;4, that were found to be associated with root Na+ content during early tillering. The high Na+ alleles of HKT1;1 were found to have higher Na+ transport activity, which was observed to be associated with higher root Na+ content. The results suggest that HKT1;1 is the causal gene for RNC4 and contributes to root Na+ content during early tillering. The frequencies of the high and low root Na+ alleles of HKT;1 were found to differ between rice subpopulations, with indica accessions generally showing higher root Na+ content and japonica accessions showing lower shoot Na+ content. The study also identified haplotypes of HKT1;1 that were associated with high and low root Na+ alleles, which could be traced back to specific rice subpopulations. The results provide evidence that salinity tolerance in rice is regulated by multiple genetic loci and is not solely determined by a single "salt" gene like SalTol.
The paper proposes a model of how the brain could represent a speech signal with a duration longer than the gamma cycle. The model uses multiple gamma oscillations to discretize the neural response, forming a 3-bit binary representation of the signal. The oscillations discretize the neural activity into different cycles, allowing the neural response to be estimated by measuring the time between the firing of the onset cells and the coding cells. The model shows that the representation is robust to moderate noise and time warping of the stimulus, but has a finite resolution of a single gamma cycle. This tradeoff allows for robustness to noise and time warping, but limits the ability to accurately represent exact spike times. The model demonstrates that the oscillations can be used to modulate the frequency of the oscillations to compensate for time warping, potentially allowing for a more robust representation of speech signals. The model also shows that the neural dynamics used are physiologically realistic and comparable to other models of speech processing. The authors suggest that this model could be used as a front-end to a speech recognition system, but more research is needed to test its performance on real speech signals and improve the readout mechanism.
The paper discusses how B cells play a key role in protecting against Necator americanus infections, which are a common parasitic nematode infection that affects a third of the global population. The authors find that B cells can rapidly contribute to immunity against N. brasiliensis infections through multiple mechanisms, including antigen presentation and direct B cell-T cell interactions. They show that B cells that produce IL-13 but not IL-4 are essential for protective immunity against N. brasiliensis re-infection. B cells that produce IL-13 but not IL-4 can rapidly present antigen to T cells, which leads to increased IL-3 production by CD4+ T cells and B cells, and this helps control N. brasiliensis infections. The authors also find that B cells can present antigen through Toll-like receptors, which is an alternative mechanism of B cell antigen presentation. The study demonstrates that B cells are important for protective immunity against N. brasiliensis infections, and that the protective response is independent of BCR-dependent clonal expansion following antigen exposure. Instead, B cells are capable of responding to antigen via less stringent mechanisms, such as direct peptide loading and Toll-like receptors, which can be rapid and do not require clonal expansion. The findings highlight the important role of B cells in controlling N. brasiliensis infections and suggest that B cell responses may be independent of antibody and instead mediated through B cell-T cell interactions.
The paper discusses the potential of using neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against the Ebola virus glycoprotein (GP) as a post-exposure treatment. Eight ZEBOV GP-specific monoclonal antibodies were generated and tested in both mice and guinea pigs for their efficacy in protecting against lethal ZEBOV infection. The results showed that some of the antibodies partially extended survival in mice, while only two of the neutralizing antibodies (2G4 and 4G7) provided 60% survival in guinea pigs. The optimal treatment protocols involved giving the antibodies 1-2 days after infection, as efficacy decreased after 3 days. The neutralizing antibody combination of 1H3, 2G4, and 4G7 provided complete survival in guinea pigs, suggesting that targeting multiple regions of GP may be more effective. However, none of the antibodies were as effective as the previously studied KZ52 antibody, which provided complete protection in both mice and guinea pigs but failed to protect non-human primates. The results suggest that a combination of neutralizing antibodies may be a promising post-exposure treatment for EBOV infection, but further testing in non-human primates is needed to confirm this approach.
The paper describes the discovery and characterization of a small molecule inhibitor of hepatitis C virus (HCV) entry, EI-1. The inhibitor was identified through a high-throughput screening effort using a pseudotyped HCV virus system. The inhibitor was found to be most potent against genotype 1 HCV and functions at a post-attachment step prior to or concomitant with fusion. EI-1 was shown to block cell-to-cell spread of HCVcc infection, indicating that it inhibits the initial attachment step of HCV entry. The mechanism of action was found to be through inhibition of the HCV E1 and E2 envelope proteins, likely through binding to residue 719 in the transmembrane domain of E2. The inhibitor was shown to be effective against genotype 1 HCV, but less effective against genotypes 2-5. Resistance to EI-1 was found to occur through substitutions in residue 719 in the E2 protein. The results suggest that EI-1 could provide a valuable component of combination therapy for HCV infection, particularly when combined with replication inhibitors targeting other viral functions. However, the efficacy of EI-1 in vivo will require evaluation in patient-derived virus and primary hepatocyte cells and long-term clinical studies to prevent the development of resistance.
This paper presents a genome-wide association study of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in a Southern Chinese population. The study found that two independent genetic associations with NPC are centered on the HLA class I genes, specifically the HLA-A and HLA-B genes. The HLA-A*101 allele and associated haplotypes were found to be strongly associated with NPC, with 5 amino acid residues in the peptide binding groove being the key determinants. The HLA-B*16Leu allele was also found to be associated with NPC, but this association was independent of the HLA-A associations. The HLA-C gene was found to be weaker and less associated with NPC. The study used genotyping, sequencing and amino acid analysis to identify the functional variants driving these associations. The authors concluded that the HLA-A*101 allele and the associated amino acid residues in the peptide binding groove are the primary genetic determinants of NPC susceptibility, while the HLA-B*16Leu allele plays a role in NPC development through its ability to bind smaller peptides. The study demonstrates that genetic associations with NPC involve multiple mechanisms and highlights the importance of understanding the functional basis of HLA associations in the disease.
The paper discusses how the lack of knowledge of the number of presymptomatic infected individuals during an emerging infectious disease outbreak affects predictions of whether or not the outbreak will become a major epidemic. The authors use simulations to show that the uncertainty in estimating the number of presymptomatic infected individuals, even when disease transmission parameters are known, causes significant errors in predicting the probability of a major outbreak. They demonstrate this using the example of Ebola virus, but the conclusions apply to all infectious diseases. They find that for diseases with a short incubation period before symptoms, the predicted probability of a major outbreak is most uncertain when the number of presymptomatic infected individuals is high. The authors suggest that diagnostic tests to determine whether asymptomatic individuals are infected could help improve predictions, but note that this would be costly and require careful selection of individuals to test. They conclude that consideration of presymptomatic infection is important when forecasting and controlling the spread of infectious diseases, particularly when planning interventions to slow or prevent their spread.
This paper explores the role of synchronization in protecting neuronal networks from the influence of random noise. The authors argue that synchronization can help nonlinear systems from the effects of intrinsic noise, which affects all neurons in the nervous system. They show this by demonstrating that when neurons are synchronized through mutual couplings, their behaviors are close to those of noise-free systems. This is because synchronization allows for the linear effect of averaging noise, while preserving the signal. They use a nonlinear neuron model with gap-junction-like couplings to show that synchronized neurons become "protected" from noise, even when the noise intensity is large. The authors conclude that synchronization may represent a fundamental mechanism to protect neuronal assemblies from noise, strengthening their understanding of the role of synchronization in the brain. They also discuss the broader implications of synchronization as a mechanism to improve precision in nonlinear systems, beyond the case of phase oscillators studied previously. The findings suggest that ensemble measurements from the brain may actually represent the "nominal trajectory" of synchronized neurons, which could be a candidate for brain-machine interfaces.
The paper examines the genetic variation and phylogenetic composition of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in Colombia, which is a hyper-endemic country for dengue fever. The study found that two distinct genetic lineages of the mosquitoes exist, one associated with West Africa and one with East Africa, and these lineages have different ecological characteristics and distribution patterns across different cities in Colombia. The lineages are found to have different vector competence for yellow fever and dengue viruses, and respond differently to vector control measures. The high genetic diversity of the line associated with East Africa is found in cities where insecticides are commonly used, while the low genetic diversity of the line associated with West Africa is found in cities with lower dengue incidence. The study suggests that distinct colonization routes occurred in northern South America and multiple introductions of populations derived from ancestral lineages occurred in Colombia. The findings indicate that genetic structure of Ae. aegypti populations can influence their ability to transmit arboviruses and that vector control measures targeting distinct lineages may be more effective. Further studies on vector competence of the lineages are needed to better understand how they impact dengue transmission. The study provides valuable information on the genetic basis of dengue epidemiology in Colombia and can help improve vector control strategies.
The paper discusses the genetic diversity and recombination within the Brazilian population of the Cryptocococcus neoformans subtype VGII. The study analyzed 145 clinical and environmental isolates from Brazil using MLST and found 81 different sequence types, with high genetic variability and homoplasy among the isolates. The results suggest that the Brazilian VGII population is composed of 3 main groups, one of which is composed of the highly virulent subtype VGIIa (ST20) and 2 other groups linked to the subtype VGIIb (ST7). Recombination events were detected among the isolates, which may have contributed to the high genetic diversity. The study found that the VGII subtypes responsible for the outbreaks in North America originated from South America, likely from the Amazon rainforest, and were then transmitted to North America and other parts of the world. The Brazilian isolates showed a high level of haplotype diversity and homoplasy, indicating that recombination has occurred, leading to the genetic diversity observed. The study suggests that the emergence of highly virulent strains in Brazil likely occurred in the northeast and north regions, which have undergone extensive deforestation and habitat changes due to human activities. The findings indicate that the Brazilian population is composed of multiple ancestral lineages, likely translocating from the caating/cerrado ecosystems in South America and adapting to new habitats, leading to the spread of C. neoformans to new regions.
The paper describes an experiment in which the authors administered the combination of an antibiotic (Rifaximin) and an anti-inflammatory drug (Sulfasalazine) to non-human primates (NHPs) infected with SIV to test whether controlling microbial translocation and immune activation would improve the outcome of the infection. They found that treatment with the combination of the two drugs during the early stages of infection (before mucosal damage) significantly reduced microbial translocation and immune activation, as measured by plasma LPS levels, CD14 expression on macrophages, HLA-DR expression on T cells, T cell proliferation, and cytokine production. However, the effect was only transient and did not last beyond the duration of the 3 month treatment. The authors suggest that the limited efficacy of the treatment may be due to the fact that the antibiotic therapy can only partially reduce the microbial flora of the gut, but cannot prevent breaches in the intestinal wall, and the high levels of immune activation at the end of acute infection. The study supports the current paradigm that controlling microbial translocation is a key factor in the pathogenesis of HIV/SIV infection, but highlights the challenges of achieving long-term control of microbial translocation in humans, where antibiotic therapy may have limited efficacy and induce dysbiosis. The results provide insight into the mechanisms of HIV/SIV infection and may guide the development of anti-inflammatory therapies aimed at controlling microbial translocation.
This paper examines the expression of the CD24 protein on CD8+ T cells in patients with HAM/TSP (Human T-cell leukemia-associated myelopathy/trophic spastic paraparesis) compared to healthy donors. The authors found that CD24 was overexpressed on CD8+ T cells of HTLV-infected patients compared to healthy donors, particularly in patients with HAM/TSP. CD24 expression correlated with T cell activation and was found to be associated with the expansion of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. The adaptor protein SAP was also found to be overexpressed on CD8+ T cells of patients with HAM/TSP. Blocking CD24 or knocking down SAP inhibited cytotoxic activity and IFN-gamma expression of CD8+ T cells from patients with HAM/TSP. The authors suggest that the CD24/SAP pathway is involved in the activation and dysregulation of CD8+ T cells in HAM/TSP, particularly in the context of high levels of CD24 expression on CD8+ T cells. The results have implications for understanding the pathogenesis of inflammatory neurological disorders associated with an imbalance of immune function.
The paper discusses the results of a study on the function of the Mus8 protein in mice meiosis. Mus8 is a protein that is involved in meiotic recombination repair, specifically in the repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs). The study found that mice lacking Mus8 have reduced fertility due to defects in meiotic progression and meiotic recombination. The researchers found that Mus8 is involved in two distinct pathways of meiotic recombination repair, one that is dependent on the Mus1 protein and one that is interference-independent. The Mus8 protein appears to be required for a subset of recombination intermediates that are not repaired by the Mus1-dependent pathway. The Mus8 protein also appears to act downstream of Rad51 in repairing these interference-independent recombination events. The study showed that Mus8 is involved in both early and late stages of meiotic recombination repair, and there is crosstalk between the Mus1-dependent and Mus8-dependent pathways. The Mus8 protein appears to be involved in the repair of double-strand breaks in vivo, as it can cleave intact HJs in vitro. The study suggests that the Mus8 protein is involved in complex integration between the Mus1 and MLH1-MLH3 pathways, perhaps mediated by BLM, to control crossover number. The results suggest that Mus8 is responsible for processing a distinct subset of recombination events in mice, which differs from its function in other species. The authors propose that Mus8 acts both early and late in meiotic recombination repair.
The paper discusses the serological profiles of mothers of microcephaly cases and controls in a hyperendemic area of dengue transmission in Northeast Brazil during the first wave of Zika virus outbreak. The study found that a majority of mothers had exposure to multiple flaviviruses, with dengue serotypes DENV-3 and DENV-4 being the most common. However, only 8% of mothers had recent Zika virus exposure, suggesting a lag time between virus exposure and delivery. The high prevalence of Zika exposure and low frequency of recent Zika virus exposure at delivery suggest that maternal samples may represent late convalescent serum, rather than true recent infection. The efficient transfer of Zika and dengue antibodies across the placenta was observed, consistent with previous studies. The study demonstrates that Zika virus exposure is high in this population, even among mothers with low levels of Zika antibodies, and highlights the need for screening for Zika immune status throughout pregnancy to monitor congenital Zika syndrome in endemic areas.
The paper proposes a mathematical model of type 2 diabetes (T2D) onset that suggests that the transition from pre-diabetes to overt T2D is associated with a sudden switch in the inflammatory state of the pancreatic beta cells. The model posits that the inflammatory response, mediated by interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), plays a key role in the progression of T2D. The authors propose that IL-1 beta induces a bi-stable switch between two different states of beta cell function, with high levels of IL-1 beta corresponding to overt T2D and low levels to pre-diabetes. The model shows that the onset of T2D is triggered by a sudden transition from a stable pre-diabetic state to an unstable overt T2D state, characterized by high levels of IL-1 beta. The authors argue that this IL-1 beta switch is necessary to explain the observed inefficacy of glucose control in long-standing T2D patients and the effectiveness of glucose control in pre-diabetes. They propose that a combined glucose-lowering and anti-inflammatory therapy is necessary to stop the loss of functional beta cell mass in overt T2D and eventually restore the pre-diabetic state. The model suggests that the optimal duration and dose of anti-inflammatory therapy depend on the individual's endogenous inflammatory state at the start of treatment. The model provides a framework for discussing the effectiveness of different therapies for T2D patients based on their inflammatory levels. However, the model is limited by its assumptions that in vitro data accurately reflect in vivo processes and that  beta cell dynamics are not fully captured.
The paper describes a study on how CD8+ T cells contribute to the development of pathology in cutaneous leishmaniasis, a disease caused by the parasite Leishmania. The authors found that CD8+ T cells within lesions express high levels of genes associated with cytotoxicity and perforin, indicating that they are cytotoxic. CD8+ T cells transferred into mice depleted of CD4+ T cells promoted larger lesions and metastatic lesions, while CD8+ T cells transferred alone did not. This suggests that CD8+ T cells mediate pathology through cytotoxicity rather than IFNγ production. The authors found that perforin-expressing CD8+ T cells are required for this pathology, but cannot rule out a role for NK cells. The results demonstrate a bifurcation in CD8+ T cell function, where CD8+ T cells provide protection in visceral leishmanias but promote pathology in cutaneous leishmaniasis. Understanding what mechanisms control CD8+ T cell function in leishmanias may lead to the development of new therapies to treat immunopathologic sequelae. The study highlights the importance of evaluating the CD4∶CD8 ratio in biopsies as a predictor of disease outcome.
This paper uses a genome-scale model of Escherichia coli metabolism and quantitative proteomics to investigate the role of unused protein expression in shaping microbial growth rates. The authors find that unused protein expression, or protein that is not utilized for cellular growth in a given environment, can vary greatly across different environments, and this variation can explain a significant portion of the variability in growth rates across environments. They identify two types of unused protein: unutilized protein that is not used for cellular growth, and underutilized protein that is catalytically active but present in excess. They show that the core proteome, which is utilized across all environments, is largely responsible for the observed variation in unutilized protein. The core proteome, which is utilized across all environments, increases with growth rate, while the non-core proteome, which is utilized under alternative carbon sources, decreases with growth rate. The non-core proteome is largely unutilized across environments and the expression of the non-core proteome can be attributed to the activity of the transcription factor CRP. The expression of the non-core proteome, particularly the C-proteome, is found to increase in response to nutrient shifts and limitations. The paper suggests that the expression of unused protein is an important source of fitness costs that can be beneficial in varying environments, but also imposes a fitness cost on steady-state growth. The allocation of the proteome towards growth, nutrient readiness and stress resistance can result in trade-offs between specialist and generalist strategies. Overall, the study highlights the importance of considering unused protein expression in genome-scale models to improve predictions of microbial growth rates and fitness.
This paper discusses the discovery of a protein kinase A (PKA) in the adult stage of the Schistosoma mansoni parasite, which is responsible for the parasite's viability. The authors identified a full-length cDNA sequence encoding a PKA-C subunit, named SmPKA-C, that is expressed in all life stages of the parasite's life cycle, including adult worms. Treatment with an inhibitor of PKA activity was found to be lethal to the parasites, demonstrating that SmPKA-C is essential for parasite viability. RNA interference of the SmPKA-C gene resulted in significant loss of PKA activity in parasite lysates, suggesting that this gene is critical for parasite survival. The authors propose that targeting SmPKA may be an attractive new target for schistosomiasis treatment, as the remaining PKA activity in RNAi-treated worms may be due to residual SmPKA-C expression. The discovery of multiple PKA isoforms in adult schistosomes suggests that further investigation is needed to determine the full complement of PKA genes and their expression. The potential to manipulate PKA activity using cAMP analogs provides an additional opportunity for parasite control beyond direct inhibition of PKA-C subunits. The study highlights the similarities between parasite and cancer chemotherapy and suggests that new approaches developed for cancer treatment may provide leads for anti-parasitic drug development.
The paper proposes a model that shows how changes in the voltage sensitivity of the cardiac muscarinic receptor M2R affects the activity of the ion channel KACh, which in turn affects the heart rate. The M2R is intrinsically voltage sensitive, meaning its affinity for ACh varies with membrane potential. The model shows that subsaturating concentrations of ACh preferentially activate KACh during diastolic membrane potentials, slowing the spontaneous firing rate, while depolarizing concentrations activate KACh less. The model provides a proof-of-principle that altered M2R voltage sensitivity could contribute to cardiovascular diseases associated with changes in vagal tone, such as vagally-mediated atrial fibrillation and syndrome of inappropriate sinus tachycardia. The model is able to simulate the effects of genetic variants that shift the M2R occupancy towards a hyperpolarized or depolarized state, showing how these could affect IK,ACh and heart rate. While there are some limitations to the model, it provides a mechanistic foundation to study the role of M2R voltage sensitivity in cardiac diseases. The results suggest that altered M2R voltage sensitivity could be an important target for controlling or preventing atrial arrhythmias.
This paper proposes a computational model of electrical synaptic transmission between neurons that accounts for the dynamic changes in gap junction conductance due to voltage gating and chemical modulation. The model is based on a 36-state Markov chain model of gap junction channel gating, which allows for more realistic simulations of the rectification and voltage dependence of gap junction conductance. The model shows that the rectification of gap junctions can significantly affect the asymmetry of electrical transmission, while chemical modulation of gap junctions can also induce short-term plasticity and prolong the duration of the effect. The authors simulate electrical transmission between two neurons connected through a soma-somatic gap junction and demonstrate that chemical modulation of gap junctions can reproduce experimental observations of junctional conductance decay and changes in spiking activity. They also show that chemically mediated gating can expand the time window of electrical synaptic plasticity, even in low voltage-sensitive gap junctions like connexin 36. The model provides a framework for understanding the role of gap junction voltage gating and chemical modulation in regulating electrical synaptic strength and neuronal synchrony, and may have practical applications for modeling neuronal networks and disease. However, the model requires computational resources and future extensions to include dendritic and chemical synapses.
The paper describes a novel ATM-mediated pathway involving the regulation of miRNA miR-35 by CREB that impacts the DNA damage response. ATM kinase downregulates miR-35 expression through phosphorylation of CREB after DNA damage, which in turn suppresses the expression of CtIP, a protein involved in DNA end resection and HR. This regulates the choice of DNA repair pathway, cell cycle checkpoint regulation, and DNA repair. The authors found that miR-35 overexpression sensitizes cells to radiation damage and causes defects in DNA repair, while reducing CtIP protein levels rescues these defects. They identified two patient-derived radiosensitive lymphoblast cell lines that had reduced miR-35 expression and demonstrated that miR-35 overexpression reduced BRCA1 foci formation and colony survival. They also found that miR-35 overexpression changed cell cycle distribution before radiation and reduced CtIP protein levels. The study suggests that miR-35 may be a promising candidate for radiosensitizer for breast cancer radiation therapy or chemotherapy, potentially by making tumor cells more sensitive to DNA damage and suppressing tumor metastasis. The study also highlights the intriguing connection between miR-35 and the DDR through its regulation of CREB and CtIP.
The paper investigates the prevalence of Amphimerus sp. infection in domestic cats and dogs in communities where high prevalence has been reported in humans. The study found that cats were significantly more likely to be infected than dogs, with a prevalence of 7.4% compared to 3.8%. The eggs found in the stools of cats and dogs were morphologically similar to those of other members of the Opisthorchiidae family. Adult flukes obtained from infected animals were also morphologically and molecularly similar to those found in humans, confirming that cats and dogs act as definitive hosts for Amphimer sp. transmission. The study suggests that domestic animals play a role in transmitting the disease to humans, particularly cats who are more likely to eat raw or undercooked fish and swim in the river. However, the sample size was small and only one sample was obtained from each animal, so further research is needed to validate the findings. The results provide evidence that cats and dogs act as reservoirs for Amphimer sp. infection, which could inform public health control strategies to treat infected animals and humans.
The paper discusses why HIV has evolved to have a much lower surface density of spikes compared to other viruses. The authors propose that this is because HIV primarily infects T helper cells and significantly depletes their numbers during early stages of infection, leading to increased competition between B cells during affinity maturation. When T helper cell numbers are limiting, selection forces are weaker and a high spike density may not favor high affinity antibodies. However, when T helper cell numbers decline further, selection forces remain strong at higher spike densities, allowing HIV to avoid effective antibody responses. This results in high affinity antibodies being produced during affinity maturation. The authors also suggest that the low spike density may aid HIV to hide from the immune system for a longer period, as it is infectious for an extended period. The paper's findings may guide vaccine design by optimizing the density of antigens displayed on vaccine vectors to maximize B cell selection and affinity maturation in the lymph node follicle.
This paper describes a study using phosphoproteomics to investigate the temporal dynamics of activity-dependent phosphorylation of proteins in synaptosomes and neurons after depolarization with 20 mM and 76 mM potassium. The authors used a new computational approach called KinSwing to identify kinases that are potentially phosphorylated in response to the stimulus. They found that CaMKIIα was highly activated and correlated with phosphorylation of synapsin 1. Bassoon, a protein that is highly phosphorylated in response to depolarization, was identified as a major target of poststimulus phosphorylation. They also found that MAPK1 was a key protein kinase that phosphorylated synapsin 1. The poststimulus phosphorylation of synapsin 1 and other proteins was associated with increased activity-dependent phosphorylation of dynamin 1, synaptic vesicle and exocytosis proteins. The study identified several protein kinases that mediate the poststimulus up-regulation of phosphorylation, including CaMKIIα, CDK1/2, CDK5 and PKA. The results suggest that the poststimulus phosphorylation of synapsin 1 may be involved in a homeostatic plasticity mechanism that dampens the effects of strong stimuli. The study provides a valuable resource for future studies of activity-dependent phosphorylation and highlights the importance of identifying the protein domains and functions that are mechanistically linked to neuronal activity.
The paper discusses the different ways that animals may represent space and navigate using a process called path integration (PI). The authors propose a classification system for spatial representations based on whether they are centered on the animal (egocentric) or outside the animal (allocentric), and whether they require updating directional components during PI. They show that any egocentric (centered) representation of space accumulates errors in a way similar to an idiothetic walk in real space, while allocentric (outside the animal) representations accumulate errors in a way similar to an allothetic walk. This means that PI using any of these representations will result in large random errors and nonlinear systematic errors, while allocentric static vectorial representations can faithfully capture geometric and metric properties of real trajectories. The authors argue that allocentric static vectorial representations are the most likely to be used by biological nervous systems for navigation, since they can be generated dynamically during navigation and map allocentric landmarks. However, they note that there is a lack of electrophysiological evidence for any particular type of PI system in arthropods, and that ring-like models may be better suited to model systematic errors of PI. The study provides a theoretical foundation for understanding how animals represent space and navigate, which could guide future experiments and modeling.
The paper proposes a new model for how spectrin proteins, which are known to be involved in actin filament crosslinking, can exist in both compact and extended forms. The compact form is thought to be around 5-6 nanometers long, while the extended form is around 20 nanometers long. The authors propose that the dynamic linker region between spectrin repeats can remodel to produce a two-start helix structure that is consistent with the observed spectrin tetramer length. They propose a "Chinese Finger Trap" model, where sequential spectrin repeats are aligned so that the high affinity interaction between adjacent repeats is maintained. The model predicts that spectrin is a hollow cylinder in its resting length, and that the linker region can convert between an alpha helix and a pi-helix upon extension or contraction. The model is supported by experimental evidence from structural mass spectrometry and electron microscopy, including the observed length of the spectrin tetramer, the presence of a hollow core, and the predicted interactions between adjacent spectrin repeats. The model also explains why spectrin cannot form a closed heterodimer in the extended form, which is only observed in electron microscopy. The authors propose that the Chinese Finger Trap model is relevant to other non-erythrocytic spectrin forms.
The paper discusses the involvement of membrane-bound nanodomains in plant defense against viruses. The authors used the REM1.3 protein as a model to investigate how plant defense against viruses is mediated by protein phosphorylation. They found that the plant virus sensing protein TGBp1 triggers the phosphorylation of REM1.3, which in turn modulates its association with the plasma membrane and partitioning between the plasma membrane nanodomes and the plasmodesmata-plasma junction. The phosphorylated REM1.3 reduces the permeability of the plasma membrane and restricts the spread of the virus. The authors identified the calcium-dependent kinase AtCPK3 as the kinase that phosphorylates REM1.3. Overexpression of AtCPK3 together with REM1.3 restricts the spread of the virus. The study suggests that phosphorylation of REM proteins may play a key role in plant defense against viruses, specifically by modulating membrane dynamics and protein interactions. The exact mechanisms of how this occurs remain to be determined.
The paper discusses how the cytomegalovirus (HCMV) encodes two glycoproteins, gp34 and gp68, that bind to the surface of infected cells and interfere with the activation of host immunoglobulin G (IgG) receptors, thereby evading the host immune response. The study identifies the specific immunoglobulin G receptors that are targeted by gp34 and gp68 and demonstrates that the two glycoproteins act as antagonists of IgG-mediated immune responses. The authors show that gp68, but not gp34, binds to the FcγRII/III and FcγRI, while gp34 binds to FcγRI and FcγRI/III. Soluble gp34 and gp68 remain potent inhibitors of IgG-mediated immune responses, suggesting that the functional inactivation of the host FcγR occurs independently of fixation of the opsonized IgG to the plasma membrane. The results suggest that shedding of these glycoproteins may be part of the molecular blueprint of particular viral FcγRs. The study provides insights into how HCMV evades the host immune response and could inform the development of a targeted immunotherapy of HCMV diseases.
The paper investigates the role of IL-32γ in regulating macrophage functions during Leishmania infection. The authors show that Leishmania species, particularly L. amazonensis, induce higher levels of IL-32γ mRNA and protein than L. braziliensis in human macrophages, which is intracellularly expressed and localized to the cytoplasm and nucleus. IL-32γ upregulates the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNFα, IL-1β and IL-8, while silencing IL-32γ reduces TNFα production. Overexpression of IL-32γ causes an increase in TNFα mRNA stability and protein levels, leading to higher TNFα production. IL-32γ also induces the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and IL-1Ra. The results suggest that IL-32γ plays a crucial role in controlling macrophage functions during Leishmania infection, inhibiting the uptake of parasites and inducing microbicidal molecules, contributing to the control of infections caused by L. amazonensis. The study suggests that the differential production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines by L.amazonensis and L. braziliensis may contribute to the different clinical manifestations of leishmaniasis caused by these two species. The findings provide new insights into the role of IL-32γ in the immune response and may be useful for developing new therapies for leishmaniasis.
The paper presents a new method called "phylometabolic analysis" that combines phylogenetic and metabolic analysis to reconstruct the evolutionary history of metabolic pathways. The method uses flux balance analysis (FBA) to model metabolic networks and constraints from gene presence/absence data to reconstruct the ancestral metabolic pathways. The authors apply this method to reconstruct the evolutionary history of carbon fixation, focusing on the pathways that produce glycine and serine. They find that the ancestral carbon fixation pathway was likely direct reduction of THF, which was later modified within the archaeal domain and transferred to bacteria. This reconstruction shows that energy optimization was a key selective force driving the evolution of different carbon fixation pathways. The paper highlights the importance of considering both the metabolic and phylogenetic constraints to reconstruct the early evolution of metabolism, and demonstrates how the method can be used to reconstruct full metabolic networks.
The paper compares the effectiveness of Esperanza Window Traps (EWTs) and human landing collections (HLCs) for collecting anthropophilic blackflies, which transmit Onchocercias volulus, the parasitic filaria responsible for onchocerciasis. EWTs were found to be less effective than HLCs for collecting Simulium damnosum sensu stricto, the principal vector of onchocercias in Uganda, although they were more effective in Tanzania. The reasons for the differences in trap efficacy between countries are unclear but may be due to differences in the behavior of different sibling species of Simulium damnosum. The paper highlights the potential of EWTs as a tool for onchocercias surveillance in sub-Saharan Africa, but notes that further research is needed to better understand blackfly behavior and improve EWT designs to collect the same number of anthropophilic blackflies as humans. The paper also notes that non-anthropophilic Simulium species were collected on EWTs, indicating that EWTs may not be effective for collecting other Simulium species.
The paper describes the first report of MLST of Bartonella bacillis performed directly from blood samples in patients with Oroya's fever, a neglected tropical disease endemic in South America. Seven blood samples from Northern Peru were collected during an outbreak and two from asymptomatic carriers. Four distinct STs were identified, including a new ST9 found in two samples from the Cachachi outbreak. The study shows that MLST can be used to study the genetic heterogeneity of the B. bacillis population and may help identify STs associated with different clinical symptoms and disease phases. However, limitations include the inability to distinguish polyclonal infections and low bacterial burden in asymptomatic carriers. The findings highlight the need for further studies to better understand the relationship between specific STs and clinical symptoms and disease severity. The results provide new insights into the genetic diversity of this poorly understood bacterium and the potential for MLST to inform clinical management of Oroya's fever.
The paper compares the genomes of two fungal pathogens, Mycosphaerella graminicola and Mycosphaerella subspecies 1 (S1), which infect wheat and Agropyron repens, respectively. The study found that the genomes of the two pathogens have undergone different evolutionary changes, with the essential chromosomes showing higher substitution rates and more conserved genes compared to the dispensable chromosomes, which have more structural changes and pseudogenes. The dispensable chromosomes in S1 are smaller and have a fragmented pattern of aligned sequences, suggesting they are not entirely homologous to the dispensable chromosomes in M. graminicola. The study also found that the dispensable chromosomes show different patterns of molecular evolution compared to the essential chromosomes, with higher Ka/Ks ratios, lower synonymous substitution rates, and a higher frequency of pseudogenes. The authors suggest that the different evolutionary patterns of the two chromosomes may be due to the irregular transmission of the dispensable chromosomes, leading to less polymorphism and less divergence. They identified 43 genes with evidence of positive selection, most of which are located on the essential chromosomes. The study provides insights into the evolution of these fungal pathogens and how they adapted to their respective hosts, with the dispensable chromosomes likely containing redundant genes that do not play an essential role in fitness. The findings suggest that genome rearrangements and positive selection have contributed to the speciation of M. graminicola and S1.
The paper proposes a framework to explain why different brain areas contribute differently to perceptual decisions in binary choice tasks. The authors show that when brain areas are correlated, the behavioral effects of inactivating them do not necessarily match their contribution to the decision-related activity of individual neurons. They propose two models: an extensive information model where the brain extracts most of the available information from the population, and a limited information model where the brain extracts only a fraction of the information. They use experiments to show that the extensive information model can explain why some brain areas are better predictors of perceptual decisions but have weaker behavioral effects of inactivation, while the limited information model can explain why other brain areas have stronger behavioral effects but weaker correlation with neuron activity. The two models imply that the brain integrates information suboptimally across brain areas, leading to suboptimal decoding. The results suggest that the brain can extract useful information from a large portion of the population but discard most of the available information, which may be a key factor limiting performance in complex tasks. The framework provides a practical way to distinguish between the two models and test their predictions experimentally, and could help explain why different brain areas contribute differently to perceptual decisions in binary choice tasks.
The paper presents a model of environmental transmission of influenza that considers four different transmission modes: contact, respiratory, direct-droplet-spray, and contact-mediated transmission. The model is an agent-based model that uses parameter values from empirical studies to describe the transmission process. The authors show that the relative importance of each transmission mode can vary depending on factors related to the pathogen, host and environment. They find that high host density leads to conditions where multiple modes operate at a high intensity. They also show that self-inoculation rate is the most important factor influencing contact transmission. They argue that one transmission mode intervention may not be sufficient in all settings and that interventions should be tailored to the specific features of the venue, host and pathogen. They suggest extending the model to examine realistic interventions and incorporating multiple transmission routes to model infection spread in more complex settings like multiple venues. Overall, the paper highlights the importance of considering multiple transmission modes and tailoring interventions to specific contexts rather than relying solely on one approach.
The paper discusses the association between Fasciola hepatica infection and liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and cancer. The authors conducted a systematic review of the literature to assess the evidence for an association between Fasciola infection and liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and cancer. They found that there is some evidence in animal models and case reports that Fasciola infection can cause liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, but no evidence of a direct association with cancer. The authors suggest that Fasciola infection may activate hepatic stellate cells and induce inflammation, leading to liver fibrosis. However, the long-term clinical complications of Fasciola infection in humans are not well established, especially in endemic populations. The authors argue that there is a need for population-based studies to assess whether patients with Fasciola infection are more likely to develop liver fibrosis and cirrhosis compared to non-infected patients, and for studies on the early detection and treatment of acute Fasciola infection to prevent long-term liver damage. The paper highlights the limitations of the current evidence, including the absence of published population studies on the association between Fasciola and liver cancer. The authors conclude that there is some evidence to suggest an association between Fasciola and liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, but further studies are needed to establish the relationship between Fasciola and cancer.
The paper discusses the potential of using a combination of mTOR inhibitors and oncolytic viruses to treat cancer. The authors found that while mTOR inhibitors like rapamycin can reduce viral replication in normal cells, they actually enhance viral replication in cancer cells, suggesting that cancer cells have a dysregulated eIF4E/4E-BP ratio that promotes viral translation. They propose that targeting this dysregulation with dual mTORC1 and 2 inhibitors and oncolytic viruses could selectively kill mTOR-resistant cancer cells. They demonstrate this by showing that cancer cells with high eIF4E expression are resistant to mTOR inhibition and that forcing eIF4E expression or reducing 4E-BP expression in cancer cells can sustain viral protein synthesis. They also show that combining mTOR inhibitors and oncolytic viruses can reduce tumor size and prolong survival in an aggressive breast cancer model. The authors suggest that targeting the eIF4E/4E-BP ratio could be a promising approach for cancer treatment, but that issues like immune suppression and latent viral reactivation need to be considered.
The paper aimed to assess the effectiveness of mass drug administration (MDA) programs for schistosomiasis control, specifically focusing on coverage rates among school-age children (SAC). It found that combined community and school-based delivery achieved the highest coverage rates, followed by community-only delivery, then school-only delivery. However, coverage was consistently lower among non-enrolled children compared to enrolled children. The paper identified several factors that affected coverage rates, including limited disease knowledge, fear of side effects, unequal age and gender uptake, lack of drug-distributor motivation and local political effects. The authors suggested that small, targeted program modifications could increase coverage, such as providing food for treated children, educational campaigns, increased CDD training and incentivization, and active inclusion of marginalized populations. The study highlighted that achieving high coverage is important but also continual monitoring of treatment efficacy is needed to ensure elimination of the disease.
The paper describes an example of a single-locus incompatibility that leads to a complex set of phenotypes in Arabidopsis thaliana hybrids. The hybrid incompatibility is caused by two alleles at the receptor-like kinase (RLK) gene OUTGROWTH-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN KINASE (OAK) that are underdominant for fitness when heterozygous, but overdominant when homozygous. The OAK genes are part of a highly variable tandem array with evidence of gene conversion and duplications in the recent evolutionary past. The OAK promoter was duplicated to change the expression domain from the leaf lamina to the petiole, which is required for the hybrid phenotype. The second malectin-like domain between the OAKBla and OAKSha proteins has diverged, which likely altered their affinity for an unknown ligand. The authors propose that OAK heterodimers have increased affinity for this ligand, leading to ectopic activation of the downstream signaling pathway and aberrant development. The high variability of the OAK cluster and the fact that the OAK proteins can cause a hybrid-like phenotype on their own suggests that the OAK proteins interact with an unknown ligand. The paper suggests that genes in variable tandem repeats, such as NB-LR genes, are predisposed to being sources for the creation of novel hybrid phenotypes and may contribute to speciation.
The paper proposes an agent-based model to study the growth and development of budding yeast colonies. The model considers various biological processes such as budding, mating, cell death, cell size changes due to aging, and cell-cell interactions. The authors find that the type of budding pattern used by haploid cells (axial or random) affects the mating efficiency and colony expansion. Axial budding enhances mating efficiency at early stages of colony development, while bipolar budding is important for colony expansion under nutrient limitation. They also find that the frequency of mating type switch controls the trade-off between efficient diploidization and inbreeding. The age of the colony affects the mating probability but not the spatial distribution of cells. The model can be extended to include more biological details such as cell morphology changes and intracellular signaling pathways. The agent-based approach has limitations due to computational cost but can provide insights into the development of yeast colonies at a small population scale. The model can serve as a framework to study other multicellular organisms.
The paper presents an analysis of the burden of African trypanosomiasis in Uganda at a sub-national scale, using the disability-adjusted life year (DALY) metric. The study estimates the burden of both rhodesiense and gambiense forms of the disease in Uganda over the period 2000-2009, accounting for both reported and unreported cases, and maps the results by parish and district. The authors find that the burden is significantly higher than the global burden estimates, with a large portion of the burden coming from unreported cases, particularly for rhodesiense. They highlight that the spatial variation in burden is significant, with highly affected parishes having much higher burden than the national average. The study demonstrates the value of estimating burden at a sub-national scale to account for focal disease epidemics and spatial variation in burden. However, they acknowledge that there are limitations in estimating parameters, particularly under-reporting rates, and highlight the need for improved disease surveillance to better account for the under-reported burden. The study emphasizes the importance of sub-national burden evaluation for targeted interventions in highly affected areas.
The paper describes a new method for identifying the relapsing fever bacteria Borrelia spp. transmitted by ticks using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). The authors created a database of MSPs for 14 Borrelia isolates and used the technique to detect Borrelia in infected ticks. They found that MALDI-TOF-MS can identify Borrelia at a concentration of 104 spirochetes/L, which is the same range as previously reported for Leptospira. The technique was validated by blindly testing the MSPs of the Borrelia isolates against other bacteria and ticks and found that the Borrelia MSPs could identify the infected ticks with a sensitivity and specificity of 89% and 93.75%. They also found that the presence of Borrelia infection did not affect the ability of MALDI-TOF-MS to identify the ticks. An MSP for the soft tick species Ornithodoros sonrai was added to the database to allow for blind identification of infected ticks. Using this extended database and a piece of subtraction software, MALDI-TOF-MS was able to detect the soft tick species Ornithodoros sonrai and the vector Borrelia crocidura within 45 minutes. This study demonstrates that MALDI-TOF-MS can be used for the rapid identification of ticks and vectorized pathogens like Borrelia.
The paper discusses the role of type I and type II interferons in regulating the host response to influenza A virus infection. The authors found that type I interferons are necessary but not sufficient to recruit classical Ly6Chi inflammatory monocytes to the lungs of infected mice, while type II interferons synergize with type I interferons to suppress neutrophil migration. In contrast, type I interferons are able to directly regulate the phenotype and function of monocytes, suppressing their activation into pro-inflammatory Ly6Clo monocytes/macrophages. The authors also found that type I interferons inhibit monocyte activation by inducing IFN-γ receptor expression, which in turn suppresses the pro-inflammatory potential of Ly6Clo monocytes. The study reveals a complex interplay between type I and II interferons in regulating the host response to influenza virus infection, with type I interferons playing a major role in preventing tissue damage by controlling monocyte activation. The study suggests that blocking type I interferon signaling may be a potential therapeutic strategy to reduce hyperinflammatory responses to influenza infection.
The paper describes a computational approach to predict the promoter regions of microRNA genes in four model organisms (C. elegans, H. sapiens, A. thaliana, and O. sativa). The approach, called CoVote, uses a discriminative model to distinguish microRNA promoters from other intergenic sequences based on features from known microRNA promoters and protein-coding genes. The discriminative models show that most microRNA genes have the same type of promoters as protein-coding genes, and therefore are likely transcribed by pol II. CoVote predicts the core promoter regions of most known microRNA genes in these species, and finds that putative promoters are typically located close to pre-microRNA hairpins. The paper also identifies a number of conserved motifs in the putative microRNA promoters that are likely to be important for transcriptional regulation. These motifs include TATA-box, CT repeats, CpG islands, Inr-like elements and RY-repeats. The results provide genome-wide evidence that most microRNA genes are class-II genes and have pol II promoters, consistent with previous studies. The approach and results provide valuable insights into the regulation of microRNA gene transcription and could be useful for future studies.
This paper investigates the association between copy number variations in the DUF120 gene and symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The DUF120 gene has experienced an accelerated evolutionary expansion in the human lineage, with approximately 29 haploid copies of the protein domain within the 1q21 region. This expansion has been associated with increased neuron number and brain volume in primates. The authors found that individuals with ASD have a Gaussian distribution of DUF120 copy number, with a mean of 70 copies and a range of 56-8, similar to that in healthy individuals. They used droplet digital PCR to measure DUF120 copy number in a sample of 170 individuals with ASD and found that the mean was significantly associated with the severity of three core symptoms of ASD, including social, communication and repetitive behaviors. Increasing DUF120 copy number was found to be associated with increasing symptom severity, with each additional copy corresponding to 0.25-0.18 points on the social, communication and repetitive behavior scales. The association was not significant with cognitive measures. The findings suggest that DUF120 domain copy number, specifically the CON1 clade, has an ASD-wide effect and likely plays a key role in the pathway underlying ASD symptom severity. The authors propose that the effect may be related to the timing and rate of neurogenesis, with too many neurons produced too quickly resulting in an overabundance of poorly connected neurons. The study demonstrates that genetic variants in previously unexamined parts of the genome can contribute to complex disease phenotypes and provides a new direction for research into the genetic factors underlying ASD.
The paper investigates the origin of ale and lager yeast strains used in brewing. The authors find that these strains are polyploid and have an admixed origin between close relatives of European and Asian wine yeast strains. They inferred this through genome sequencing of 47 commercial yeast strains and analysis of 60 publicly available genomes. They identified four beer populations that are mostly composed of lager, ale, British ale, and a mixture of beer and baking strains. The beer populations are found to have admixture with a population closely related to the European wine population, indicating that early brewing technology spread yeast strains between Europe and Asia. They found evidence of gene conversion and recombination within the beer populations, which has led to genetic diversity and loss of heterozygosity. The beer strains also carry beer-specific alleles that were inherited from an ancestral population related to the European and Asian populations, but not necessarily identical to them. The study suggests that beer yeast are the products of admixture between different domesticated populations, benefiting from historical transfer of fermentation technology.
This paper investigates the serological responses to Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum antigens in three malaria-endemic sites in India. Using protein microarray technology, the study identified 638 antigens recognized with higher intensity in Indian plasma samples compared to US controls. The breadth and intensity of antibody responses were compared across different age groups and malaria statuses. Malaria-positive adults showed higher antibody responses to P. vivax antigens compared to malaria-negative adults, while malaria-negative adults showed higher responses to P. falciparum antigens. Malaria-positive children had higher antibody responses than adults. The study found that asymptomatic adults infected with P. falciparum had lower parasitemia and higher antibody responses compared to symptomatic adults, indicating that antibody-mediated immunity may play a role in controlling parasite density. However, antibody-mediated immunity against P. vivax was found to be less effective, as asymptomatic P. vivax infections were not associated with higher antibody responses. The findings suggest that antigens recognized by asymptomatic individuals may be useful for developing vaccines and surveillance tools. The study highlights the importance of understanding the complexities of the host immune response to malaria and the role of age, transmission intensity, and species prevalence in shaping the immune response.
The paper describes the sequencing and annotation of the genome of the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum. The genome was sequenced using whole genome shotgun and BAC libraries and assembled using the Atlas pipeline. The authors used automated gene prediction and manual curation to generate a comprehensive gene model set of 34604 genes. The genome was then scanned and annotated to identify transcription evidence, ESTs, contigs, and full-length cDNAs. The pea aphid genome was compared to 16 other insect genomes using a phylogenetic approach to predict orthology and paralogy relationships. Twelve percent of the aphid genes could be annotated based on one-to-one orthology with Drosophila genes and the remaining genes were annotated with GO terms based on their similarity to Drosophila genes. The authors identified four chromosomes with eight telomeres and identified transposable elements using a pipeline called REPET. The paper provides a comprehensive genomic resource for studying the aphid biology, development, and interactions with its bacterial symbionts.
This paper describes how natural genetic variation in the gene PEP1 contributes to the different flowering times among accessions of the alpine plant Arabis alpina. The PEP1 gene is an orthologue of the Arabidopsis thaliana gene FLC that regulates flowering in response to vernalization. The authors identified five accessions of A. alpina that do not require vernalization to flower and exhibit perpetual flowering, and found that these accessions carry inactive PEP1 alleles. They analyzed the PEP1 genes in these accessions and found that the PEP1 alleles contain mutations in exons 2-7 that impair protein function. The PEP1 genes in these accessions are partially duplicated, which may contribute to the complex expression patterns and broader range of tissue-specific expression. The authors conclude that loss of function alleles of PEP1 is the major source of natural variation in flowering response to vernalization in A. alpina, and that the partial duplication of the PEP1 gene may have arisen from a tandem duplication event. The paper provides evidence that flowering without vernalization and perpetual flowering provide a selective advantage in some environments, but the evolutionary forces driving the prevalence of active and inactive PEP1 alleles are not yet fully understood.
This paper describes the isolation and characterization of an antibody fragment (Fab) that specifically binds to the dengue virus NS3 protein. The Fab was identified through panning a naive human phage display library with biotinylated NS3 protein as bait. The Fab fragment 3F8 was found to have the highest binding affinity for NS3 among the isolated clones, with a KD of 10.5 nM. It specifically binds to residues 526-53 in subdomain III of the NS3 helicase domain, which is conserved across all four dengue virus serotypes. The Fab was shown to inhibit both NS3 ATPase and unwinding activities and reduce DENV replication in HEK293 cells. The authors suggest that the Fab may work by inducing conformational changes in the NS3 protein or interfering with NS3-NS5 interactions. The high affinity and specificity of the Fab make it a promising tool for studying dengue virus replication and potentially for therapeutic applications, but the difficulty of delivering antibodies intracellularly limits its clinical use.
The paper presents a study that investigates the relationship between the gut microbiome and colorectal cancer (CRC). The authors analyzed tumor exome sequencing data from 8 CRC tumors and paired normal tissue samples from the same patients, and found that the composition of the tumor microbiome is correlated with mutations in the tumor DNA. They identified specific microbial taxa that are associated with specific mutations in genes, such as APC, KRAS, and PIK3CA. They also found that microbial composition can be used to predict mutations in specific genes and pathways, such as KEGG and PID pathways. The study highlights the potential for using the microbiome as a predictor of tumor genetic profiles, which could facilitate personalized treatments. The authors note several caveats, including that they only identified correlations and cannot directly assess causal effects. They also lacked comprehensive clinical data and whole-genome sequencing.
The paper discusses how the expression of a specific gene, Vg-like A, influences the behavior of ants in terms of their division of labor. The authors found that young workers exhibit the highest expression of Vg-like A and therefore have the highest sensitivity to brood care stimuli, which leads them to take over brood care duties when new workers hatch. Older workers, on the other hand, have lower expression of Vg-like A and are more plastic in their behavior and can switch back to brood care if necessary. The expression of Vg-like A was found to down-regulate brood care behavior and accelerate behavioral progression to adult nestmate care. The authors provide evidence that the pathways involving Vg-like A are involved in mediating cue responsiveness and can either explain the preferred area a worker is seeking a job or the target of a certain behavior. They show that the transition from brood care to adult nestmate care is influenced by a gene network including Vg-like A, but the subsequent steps are not fully understood. The study provides evidence for a mechanism that explains how age-dependent behavioral progression and behavioral flexibility can be achieved at the same time. The expression of Vg-like A in the fat body controls the behavioral progression, suggesting that future research should focus on other tissues and their communication in addition to the brain. The findings provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying division of labor in social insects.
This paper proposes a neural model of coordinated eye and head movements during saccades. The model consists of a feedforward control pathway and an adaptation mechanism to adapt the neural controller based on a cost function that minimizes the total gaze error. The cost function does not directly penalize the gaze shift duration, allowing for gradient-based optimization and learning of the controller. This allows the model to adapt to generate neural command signals for coordinated eye and head movements during head-free gaze shifts, where the head movement is free to move. The model is able to reproduce key characteristics of coordinated eye and head movements, such as the increase in head contribution with larger gaze shifts and the ability to reproduce velocity profiles for different saccades. The authors speculate that the adaptation signals may come from the cerebellum or the superior colliculus, but more experimental evidence is needed to confirm this. The model provides a step towards a biologically realistic implementation of saccadic eye movements and could be generalized to other ballistic motor control tasks.
This paper compared the effectiveness and safety of the fluoroquinolones ofloxacin and gatifloxacin for the treatment of enteric fever in an area with a high proportion of nalidixic acid-resistant Salmonella Typhi and S. Paratyphi A isolates. The study found that while ofloxacin was effective in treating enteric fever caused by nalidixic acid-resistant isolates, it had longer fever clearance times than gatifloxacin. The study included 627 patients with culture-confirmed enteric fever and 10 blood culture positive patients. The results showed that while ofloxacin was effective, it had a higher failure rate, defined as persistent fever at day 10 or need for rescue treatment, relapse, complications and microbiological failure. Gatifloxacin had a lower failure rate and faster fever clearance time, defined as fever clearance time of less than 3.3 days compared to 4.7 days for ofloxacin. The study suggests that gatifloxacin may be a better option for young, otherwise healthy patients with enteric fever in resource poor settings where ofloxacin is commonly used. However, the study had limitations, such as open-label design and lack of severe cases, and high faecal carriage after treatment. Overall, the study suggests that adequately-dosed gatifloxacin or ofloxacin would be effective empirically treating undifferentiated fever in resource poor settings where nalidixic acid-resistance is common, while the convenience and faster symptom resolution of gatifloxacin may make it a better option for young patients.
The paper explores the role of host population structure and resistance in the endemism of the bubonic plague in Madagascar. The authors develop a mathematical model to study how these factors contribute to the persistence of the disease in natural foci. They find that, without resistance, the disease cannot persist in large host populations, except for a narrow range of values of the transmission parameter. However, including resistance in the model allows the disease to persist in smaller populations, even when the host population size is above the critical threshold for propagation. This suggests that resistance may play a key role in maintaining the disease in endemism. They also find that population subdivision, or spatial structure, can allow the disease to persist in smaller populations, as long as there is a certain level of coupling between subpopulations. They argue that the persistence of plague in Madagascar may be due to a combination of these factors, with host population structure allowing the disease to persist for a duration depending on the degree of spatial structure and the features of the host and flea populations, while resistance may allow a stable persistence in the highlands. The authors suggest that the evolution of resistance in the highlands may have maintained the disease endemism in this area. Further field studies are needed to test the assumptions and better estimate the parameters in Madagascar, particularly the flea populations.
The paper discusses how the spatio-temporal structure of the brain's connectome, including time delays and heterogeneities, affects the phase relations between distant brain regions. The authors use a Kuramoto model to analyze the phase locking and lag between nodes in synchronized oscillators, showing that the organization of time delays and coupling strengths determines whether the synchronization is in- or anti-phase, and the topology of the network determines the sign of the phase lag. They validate their findings with simulations of a realistic brain connectome, demonstrating that phase lags during synchronization depend on the time delays and coupling strength, and frequency mismatch. They find that stronger nodes lag behind weaker nodes during in-phase synchronization, and anti-phase synchronization, and that phase lags between hemispheres are around 0 or ±π. The results show that the spatio-temporal structure of the connectome imposes the architecture of phase lags and that accounting for the network dynamics is a more realistic approach, especially when coherence is not insignificant. However, the complexity of the connectome, including the distribution of time delays and weights, limits the predictability of the analysis and the interpretation of phase-locking indices. The study highlights the importance of considering the underlying network dynamics and properties of the brain connectivity, beyond just the average coupling strength and frequency, to better understand brain function and synchronization.
The paper describes how three mutations in the hepatitis C virus (HCV) genome can enable it to use mouse CD81 as an entry factor instead of human CD81, allowing it to infect mouse cells. The authors used reverse genetics to create mouse cell lines that express human CD81, CD81, or mouse CD81, and analyzed the effects of these mutations on HCV infection. They found that the mutations in the E1 and E2 proteins of HCV that were selected to use mouse CD81 increased the efficiency of infection by 10-fold compared to using human CD81. The mutations did not affect the ability of HCV to use human CD81. The mutations also reduced the dependence of HCV on SR-BI, OCLN, and CD81, indicating that the mouse CD81 binding site was more accessible. The authors propose that these mutations likely result in an open conformation of the viral surface proteins that exposes the CD81 binding site, allowing interaction with mouse CD81. This facilitates conformational changes that enable the virus to utilize mouse CD81 for entry. The study suggests that a limited number of mutations can be sufficient to adapt HCV to use foreign host factors, potentially leading to the development of immune-competent small animal models for HCV research.
The paper discusses the identification of two cellular kinases, Pim-1 and Pim-3, as regulators of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) reactivation. The authors found that Pim-1 and -3 are required for KSHV reactivation in both latently infected endothelial cells and naturally infected PEL cells. They demonstrate that Pim-1 and -3 kinases interact with and phosphorylate the latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) in reactivated cells, counteracting LANA-mediated repression of transcription from the transcriptional enhancer region. This phosphorylation of LANA is necessary for the reactivation of KSHV lytic genes. The authors also show that expression of Pim-1 and -3 kinases is induced by cytokines such as interferon-gamma, which can stimulate KSHV reactivation in PEL cells. Silencing of Pim-1 and -3 expression inhibits KSHV reactivation, indicating that these kinases play a critical role in the reactivation process. The findings suggest that Pim kinases could be a potential target for therapeutic intervention to treat KSHV-malignancies.
The paper describes a new role for the protein Lab-1 in regulating sister chromatid cohesion during meiosis in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. The authors found that depletion of Lab-1 leads to reduced sister chromatid cohesion and an increase in recombination intermediates, indicating that Lab-1 plays an important role in maintaining the cohesin complex during early prophase I. They showed that Lab-1 is required for proper loading and maintenance of the cohesin complex, and that it acts in parallel with the core cohesin subunits Rec8, Coh-4 and Coh-3. The authors propose that Lab-1 targets the phosphatase PP1 to chromosome axes, restricting the ability of the protein Aurora B kinase to remove cohesin, thus promoting sister chromatid cohesion. They also found that Lab-1 localization is partially dependent on the cohesin complex, and that the loss of Lab-1 on long arms leads to unchecked AIR-2 loading. This suggests that Lab-1 acts to establish and maintain sister chromatid cohesion in cooperation with the cohesin complex during early prophase I, and that it is required for proper chromosome segregation during meiosis.
The paper challenges the traditional model that massive heterochromatinization occurs during cellular differentiation, specifically an increase in repressive histone marks like H3K9me2, to specify cell type and lose plasticity. The authors show that H3K9me2 is already highly prevalent in embryonic stem cells and only shows a slight increase during differentiation. The increase is localized to gene bodies and does not necessarily coincide with lower expression of the corresponding genes. They find that the actual number of low-level expressed genes is similar between stem cells and differentiated cells, contradicting the idea that stem cells have a higher number of highly expressed genes. RNA sequencing shows that the transcriptomes of stem cells and differentiated cells are similar, with a small fraction of genes being expressed at low levels. The results suggest that repressive chromatin is already highly active in stem cells and that epigenome reprogramming involves localized changes of repressive histone modifications and DNA methylation at regulatory regions, rather than massive transcriptome reprogramming. The findings support a model where repressive chromatin is active in stem cells and specific lineage specification and terminal differentiation are safeguarded through local differences.
The paper presents results from three experiments that investigate how people integrate evidence over a duration of 1-3 seconds to make decisions. The experiments show that people exhibit a non-monotonic temporal weighting profile, where early evidence is more influential than later evidence. This is inconsistent with existing computational models that predict monotonic temporal weights. The authors propose a new model called the dynamic leaky competing accumulator (DLA), which can account for the non-monotonic temporal weights observed. The DLA model has two attractor states and leak and inhibition parameters that change over time. As time progresses, the model becomes more recency-biased, leading to non-monotonic weights. The DLA model can predict both primacy-biased weights for shorter durations and recency-biased weights for longer durations, consistent with the observed results. The authors argue that this non-monotonic temporal weighting profile poses a challenge for existing models and highlights the need for new models that can account for this complex behavior.
The paper investigates the role of alveolar macrophages (AM) and monocytes in the pathogenesis of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) H5N1 infection in humans. The authors compare the infection of AM and MM from bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) and peripheral blood monocytes in vitro and in vivo. They find that HPAIV infects AM more efficiently than MM, and that AM do not induce excessive cytokine production compared to MM. This suggests that the AM may play a role in limiting the severity of HPAIV infection. The AM are more abundantly infected by HPAIV than seasonal H3N2 or pH1N1 virus, which may contribute to the high pathogenicity of HPAIV. However, the authors note that monocytes that enter the lungs during HPAIV infection may respond differently than the AM. The results suggest that MM are not suitable to study the interaction between AM and HPAIV, and that the AM may play a protective role in limiting the severity of HPAIV infection. The study highlights the differences in the AM and MM phenotype that may affect their responses to different influenza viruses.
The paper describes a genome-scale RNA interference (RNAi) screen to identify genes that are involved in homologous recombination repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSB). The screen used a stable HeLa cell line with a GFP reporter that becomes active only after DSBs are repaired via homologous recombination. The RNAi library contained over 1600 genes targeted by short hairpin RNAs. The screen identified 61 genes that significantly affected the frequency of GFP-positive cells in the DR-GFP assay, which indicated that they were involved in homologous recombination. The authors used bioinformatics and structural analysis to identify a novel gene, KIAA0415, which they found to be a putative helicase that was associated with spastic paraplegia. They showed that knockdown of KIAA0415 resulted in reduced GFP-positive cells in the DR-GFP assay and that mutations in KIAA0415 were associated with spastic paraplegia in two patient families. They propose that KIAA0415 is required for homologous recombination and that mutations in KIAA041 may contribute to hereditary spastic paraplegia. The findings provide a potential new link between hereditary spastic paraplegia and DNA repair deficiencies, and suggest that RNAi screens can be used to identify novel genes involved in DNA repair.
The paper presents a proof-of-concept study using 16S metagenomics to identify bacteria in the blood of severely ill children in Burkina Faso. The study found that 16S metagenomics had a higher sensitivity than blood culture in detecting bacterial bloodstream infections (BSI), particularly in patients who had used antibiotics prior to blood collection. The authors suggest that residual antibiotics in the blood may inhibit bacterial growth during blood culture, while 16S metagenomics is entirely based on bacterial DNA detection. They found that patients with acute or recent malaria history were more likely to carry multiple bacterial species in their blood, which was associated with a higher risk of poor clinical outcome. The study suggests that malaria may contribute to the development of bacterial bloodstream infections, possibly by increasing gut permeability or impairing spleen function. The 16S metagenomics approach provides an assumption-free method to identify bacteria and detect multiple species in a single run, but has some limitations due to sample collection and PCR bias. The results suggest that 16S metagenomics has the potential to revolutionize the diagnosis of BSI in resource-limited settings and surveillance studies.
The paper discusses the potential benefits of using vector control in addition to case detection and treatment for controlling Gambian HAT (Gambian sleeping sickness) in sub-Saharan Africa. The disease is caused by two parasites transmitted by tsetse flies and is normally restricted to sub-Saharan Africa. While case detection and treatment has been successful in controlling outbreaks, it does not eliminate the disease and fails to protect people from becoming infected. The paper argues that vector control could play a significant role in reducing the tsetse population to below the threshold required for transmission, thus halting HAT transmission. The authors found that riverine tset flies are more susceptible to small targets and can be deployed at lower densities than previously thought, reducing the tset population by up to 90% within three months. They estimate that a vector control operation would need to be maintained for about five years to achieve this goal, starting at the beginning of the dry season when tset populations are at their lowest. They suggest organizing vector control at the HAT focus level, working closely with local health structures and providing training and support. While the effectiveness of the targets may decrease over time, the fly population will not completely recover, suggesting that external support is needed initially but can be tapered off over time. The authors conclude that the inclusion of vector control alongside case detection and treatment could significantly improve HAT control.
The paper describes an extension of the CE-Symm tool that can detect and analyze internal symmetry in proteins, beyond just closed or open symmetry. The new version can identify and describe multiple levels of internal symmetry, including hierarchical symmetries and higher-order point groups. It can also recursively detect multiple axes of symmetry in a protein structure to identify higher-order symmetries. The tool can identify corresponding residues and symmetry operations between repeats. The alignments of the repeats are useful for identifying conserved and differential features and understanding protein function and evolution. However, the tool is limited in that it does not yet integrate quaternary symmetry detection and cannot detect symmetry in structures with conformational changes or non-sequential rearrangements. The authors hypothesize that the prevalence of internal symmetry in proteins is likely due to the benefit of conserving interfaces between repeats, but further research is needed to determine whether it is a thermodynamic or evolutionary selection. The tool has been integrated into the BioJava library and is available on GitHub.
The paper investigates the relationship between histone acetylation and gene expression in embryonic stem cells during differentiation. The authors analyze the internal structure of histone acetylation profiles and find that the location of acetylation islands remains stable, while differentially down-regulated genes are accompanied by a stronger loss of acetylation than up-regulated genes. They show that the correlation between histone acetylation and gene expression increases over time, indicating that changes in chromatin structure may induce changes in gene expression. They also find that key regulatory genes show high levels of acetylation profiles, which get reduced more strongly than other genes over time. They conclude that histone acetylation is predictive of gene expression changes, especially for pluripotency genes, but the relationship between histone acetylation and gene expression changes is complex and may involve mechanisms beyond transcriptional regulation. The results suggest that histone acetylation may play a role in non-transcriptional regulation of pluripotency genes, and that changes in chromatin structure may occur before gene expression changes become visible. The findings provide insights into the multilayer regulatory mechanisms that determine stem cell fate.
The paper presents a model of how bacterial cells evolve the ability to attach to surfaces, known as adhesive cells. The model shows that the ability to attach to surfaces allows bacteria to colonize surfaces and form colonies, but this comes at a cost of reduced cell division rates. The model demonstrates how bacteria can evolve different strategies to differentiate into adhesive cells, with different trade-offs between surface colonization and division rates. The model shows that different strategies lead to different life cycles, with surface colonization being the dominant life stage for most cases. The paper argues that the ability of bacteria to form colonies on surfaces allows them to organize themselves and coordinate their behavior, which facilitates their survival and reproduction. The ability to attach to surfaces also makes bacteria vulnerable to exploitation by cells from the liquid. The model shows that the environment plays a key role in shaping the evolution of these adhesive cell types and life cycles, as different environmental conditions can influence the ability of bacteria to coordinate their behavior and form colonies.
The paper discusses a new mechanism of DNA methylation in the fungus Neurospora crassa called disiRNA-induced DNA methylation (DLDM). Unlike known DNA methylation in Neurospora, DLDM occurs in gene-rich regions lacking repetitive elements and is highly dynamic, dependent on transcription at disiRNA loci and is triggered by convergent transcription. DLDM requires the histone methyltransfer DIM-5 for maintenance, but is not required for maintenance of H3K9 methylation. DLDM is also dependent on transcription at promoter regions where disiRNA expression peaks. Convergent transcription of disiRNAs appears to be the reason for DLDM. Transcription at promoter regions may be necessary for the establishment of DNA methylation and DLDM. The study shows that DLDM is on/off and dynamic, involving both induction and demethylation processes. It differs substantially from known DNA methylation in RIP-induced regions. The authors suggest that a complex interaction between ends of the gene for transcription initiation and termination may be involved in DLDM.
The paper discusses the impaired function of dendritic cells (DC) in individuals infected with Schistosoma haematobium, a blood fluke. The study found that circulating DC in infected individuals have reduced frequencies and numbers compared to healthy controls. DC from infected individuals showed impaired responses to TLR ligands, including reduced expression of HLA-DR and CD80, and reduced cytokine production. The study suggests that this impaired function may be due to a general deficit in pro-inflammatory signaling rather than TLR expression, as evidenced by reduced p38 activation in response to LPS. This impaired function of DC leads to an impaired ability to prime T cell responses, resulting in reduced T cell activation and cytokine production. The study concludes that chronic Schistosoma infection likely modulates DC function through direct interactions with DC-derived antigens, and that impaired DC function during chronic infections may have consequences for immunity against concurrent infections, especially those from bacterial or viral origin that rely on TLR-driven APC activation.
This paper describes a new approach for understanding the within-host evolution of the influenza virus within a single infected host, based on time-resolved sequence data. The authors use a quasispecies model of viral evolution and a hierarchical set of potential models of selection to identify the evolutionary scenario that best explains the observed sequence data. They account for linkage disequilibrium between alleles at different loci, which is difficult to do with single-locus models. The approach allows for both synonymous and non-synonymous mutations to be identified as under selection, and weak selection acting upon synonymous mutations has been observed. The results show selection acting upon both synonymous and non-synonymous mutations, and the timing of selection may be influenced by immune response. The method assumes a large viral population in the host, deterministic evolution, and relatively accurate sequence data. However, the results are limited by the availability of data and the potential for sequencing bias. The approach could be used to infer the role of selection for transmission, but transmission events are not explicitly considered in the current study. Overall, the paper demonstrates a useful framework for characterizing within-host viral evolution, which will be valuable for understanding the epidemiology of influenza and other RNA viruses.
This paper estimates the impact of scaling up interventions to prevent malaria in pregnant women, specifically insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and intermittent preventive treatment with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPTp) to prevent malaria in areas where there is resistance to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP). The authors analyze the current coverage of these interventions and estimate that only 21.6% of pregnancies at risk of malaria in Africa received two or more doses of IPTpSP in 2015, despite high coverage of antenatal care (ANC) visits. They also estimate that 7.1 million pregnancies occurred in areas where SP efficacy remained high despite ANC attendance, representing 16000 potential low birth weight (LBW) deliveries that could have been prevented if IPTpSP was provided to all women at least three times during pregnancy. The authors suggest that scaling up IPTpSP coverage would likely prevent 215,000 potential LBW deliveries in areas where SP efficacy remains high, even if SP resistance has developed, and that providing IPTpSP to women who attend ANC at least three times should be a public health priority. However, they acknowledge that their assumptions about the relationship between SP efficacy and LBW may be conservative and that there is limited data on how SP efficacy affects LBW in areas of high transmission. They argue that improving IPTpSP coverage would be a cost-effective way to reduce malaria-related low birth weight births, but more work is needed to monitor and understand the impact of SP resistance on IPTpSP efficacy and develop alternatives to SP.
The paper presents the results of a genome-wide association study of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common endocrine disorder in women. The study identified 14 genetic loci associated with PCOS, including three novel loci, using a meta-analysis of 10,074 cases and 103,164 controls across seven European ancestry cohorts. The results suggest that there is no significant difference in the genetic architecture of PCOS across the different diagnostic criteria of NIH, non-NIH Rotterdam and self-reported diagnosis. The most strongly associated locus, GATA4/NEIL2, was found to be different across the different criteria. The loci associated with PCOS traits, such as hyperandrogenism, oligomenorrhoea, and polycystic ovarian morphology, were found to be the same across the different criteria. The study found genetic correlations with male pattern balding and depression, suggesting that PCOS has shared genetic underpinnings with metabolic and reproductive disorders. The findings demonstrate the power of genetic and genomic approaches to elucidate the pathophysiology of PCOS, and provide insights into the causal genetic loci and biological pathways involved.
The paper investigates the role of the protein SsbB in Streptococococcus pneumoniae, a gram-positive bacterium that can transform its genome through recombination. The authors find that SsbB plays a direct role in stabilizing internalized single-stranded DNA, which is important when high concentrations of exogenous DNA are present. This allows S. pneumoniae cells to cope with high DNA loads. They propose that the evolutionary reason for SsbB's abundance is to maintain a reservoir of internalized DNA, which increases the likelihood of multiple recombination events in the same cell. This allows the formation of new combinations of mutations and contributes to the genetic plasticity of the species. SsbB inactivation reduces the stability of internalized DNA and lowers transformation frequencies, while SsbBΔ7 stabilizes DNA and increases transformation frequencies, suggesting that SsbB plays a protective role. The findings suggest that SsbB plays a specific role in optimizing chromosomal transformation, particularly at high DNA concentrations. The authors conclude that SsbB is important for allowing S. pneumoniae to cope with high DNA loads and maintain genetic plasticity.
This paper discusses the role of siderophores in the fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigus in causing disease in humans. The authors identified four genes involved in siderophore biosynthesis, sidC, sidD, sidF, and sidG, and found that both intracellular and extracellular siderophores are required for full virulence in the fungus. They found that the conidial siderophore Hydroxyferrocin (HFC) is derived from ferric iron and is required for conidial iron storage. The extracellular siderophore TAFC is required for efficient sporulation, while the intracellular siderophore FC is required for efficient germ tube formation. The loss of intracellular siderophores leads to reduced growth under iron-depleted conditions and increased sensitivity to oxidative stress, while the loss of extracellular siderophores only partially attenuates virulence. The partial attenuation of virulence following supplementation with HFC suggests that the conidial siderophore is important for the initial phase of infection. The intracellular siderophore is required for optimal iron storage and possibly iron distribution, while the extracellular siderophore is required for hyphal growth under iron limitation. The results demonstrate that both intracellular and extracellular siderophores play distinct roles in maintaining iron homeostasis and virulence in A. fumigatus, and highlight the potential for siderophores as a basis for therapy.
The paper discusses how the transcriptional regulator LexA in Escherichia coli controls the timing of gene expression in response to environmental stress, specifically DNA damage, by modulating the binding kinetics of the repressor protein to promoters. The authors used a GFP transcription reporter system to measure promoter activity over a wide dose-range of UV damage and found that the timing of peak activity varies significantly between genes, indicating non-equilibrium dynamics. They engineered synthetic promoters with different LexA-operator binding kinetics and measured their promoter activity to show that the rate at which LexA dissociates from the promoter determines the timing of peak activity, not just the concentration of LexA. This single transcription factor, through its interactions with the operator, can control the timing of promoter activity across a large network of genes as a function of the amount of DNA damage. The study demonstrates how a kinetic model, rather than a thermodynamic model, provides a more accurate framework for understanding how a single transcription factor can control the timing of gene expression in response to environmental stimuli. The findings highlight the importance of studying kinetic parameters rather than equilibrium parameters and provide insights into how a single transcription factor can modulate the timing of expression across an entire gene network.
The paper describes the results of experimental infections of magpies (a common European corvid) with West Nile virus (WNV) isolates from Europe, demonstrating that magpies are highly susceptible to infection and can act as a source of transmission for both horizontal and vertical transmission of the virus. Inoculating magpies with two different WNV lineages resulted in high mortality rates of 30% and 42.8% for the two isolates, respectively, with surviving birds showing significant weight loss and the development of neutralizing antibodies. Magpies were found to have high viremia levels and detectable WNV in their feathers and cloacal swabs, indicating they could act as a source of transmission to mosquitoes and other hosts. The authors conclude that magpies are a likely source of WNV transmission in Europe and should be targeted in surveillance programs, given their high susceptibility and ability to amplify the virus. The results suggest that magpies may play a key role in maintaining the virus' enzootic cycle in Europe, particularly during winter when mosquito populations are reduced.
The paper describes a mouse model of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection that mimics human disease. The authors used mice deficient in various immune responses (B cells, T cells, or both B and T cells) to investigate the role of these immune cells in controlling CHIKV viraemia and the development of arthritis. They found that while antibodies and T cells play some role in suppressing viraemia, the main factor limiting viraemia is B cell deficiency. Vaccination with an inactivated CHIKV vaccine provided protection against viraemia and arthritis in B cell-deficient mice. However, adoptive transfer of anti-CHIKV antibodies could only clear viraemia temporarily in these mice, suggesting that robust antibody responses alone are not enough to eliminate persistent CHIKV infection. Persistent CHIKV RNA was found to be present in tissues of infected mice, suggesting that ongoing immune responses may be involved in maintaining chronic inflammation. The study highlights the role of CD4 T cells in controlling viraemia and suggests that the persistent CHIKV RNA likely represents ongoing viral replication rather than just a residual material from active infection. The mouse model provides insights into the mechanisms of chronic CHIKV infection and may be useful for developing prophylactic and therapeutic interventions.
The paper proposes a novel method called SELDOM to infer signaling pathway networks and make dynamic predictions from experimental data. SELDOM generates an ensemble of dynamic models by combining information theory, global optimization, and model reduction. SELDOM infers a family of plausible networks from experimental data and uses them to train an ensemble of logic-based models. The models are then optimized to minimize the difference between the predictions and experimental data. The ensemble predictions are shown to be more robust and accurate than individual model predictions for most case studies, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in some cases, especially when applied to untested experimental conditions. The proposed method provides mechanistic models that can simulate complex time-varying situations and guide experimental design, and biological hypotheses. The SELDOM pipeline is flexible and can be adapted to any signaling or regulatory dataset. The choice of ensemble size and maximum in-degree parameter can be tuned.
The paper derives and analyzes the linear response of a neuron model capable of exhibiting resonance, called the Gauss-Rice GIF neuron. The model consists of a voltage dynamics that is coupled to an intrinsic variable w, and spiking dynamics that is triggered by the voltage. The linear response function is derived using the complex response vector, which is then related to the ensemble-averaged response vector. This allows for the computation of the dynamic gain of the neuron, which quantifies the amount by which input features are amplified or attenuated in the output spiking. The authors show that the dynamic gain constrains the neuron's signal processing capabilities and can be used to study the connection between intrinsic properties and population oscillations. They find six distinct filter shapes in the response function depending on the resonance condition, and show how the high and low pass nature of the filter depends on the intrinsic time constants and the frequency of the input. They demonstrate the validity of the model by comparing the analytical results to numerical simulations and experiments. The results provide a complete analysis of the linear response properties of the Gauss-Rice GIF neuron model, which can be used to study the connection between intrinsic properties and population oscillations.
This paper analyzed the tick salivary gland transcriptome of the hard tick species Ixodes ricinus following infection with the bacterial pathogen Bartonella hensela. The study found that 5.5% of the identified genes varied in their expression level during in response to infection, including 62% that were up-regulated and 38% that were down-regulated. Most of the up-regulated genes encoded proteins with BPTI/Kunitz domains, which are known to modulate blood feeding and bacterial infection in ticks. One such gene, IrSPI, was found to be significantly up-regulated and was silenced using RNA interference. This resulted in a reduction in bacterial load within the salivary glands and a decrease in tick weight, suggesting that IrSPI may be a promising candidate for an anti-tick vaccine. The study highlights the existence of co-evolutionary mechanisms between ticks and pathogens and provides insights into the molecular interactions between them. The findings demonstrate the potential of using next-generation sequencing technologies to identify tick genes involved in transmission and provide a reference database for future research. The study also suggests that vaccines targeting key tick factors may be effective in reducing both tick burden and transmission of pathogens, representing a major improvement over current control measures.
The paper describes a 6-year retrospective study of patients with chronic rheumatic disorders following a chikungunya infection in Reunion Island. The study found that patients with persistent pain and stiffness after chikungunya infection, lasting more than 4 months, were classified as chikungunya-related musculoskeletal disorders (pCHIK-MSD). The study identified three subtypes of pCHIK-MSD: crystalline arthritis, chikungunya-related inflammatory rheumatism (CIR), and undifferentiated pCHIK-MSD. The patients were found to have joint pain and stiffness, synovitis, tenosynovitis, and enthesitis, and peripheral joint inflammation. The study found that 70% of patients had joint damage and 50% had chondrolysis. The majority of patients were female, and most patients had psoriatic or pseudo-psoriatic polyarthritis. The study highlighted the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of pCHIK-CIR to prevent joint damage. The study found that patients with pre-existing chronic rheumatoid arthritis were more likely to have joint destruction and functional impairment. The study suggests that chikungunya may trigger inflammation in susceptible individuals and that local inflammation in synovium and tendons may lead to degeneration of joints and muscles. The study recommends early serology to confirm chikungunya infection and individualized treatment based on the patient's clinical presentation.
The paper presents a dynamic network representation of protein fold space to capture variations in its organization resulting from different alignment methods and threshold levels. While many different techniques have been applied to visualize the global protein universe, the authors argue that ensuring robustness to alignment methodology is important. Using four different alignment methods and consensus networks, the authors show that while there are some disagreements in where bridges between different folds lie, the networks generally converge on the main secondary structure classes and whether folds are connected or unconnected. The central nodes in the networks tend to be older, indicating that key folds have ancestral origins. The authors identify four highly central pivotal folds with distinct structural features and argue that these folds represent the core of the global fold space, which is different from the previously identified functionally diverse core. The core folds are not dominated by ancient α/β structures, but rather span the four SCOP classes. The study highlights the importance of considering structural bridges between folds as a potential encoding of evolutionary information.
The paper discusses how the protozoan parasite Leishmania uses its surface coat to infect phagocytic cells and establish infection. The surface coat of metacyclic promastigotes (the transitional form between promastigotes and amastigotes) is composed of two virulence factors, LPG and GP63. These molecules are shed from the surface of internalized promastigotes and redistribute to the cytosol of infected cells via a mechanism involving vesicular trafficking between the phagosome and endoplasmic reticulum. The study found that LPG and GP63 are present in fractions 2-8 of sucrose gradients of infected macrophages, indicating that they sediment with lipid rafts and endoplasmic reticulum proteins. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that LPG and GP63 colocalize with ERGIC proteins, indicating they are exported from the phagosome through the endoplasmic reticulum. The ER/ERGIC-resident SNARE Sec2b is required for the redistribution of LPG and GP63 beyond the phagosome. Disruption of the Sec2b-dependent transport pathway between the phagosome and endoplasmic reticulum abrogated the exit of LPG and GP63 from the phagosome, suggesting that this pathway is the mechanism by which they are transported beyond the phagosome. This mechanism may provide a mechanistic explanation for the localization of LPG at the nuclear envelope of infected cells. The study suggests that Leishmania uses vesicular trafficking between the phagosome and endoplasmic reticulum to transport virulence factors beyond the phagosome, rather than exosomes.
The paper describes the results of a study that aimed to identify the cellular mechanisms that regulate the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) in mitosis. The authors found that the Greatwall kinase/Mastl->PP2A/B5 pathway regulates the activity of the protein MPS1, which is required for robust SAC maintenance. Mastl knockout mice and MEFs exhibited a premature SAC silencing, resulting in mitotic defects. The authors identified MPS1 as a target of the Cdk1-PP2A/B5 pathway and showed that Cdk1 phosphorylation of MPS1 is required for full MPS1 activity and SAC maintenance. The MPS1 activity was found to decrease in Mastl knockout MEFs, which resulted in mitotic defects. The authors propose that Mastl regulates the PP2A/B5 activity to prevent premature dephosphorylation of MPS1, allowing the SAC to be maintained until chromosomes are properly aligned during mitosis.
This paper discusses the role of a gene called cyp26b1 in the development of the musculoskeletal system of the zebrafish head. The authors discovered a mutant allele called cyp26b1b102 that resulted in muscle defects and midline skeletal abnormalities. They found that cyp26b1b102 mutants had defects in muscle attachments, including ectopic muscle projections and abnormal tendon development. They found that cyp26b1b102 mutants had a disorganized muscle phenotype, with muscle fibers often splitting from the main mass and extending ectopically. They showed that cyp26b1b102 mutants had defects in tendon development, including a failure to condense tenoblasts at the mandibuloid junction, which is a key musculoskelet integration site. They propose that cyp26b1b102 functions in a neural crest population outside of tenoblasts to promote tenoblast condensation, which is required for proper muscle patterning. They conclude that signals from neural crest cells are critical for promoting specific sites of tendon condensation, which then organize the musculature. The results suggest that cyp26b1b102 mutants have cranial muscles that maintain tenoblast populations but these muscles are not sufficient for tendon differentiation in the absence of the neural crest cells.
This paper estimates the relationship between dog vaccination, dog and human rabies cases, and exposure reporting and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) usage in Latin America during the period 195-2005. The authors use a panel regression model to account for intertemporal dynamics and endogeneity issues. They find that: 1) Vaccinations reduce dog rabies cases, but not PEP usage initially. However, over time, vaccinations lead to increased PEP usage, as people perceive rabies risk and demand PEP more. 2) Reported exposures increase with dog rabies cases and human rabies cases, driven by awareness and salience of rabies as a risk. 3) PEP usage reduces human rabies cases, but not initially. 4) Per capita income affects PEP usage and is positively related to PEP usage. The findings suggest that while vaccination reduces dog rabies, PEP demand is driven by rabies awareness and income. Integrated bite case management approaches that include clinical assessment and treatment of exposures are needed to reduce false positives and negatives. The study highlights the importance of evaluating human exposure data and PEP usage relative to dog vaccination to achieve rabies elimination goals, particularly for low- and middle-income countries.
This paper describes a new mouse model of ovarian cancer that was created by conditionally deleting the estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) gene in the pituitary gland but not in the ovary. The resulting mice, called ERαd mice, exhibit a high level of estrogen production due to loss of negative feedback regulation by the pituitary. The ERαd mice develop palpable ovarian tumors that grow with age, indicating that elevated estrogen levels play a role in the initiation and progression of ovarian cancer. The tumors are composed of both epithelial and stromal cells and exhibit characteristics of high-grade serous ovarian cancer, including the expression of genes associated with serous ovarian cancer. Treatment with the anti-estrogen drug letrozole inhibits the growth of the tumors, indicating that estrogen signaling is required for their development. The authors propose that local estrogen production within the tumors, rather than ovarian cell surface epithelial cells, is the key factor in promoting tumorigenesis. The study provides evidence that estrogen signaling, particularly in the ovary, plays an important role in the development of epithelial ovarian tumors.
This paper investigates the role of the gene Phlda2 in the placenta in prenatal programming of maternal care behavior in mice. The researchers found that exposure to a lower dose of the Phlda2 gene in the offspring resulted in increased maternal care behavior in the mother, including more crouched nursing and grooming, while exposure to a higher dose resulted in decreased maternal care. This suggests that the offspring can influence the maternal care the mother will provide even before birth by modulating the expression of the Phlda2 gene in the placenta. The findings support the idea that the paternal genome can influence maternal investment, which is consistent with the idea that 'paternalization' should result in increased maternal care. The study provides evidence for the prenatal programming of maternal behavior through the placenta and highlights the potential role of placental lactogens in this process. The results also have implications for human health, as elevated placental PHLDA2 has been linked to mood disorders in pregnancy. Overall, the study demonstrates that the placenta plays an important role in shaping maternal behavior and that the imprinting of genes in the offspring can influence maternal care, even in mice.
This paper uses molecular dynamics simulations to study the packing of helices in the protein immunoglobulin 9 (Im9) to understand the physical basis of molecular recognition. The authors find that Im9 has significant frustration in its helix-helix interactions, where non-native helix-helix interactions are favored over native interactions. They identify that the native folding of Im9 is favored despite this frustration due to the involvement of other parts of the protein, particularly helix 4 and its flanking residues. They propose that favorable non-native interactions can be largely suppressed during Im9 folding by favoring trajectories that assemble helices in the presence of other parts of the protein. The study provides insights into the physical basis of molecular recognition mechanisms, highlighting the importance of considering disordered conformations and conformational switches. However, the current force fields used in the simulations are limited in their ability to accurately model disordered protein states and subtle effects, suggesting that further work is needed to fully decipher the physical basis of molecular recognition.
The paper examines how microclimate variation in urban, suburban and rural areas affects the Aedes albopictus mosquito, which is a vector for dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses. The authors found that mosquitoes in urban areas experience warmer temperatures and lower humidity compared to rural areas. This leads to lower larval survival, smaller adult size and lower per capita growth rates. However, the effects of temperature and humidity on mosquito traits differ between summer and fall seasons. In the hot summer, lower daily minimum temperatures and higher relative humidity reduce adult emergence, while in the cooler fall, higher daily maximum temperatures increase adult emergence. The variation in mosquito body size and transmission potential across land use and seasons provides a framework for estimating the relative importance of environmental and mosquito-pathogen parameters on transmission potential. The study highlights how subtle variations in microclimate can lead to appreciable differences in mosquito life history traits and transmission potential. However, the authors note that other factors like quantity and quality of larval and adult habitats, access to hosts, insecticide use and human behavior will also influence transmission risk. The results demonstrate the need for more realistic laboratory studies that capture the activity space and transmission environments experienced by mosquitoes, as local climate data does not accurately represent the microclimate mosquitoes experience.
The paper describes the structure of the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) capsid protein at the electron microscopy resolution of 6 and 9 angstroms. The capsid protein is composed of four major proteins: MCP, mCP, mC-B and SCP, and the smallest protein, SCP. The authors used a ribozyme to specifically inhibit the expression of SCP in infected cells and observed that the resulting particles lack the genome-containing DNA and are non-infectious. This indicates that SCP is essential for the binding of pp150 to the capsid, which is mediated by a specific interaction between pp150 and the SCP protein. The authors also observed that the absence of SCP prevents the formation of the DNA-filled capsid, suggesting that SCP is required for the functional binding of pp150 to the capsid. The small size and essential function of SCP in HCMV suggests that it may provide a potential target for intervention against HCMV infection. The authors propose designing SCP-mimicking peptides that act as competitive inhibitors of pp150 binding and functioning, thus preventing infectious virus formation.
The paper proposes a computational model that describes how the mechanical interactions between cells within a confined space, gene expression and cell division help shape the early mammalian embryo. The model includes a blastocyst consisting of cells with a fluid-filled cavity, and an ellipsoidal pellucid zone. The cells express genes that determine their lineage, such as Cdx2, Oct4, Nanog and Gata6. The model shows how cell divisions, gene expression and mechanical interactions affect the positioning of cells within the blastocyst, leading to the formation of the trophectoderm and endoderm layers. The authors test two hypotheses for how cells in the inner cell mass become part of the trophectoderm lineage: a "position-based" model where inner cells have lower Cdx2 expression and outer cells have higher Cdx2, and a "polarity-based" model where cell division patterns are regulated by Cdx2 levels. The simulations show that the position-based model is more robust and consistent with experimental data. The model also considers how the endoderm layer forms through differential adhesion between cells, with the blastocoel providing a directional force to guide Gata6 cells. The authors propose experiments to test which mechanism the embryo actually employs to form the endoderm layer. The paper demonstrates the potential of combining cell-based simulations with genetic network models to analyze early embryogenesis and provide predictions that can be tested experimentally.
The paper describes a study that analyzed the genomic and spatial-temporal dynamics of influenza A virus during a single season (2006-207) in the United States. The study found that during this season, multiple clades of both A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 viruses co-circulated within both space and time, with at least five different antigenically distinct types of virus detected. While A/H1N1 viruses dominated early in the season, an A/H3N2 clade later became the dominant subtype. The study found evidence of extensive genetic and antigenic diversity across the US, with multiple clades circulating in both urban and remote areas. However, it was difficult to determine clear spatial patterns of spread due to limited sampling, especially in remote areas. The study suggests that influenza virus introductions into the US are multiple times during an epidemic, with A/H3N2 virus likely circulating at higher levels outside the US. The paper also found evidence of reassortment between clades of both A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 viruses, suggesting that inter-subtype reassortment may not be common due to the genetic distance between the subtypes.
The paper describes the discovery of a novel ciliary protein called DYF-1/MIP-T3, which is required for the formation and function of cilia in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. The authors identified DYF-1/MIP-T3 as a conserved protein that localizes to ciliated cells and is associated with the intraflagellar transport (IFT) machinery that moves proteins along cilia. They found that mutants lacking DYF-1/MIP-T3 have ciliary defects, including shortened cilia and impaired chemotaxis, avoidance of high osmolarity, and dauer formation, and increased lipid accumulation. The DYF-1/MIP-T3 protein is found to localize to ciliary transition zones and axonemes, and is required for the assembly of IFT particles. The authors suggest that DYF-1/MIP-T3 may play a general role in cilia formation and function, possibly as an intraflagellar transport protein that helps link microtubules to the IFT machinery. They also found that vertebrate MIP-T3 orthologs, like DYF-1/MIP-T3, are required for basal body/cilia function and gastrulation movements in zebrafish embryos, supporting the idea that MIP-T3 plays an important role in development.
The paper describes the generation and characterization of two mouse models that recapitulate the epigenetic regulation of the D4Z4 repeat encoding the DUX4 gene, which is associated with the human genetic disorder Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD). The two mouse models, D4Z4-2.5 and D4Z4-1.5, were generated by integrating human D4Z4 genomic regions into mouse chromosomes 17 and 4, respectively. The D4Z4-2.5 mice showed low levels of DUX4 expression in skeletal muscle and variable expression in other tissues, while the D4Z4-1.5 mice had more efficient somatic repression of DUX4. The D4Z4-2.5 mice showed a variegated pattern of DUX4 expression in skeletal muscle cells, with only a subset of cells expressing high levels, while the D4Z4-1.5 mice showed more consistent DUX4 expression. The D4Z4-2.5 mice also reproduced some of the molecular features of FSHD patients, including low CpG methylation and a higher ChCS. The DUX4 protein was shown to act as a transcriptional activator in mouse cells, regulating germline and early stem cell programs, as well as retrotransposons. The study demonstrates that the epigenetic regulation of the D4Z4 repeat is conserved between human and mouse, and may provide a suitable model for studying the in vivo regulation of DUX4 and its consequences for FSHD.
The paper describes the Rosetta Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program, a summer research program in biomolecular structure prediction and design that exposes undergraduate students to a distributed research environment to facilitate progress in computational biology. The program was designed to expose students to a virtual community and introduce new training paradigms, which are important for computational biology research. The REU program recruited a diverse cohort of students, including those from underrepresented backgrounds, and provided hands-on learning in computational methods development and research projects at Rosetta labs. Students remained connected through various channels, including a boot camp, weekly research projects, and a conference. The program aimed to foster an inclusive culture and diversity and found that the diversity of the cohort contributed to a strong sense of community among the students. The authors discuss challenges in teaching students with varied backgrounds and plan to revise the boot camp to focus more on general computational biology skills. They also intend to improve mentoring practices to help students connect with their mentors during the research period. Overall, the REU program shows that undergraduates can perform research in a distributed setting and exposes students to a virtual community, which can help broaden participation in computational biology research.
This paper investigates how the hBD3 protein affects the immune response to polyI:C. The researchers find that hBD3 enhances the production of cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, etc.) in response to polyI:C stimulation in both mouse and human macrophages. They show that this effect is dependent on the correct disulfide-bonded structure of hBD3, which increases the cytoplasmic localization of polyI:C. They find that hBD3 exacerbates signalling through the MDA5 receptor, which is involved in the production of type I interferons, but inhibits signalling through the TICAM1 receptor. The increased production of type I interferons is additive when lipofectamine is also present, suggesting that hBD3 increases the cytoplasmic localization of polyI:C. The results suggest that hBD3 may have a beneficial effect on the immune response to viral infection by enhancing the production of interferons, but the long-term effects of increased copy number of the β-defensin cluster on psoriasis are not yet clear.
The paper investigates the role of glucose metabolism in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) pathogenesis. The authors find that M. tuberculosis has two functional glucokinases, PPGK and GLKA, which can phosphorylate glucose to produce glucose-6-phosphate, but PPGK is the primary enzyme that allows M. tuberculosis to utilize glucose as a carbon source. M. tuberculosis expresses two transporters for glucose uptake but does not seem to utilize glucose metabolism in vivo. However, when both glucokinases are deleted, M. tuberculosis loses viability and fails to persist in mice during chronic infection. The authors conclude that glucose phosphorylation is important for M. tuberculosis fitness during chronic infection, likely providing energy and biomass. The authors also find that M. tuberculosis is metabolically flexible and can utilize multiple carbon sources, but glucose phosphorylation is crucial for M. tuberculosis pathogenesis.
This paper investigates the migration patterns of avian influenza viruses in North American wild birds. The authors use a systematic surveillance program to collect viral samples from 20 discrete regions in Canada and the US over 25 years, focusing on the H3 subtype which was most frequently isolated. They sequenced 20 full genomes and 10 additional viruses for genomic analysis. The analysis shows that while there are some indications of geographic structuring of the virus population, the viruses tend to mix extensively and rapidly between different geographic locations, even at distances of up to 10000 km. The migration rates between locations are estimated to be similar within and between flyways, indicating that viruses can move between populations through both migratory Anseriformes and Charadriiformes. The study suggests that while Charadriiformes may not be a major host of the virus in North America, they may play a role in introducing and maintaining the virus in certain areas, particularly where migratory bird populations overlap. The results highlight the importance of continued surveillance in major bird congregation zones to better understand the long-term persistence of the avian influenza gene pool and develop preparedness plans for emerging viral threats.
The paper describes HLA*IMP:02, a new method for imputing classical HLA alleles from genotype data from multiple populations. The method is aimed at multi-population and multi-ethnic settings where HLA type imputation has been challenging due to haplotype heterogeneity and genotyping error. The authors show that HLA*IMP:02 achieves higher accuracy than HLA*IMP:01 when applied to heterogeneous reference panels, particularly for European samples. They demonstrate that HLA*IMP:02 is able to accommodate haplotypic heterogeneity and impute HLA alleles on multiple haplotype backgrounds. The method is robust to missing data in the inference panel and achieves high accuracy at 4-digit resolution for non-European samples, though at 2-digit resolution, HLA alleles are imputed more reliably. The authors show that extending the reference panel with additional samples from non-European populations can further increase accuracy for non-European samples, but more diverse reference data is needed to achieve 4-digit accuracy. The method provides a framework for integrating HLA type imputation from multi-population and multi-ethnic reference panels without compromising accuracy in European populations.
The paper discusses the role of cholinergic signaling in the mucosal immune system during enteric bacterial infection. The authors show that cholinergic signaling through the β2 adrenergic receptor on choline acetyltransferase-expressing T cells (ChAT cells is required for the recruitment of these cells to the colon during rodentium infection. These ChAT+ T cells produce acetylcholine, which enhances interferon gamma-induced nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2) expression in intestinal epithelial cells, limiting bacterial burden. Conditional ablation of ChAT in T cells leads to reduced NOS2 expression in the colon, resulting in increased bacterial burden and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. This suggests that ChAT+ T cells play a protective role in the mucosal immune system during enteric bacterial infection. The authors propose that cholinergic signaling through β2AR on ChAT+ T cells is an important node mediating host protection during enteric bacterial infection. Further studies are needed to fully understand how these specialized T cells are activated and how they contribute to the host defense against enteric pathogens.
The paper proposes a frequency response technique to identify signal transduction pathways in proteins using targeted molecular dynamics simulations. The method involves applying periodic perturbations to local regions of the protein, such as the WPD loop, and analyzing the atomic displacements and dihedral angles of the perturbed atoms. The technique identifies clusters of atoms that fluctuate in-phase with each other, which suggests that they are communicating through a collective motion. The clusters are then mapped onto the protein structure to identify residue couplings and signal transduction pathways. The technique was applied to the protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B, where it identified several clusters of perturbed atoms that corresponded to specific functional regions of the protein. The study shows that the perturbations propagated through the protein via hydrophobic interactions and backbone connectivity, and that the WPD loop and R-loop were coupled through the P-loop. The technique provides a way to identify signaling pathways in proteins that are not captured by traditional methods like PCA and linear response theory. The study highlights the importance of considering frequency response in protein dynamics to better understand allostery and how signals are transmitted between different regions of the protein.
The paper proposes a new method called Sequence-Based Feature Projection Ensemble Learning for predicting lncRNA-protein interactions, called SFPEL-LPI. The method extracts features from lncRNA and protein sequences and known lncRNA-protein interactions to calculate lncRNA-lncRNA and protein-protein similarities. It then combines the similarities with a feature projection learning frame to make predictions. The method can predict lncRNA-protein interactions for both known and new lncRNAs/proteins, and outperforms existing methods on a benchmark dataset. It also shows that it can identify novel lncRNA-protein interactions that have not been observed in previous studies. However, the method has limitations in that it requires parameter tuning and only uses known lncRNA-protein interactions, which are limited. Further research could improve the method by incorporating more interactions and expanding the dataset.
The paper presents a detailed study on the spatial distribution of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes at the household level in two urban neighborhoods in Iquitos, Peru. The study found that while mosquito populations showed clustering at the household level, the hotspots were unstable and temporary, shifting between surveys. This suggests that focusing vector control efforts on identified hotspots is unlikely to be practical in most dengue endemic areas. The paper argues that vector control should instead focus on larger geographic areas with historically high transmission levels within cities, rather than targeting individual households. The paper highlights that the spatial and temporal scales at which entomological measures are valid and the limited consideration of environmental, biological and human behavioral drivers of human-mosquito contacts are important knowledge gaps in developing effective vector control programs. The study also found that the probability of adult Ae. aegypti dispersing beyond the household decreases exponentially with distance, indicating that control measures applied at 100m from a case's residence would overestimate the actual risk associated with a potential transmission hotspot. The results suggest that targeting vector control at hotspots identified through entomological surveys may not be an efficient use of resources, given the focal distribution of Ae. aegypti adults.
This paper proposes a method to analyze the connectome of the nematode worm Caenhabitis elegans using a dynamics-based approach. The authors use diffusive processes on graphs to model signal propagation in the network, and then use community detection and role-based similarity analysis to identify flow-based groupings of neurons. They find that the connectome exhibits a hierarchical structure at different scales, with certain neurons playing key roles in signal propagation. They then use ablation experiments to identify neurons that are most disruptive of the signal flow organization, which could be useful for future experimental investigations. The approach provides an integrated network-theoretic analysis that links structure and function in the connectome, and could be used in conjunction with experimental techniques. The study demonstrates the power of using dynamics-based methods to study complex networks, especially non-spiking systems like the C. elegans connectome. The authors suggest future work to incorporate more realistic dynamics models and consider the effects of inhibitory synapses and nonlinearities, as well as study the connectome as a multiplex network.
The paper proposes and evaluates a deep learning model called MRNet that can automatically classify knee MRI exams as normal or abnormal. The model was trained on 130 knee MRI exams and achieved an AUC of 0.93, 0.95 0.93 for detecting abnormalities, 0.96 0.95 0.96 for detecting ACL tears, and 0.84 0.84 0.87 for detecting meniscal tears. Providing model predictions to clinical experts resulted in a statistically significant increase in specificity for detecting ACL tears. The model also showed potential to rule out ACL tears, with a specificity of 0.96 compared to clinicians' specificity of 0.93. The model also showed potential to improve inter-rater reliability among clinical experts. The study demonstrates that deep learning models can be applied to knee MRI to generate rapid automated pathology classifications and provide feedback to clinicians, potentially improving interpretation efficiency and reducing errors. However, the model required additional training on external data to achieve optimal performance. Future work is needed to improve the performance and generalizability of deep learning models for knee MRI and determine the optimal integration of these models in clinical practice.
The paper describes a crystallographic study of the Lewis antigen binding interface of norovirus VA207, a member of the GII genogroup. The authors expressed the P domain of VA207 in E. coli and found that it binds to Lewis antigens through the α-1,3 fucose epitope, unlike the known VA38 GII.4 strain which binds through the α-1,2 fucose epitope. They introduced mutations to residues involved in the binding interface and found that mutations at the core binding pocket resulted in complete loss of binding to all Lewis antigens. However, some residues outside the core pocket also play a role in determining binding specificity. The study showed that the recognition of Lewis antigens is a prerequisite for norovirus infection and highlighted the importance of human HBGAs in shaping the evolution of noroviruses. The authors suggest that the sialic acid in VA207 may stabilize the structure of the SLex antigen, but does not directly participate in binding. The study provides structural evidence on the flexibility of carbohydrate binding modes and the importance of the Lewis antigen interface for norovirus evolution.
The paper describes a method for mapping recombination frequencies in RNA viruses using a synthetic poliovirus genome engineered with 36 synonymous mutations spaced every 18nt. The synthetic genome was generated and tested for viability and was found to have a mild loss of fitness compared to the wild type. Co-infection of the synthetic and wild type viruses with HeLaS3 cells was used to generate viral RNA for deep sequencing. The high resolution mapping of recombination frequencies showed that GC content and AU/GC tracts were associated with increased recombination. The authors modified a portion of the poliovirus genome to increase the GC content and found that this increased recombination frequency by 7.4x. The results suggest that thermodynamic factors, such as RNA secondary structure, influence recombination in poliovirus. The paper concludes that a global redesign of the poliovirus genome to disrupt secondary structure elements and modulate nucleotide use could reduce recombination potential. The paper provides a new approach to mapping recombination frequencies in RNA viruses, which could be useful for developing attenuated vaccine strains.
The paper discusses evidence for the idea that natural selection promotes the ability of microbial pathogens to evolve new antigens in order to evade the immune system. The authors study the Lyme disease bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi as an example. They find that within each strain of the bacterium, genetic diversity among the unexpressed genes that encode the surface protein VlsE is correlated with the ability of VlsE to evolve new antigens. They argue that this correlation is likely due to natural selection promoting diversity among the genes that encode the unexpressed genes, which then leads to the ability to generate new antigens. They provide evidence that natural selection favors genetic diversity among these genes through various mechanisms, including the presence of tandem repeat sequences, the high rate of indel mutations in the genes, and the correlation between diversity among genes and antigenic evolvability. They propose a model that natural selection favors genetic diversity in the unexpressed genes in order to promote antigenic evolvability.
The paper discusses how the TREM-2 receptor, expressed by macrophages in the lungs, plays a previously unknown role in modulating bacterial phagocytosis and inflammation during Streptococococcus pneumoniae infection. The authors found that TREM-2-deficient macrophages exhibit enhanced phagocytosis of S. pneumoniae compared to wild-type macrophages, which leads to improved bacterial clearance and survival during pneumocococcal pneumonia. However, TREM-2 deficiency in macrophages also leads to increased C1q production, which in turn enhances bacterial phagocytosis. The authors propose that TREM-2 regulates C1q production in macrophages via a mechanism that involves PPAR-δ activity. The study suggests that targeting TREM-2 could be a novel strategy for modulating C1q production and pulmonary innate immune responses, which may be relevant for respiratory infections and autoimmune diseases.
The paper discusses the kinetics of the generation of Th17 cells during Schistosoma japonicum infection in mice. It finds that during the early stages of infection, the proportion of Th17 cells increases slowly but then increases rapidly after eggs are deposited in the liver. This suggests that it is the egg antigens that induce more Th17 cells. The paper also shows that the inducing and suppressive factors of Th17 cell differentiation, including cytokines, increase during the course of infection. In contrast, immunization with Schistosoma egg antigens preferentially induces Th17 cell differentiation and higher levels of the cytokines involved in Th17 cell differentiation, while suppressing the inhibitory factors. The study finds that administration of IL-17A does not contribute to protective responses during the early stages of infection, but decreasing IL-17 levels may contribute to more effective protection. These findings suggest that the generation of Th17 cells is determined by the integrated impact of the inducing and suppressive factors promoted by parasitic antigens and that a decrease in IL-17 levels may contribute to host protection.
The paper describes the identification and characterization of a gene called SREB in the dimorphic fungus Blastomyces dermatitidis that regulates the transition from yeast to mold form. The authors used insertional mutagenesis to identify a gene that causes a yellow-orange pigmentation in the fungus, indicating the gene is involved in the phase transition from yeast to mold. The SREB gene encodes a GATA transcription factor that regulates the biosynthesis of siderophores and affects morphology. The authors identified genes that are directly or indirectly regulated by SREB and found that SREB affects lipid metabolism and cell wall remodeling. The study shows that SREB functions independently of iron assimilation and is required for growth in the mold form, which is thought to be essential for the survival of dimorphic fungi in nature. The SREB null mutant has a yellow-orange pigmentation and fails to convert from yeast to mold. The study provides insight into the regulatory mechanisms that control the phase transition in dimorphic fungi and may help elucidate the regulatory circuit that governs growth in the mold form.
This paper investigates the regulation of DNA repair protein Sae2 by sumoylation and phosphorylation. The authors find that Sae2, a DNA end resection factor, is sumoylated in addition to being phosphorylated, which enhances its solubility and function. The sumoylation of Sae2 promotes the removal of DNA ends, while phosphorylation of Sae2 promotes its solubility. The sumoylation of Sae2 also collaborates with phosphorylation to enhance its resection function, as reducing sumoylation of Sae2 impairs resection. Reduced resection leads to increased non-homologous end joining, which in turn increases DNA repair capacity. The authors propose that sumoylation of additional DNA repair factors, in addition to phosphorylation, may also collaborate to regulate DNA repair pathway levels and choice in response to cell cycle and lesion loads. The ensemble effect of sumoylation of multiple substrates may provide robustness to the system. The results provide evidence for a new role for sumoylation in regulating DNA repair and collaboration between sumoylation and phosphorylation.
The paper discusses how persistent bacterial infections in the urinary tract may contribute to the development of chronic urinary tract infections (UTI). The authors used a mouse model to study this phenomenon, finding that a subset of mice with a history of persistent bacterial infections were more likely to develop chronic cystitis, or long-term bladder infections. They found that this was associated with severe inflammation during the early stages of infection, particularly at 24 hours post-infection. They propose that the development of chronic cystitis primes the host immune response, making the host more susceptible to subsequent bacterial colonization and chronic infections. They identified several factors that predicted the development of chronic cystitis, including elevated levels of IL-5, IL-6, G-CSF, and KC in the serum at 24 hours post-infection, and severe bladder inflammation at 24 hours. The study suggests that chronic UTI may be caused by a mucosal immune checkpoint that occurs early in in in infection, which can facilitate chronic bacterial colonization. The authors propose that females with enhanced mucosal TLR4 signaling may be more susceptible to chronic infections, as they found that C3H mice were more likely to develop chronic cystitis. The study provides a new basis for understanding UTI and chronic infections and suggests that a quiescent intracellular reservoir may exist in humans, potentially modulating the mucosal response to bacteria.
This paper aims to study the emergence of phase synchrony across multiple neural networks with different intrinsic properties and synaptic coupling strengths. The authors propose a framework based on weakly coupled oscillators to model the dynamics of the networks. They show that the phase synchrony between the networks can be controlled by adjusting the coupling strength and the synaptic delay. For the phase-locked states, the phase lag between the networks can be either symmetric or asymmetric depending on the coupling strength and synaptic delay. They demonstrate that the asymmetric phase lag leads to a directed transfer of information between the networks. They also show that the phase lag can be measured using the phase resetting curve, which is a signature of the information transfer between the networks. The results provide insights into the functional connectivity between the networks and the causal direction of signaling between them, which is a key question in understanding brain communication. The framework and results shed new light on the dynamical emergence of gamma oscillations and their role in cognitive functions.
This paper describes a genome-wide survey of polymorphism in the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum in a single endemic population in The Gambia. The study identified 285 genes with polymorphic site frequency spectra consistent with balancing selection, which is evidence of recent positive selection. Many of these genes encode proteins that are potential targets of immunity, including the apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) that has been previously shown to be under balancing selection in multiple studies. The gene with the highest Tajima's D value was the msp3-like PF1035 gene, which encodes a protein that is expressed in only a minority of mature schizonts but varies significantly among different parasite clones and shows a heterochromatic marking associated with sub-telomeric genes. The study suggests that identifying this protein as a target of naturally-acquired immunity may be more challenging than other merozoite antigens. The results indicate that balancing selection is particularly active on the extracellular invasive stage of the parasite in the blood and that genes encoding proteins broadly categorized by location of expression were investigated, showing a broad range of values of Tajima's D. The study provides new insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying the evolution of P. falciparum and may help identify potential targets for vaccine development.
This paper uses phylogenomic analysis of hundreds of free-living proteomes to study the evolutionary dynamics of protein domain gains and losses across the three superkingdoms of Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya. The authors use structural classification of protein domains (SCOP) to group domains into families, folds, superfamilies, and families. They find that gains outnumber losses in all superkingdoms and that the gain-to-loss ratio increases with evolutionary time. They also find that Archaea had the highest number of superkingdom-specific domains and the earliest gain of universal domains. This suggests that Archaea was the first superkingdom to follow reductive evolutionary trends. The authors also find that Bacteria had the highest number of bacteria-specific domains and that their gain-to-loss ratio increased more than the other superkingdoms, indicating that Bacteria were more prolific at discovering new domains. They propose that the gain of novel domains is a continuous process that compensates for the economical proteomes of eukaryotes. The results provide insights into the evolutionary history of the three superkingdoms and the mechanisms driving their diversification.
The paper discusses the potential benefits of improving hygiene and basic skin care for people suffering from lymphedema filariasis, a neglected tropical disease that affects 14 million people worldwide. The authors conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies on the effect of hygiene-based lymphedema management interventions on acute dermatolymphangitis (ADLA) episodes, limb circumference/volume, quality of life, and disability. They found that participation in lymphedema management programs was associated with a significant reduction in ADLA episodes, improved quality of life, and increased capacity to work. While mass drug distribution has been prioritized for interrupting transmission of the parasitic worms causing the disease, providing hygiene-based lymedema care to affected persons increases acceptance of antifilarial drugs and leads to higher drug coverage. The authors argue that lymphedema management is an important aspect of neglected tropical disease elimination and that has the potential to significantly improve health outcomes, quality of life, and economic productivity. They suggest that refinement of integrated hygiene-based intervention packages and delivery mechanisms is needed, as the current studies show that the basic hygiene components are effective. Improved water and sanitation management can also help reduce transmission of the disease.
The paper presents a study on the relationship between exposure to malaria and the acquisition of immunity in children in an area where both Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax are co-endemic. The study found that children aged 0.9 to 4.5 years had a higher molecular force of blood-stage infections (molFOB) compared to older children, which was associated with a higher incidence of clinical episodes of P. vivax malaria. The molFOB was found to peak in younger children and then decrease with age, while the number of blood-stage infections acquired by P. falciparum increased with age. The difference in molFOB between the two species was found to be due to the rapid relapse of P. vivax infections, as opposed to the direct link between transmission intensity and molFOI for P. falciparum. The study suggests that high exposure to P. vivax infections in early childhood contributes to the rapid acquisition of immunity against clinical P. vivax malaria, as measured by the molFOB. The molFOB was found to be significantly associated with incidence of P. vivax malaria, and the lack of association with age suggests that some P. vivax sporozoites transmitted by mosquitoes do not establish detectable blood stage infections in older children. The results suggest that molFOB could be used as a surrogate marker for exposure and an indicator of the impact of antimalarial interventions.
The paper investigates the relationship between vitamin D deficiency (VDD) and the risk of developing tuberculosis (TB) disease. While observational studies have shown lower vitamin D levels among TB patients compared to healthy controls, it is unclear whether low vitamin D levels contribute to TB disease progression or if TB infection itself leads to decreased serum 25(OH)D levels. The authors conducted a nested case-control analysis in a prospective cohort of household contacts of TB patients in Peru and pooled these data with other studies to conduct an individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis. They found that low serum 25(OH)D levels were associated with an increased risk of incident TB disease, with the strongest association among HIV-positive individuals with severe vitamin D deficiency (VDD). However, the association was only significant among HIV-positive individuals and not among HIV-negative individuals. The authors suggest that low vitamin D levels may contribute to TB risk among HIV-infected individuals by exacerbating immune dysregulation and reflecting severity of immunosuppression. The study highlights the potential benefits of vitamin D supplementation among high-risk individuals to prevent TB disease, but randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm this association.
The paper investigates the trade-offs between different sensing characteristics of allosteric sensors, such as dynamic range, Hill number, intrinsic noise, capacity, static gain, response time, and static gain. The Monod-Wyman-Changeux model is used to simulate allosteric sensors with different numbers of subunits and biases to determine how these characteristics change as a function of the number of subunits. The results show that there are strong constraints between characteristics, such that specifying one characteristic strongly constrains others. For example, increasing the dynamic range typically reduces the intrinsic noise, while increasing the Hill number typically reduces the static gain. The response time also tightens as the number of subunits increases. The paper finds that most of the space of characteristics is inaccessible for typical parameter values, indicating that sensors must trade off between different characteristics to maximize information transfer. However, the capacity, which determines the number of discriminable input concentrations, has a maximum value around 2 bits for a population of 100 sensors. The paper concludes that natural selection may have selected sensing characteristics that balance the trade-offs between different characteristics.
This paper investigates the heterogeneity of the temporal progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by studying the distribution of GDS/FAST stage durations in a large longitudinal dataset of AD patients. They find that there is a significant degree of variation in the lengths of GDS/FAST stages 4-6, with standard deviations of stage durations being as large as the mean durations. This indicates that the cognitive and functional decline of individual patients varies significantly from patient to patient. While mean values of GDS/FAST stages are similar to those reported in the literature, the actual durations vary significantly between patients. The authors demonstrate a method to estimate the probability distribution of stage durations from longitudinal data, using a combination of patient records to approximate the stage intervals. They show that the variance in stage durations is large and that the mean values do not differ significantly between GDS and FAST systems. The findings suggest that AD is a genuinely heterogeneous disease, with patterns of cognitive and functional decline that vary from patient to patient.
The paper describes a study that used brain imaging techniques to investigate how long-term memories are organized in the brain. The researchers trained mice to associate a context with an a mild footshock and then tested their memory at short and long retention delays after training. They found that functional networks engaged by recalling the contextual fear memory had a small-world topology, with a few highly connected hubs that likely play key roles in network function. The networks differed at the short and long retention delays, with stronger inter-cortical connections and a more pronounced thalamic-hippocortical signature at the longer delay. The central core of highly connected hubs included brain regions that have been previously implicated in remote memory expression, such as the anterior cingulate cortex and prelimbic cortex. The analysis suggests that functional connections within the neocortex, within the hippocampus and between the hippocampus and neocortex, and between the hippocampus and thalamic regions are important for memory stability. The degeneracy of the hippocampal activity at the long retention delay suggests that the hippocampus plays a sustained role in the expression of contextual fear memories. The results suggest that recall of long-term memories involves coordinated activation of a broad network of brain regions, with highly connected hubs likely playing disproportionate roles in network function. The findings provide a global picture of how a long-term fear memory is organized in the brain and suggest that degeneracy in key brain regions may not necessarily prevent the formation of a contextual fear memory, although this degeneracy may impact the robustness of the memory.
The paper discusses the role of a chromatin remodeler protein called Mi-2 in the rapid activation of heat shock genes in Drosophila. The authors find that Mi-2 is recruited to activated heat shock genes through its interaction with a modified form of RNA polymerase II called PARP. They show that Mi-2 binds directly to PARP, which accumulates rapidly at activated heat shock genes. This binding is required for Mi-2 to efficiently recruit to and activate the genes, suggesting a novel mechanism for chromatin remodeling factors to be recruited to stress-activated chromatin. The authors propose that PARylation of chromatin serves as a signaling scaffold to rapidly recruit chromatin remodeling factors to stress-activated regions, a mechanism that may be important for efficient repair and transcriptional activation of heat shock genes. This is the first evidence for an in vivo function of PARylation in recruiting a chromatin remodeler to activated chromatin.
This paper discusses how latent-class modeling can be used to estimate the true prevalence of echinococcosis in dogs and the diagnostic test performance of multiple tests. The authors used three tests to diagnose echinocococis infection in dogs: arecoline purgation, copro-antigen tests and PCR. They found that the sensitivity of arecoline purgation was higher than previously reported, but that the specificity of PCR tests was lower. The results suggest that the prevalence of echinococosis varied between populations and that dog sex and age were not significant covariates. The findings highlight the importance of using multiple tests and accounting for the latent infection status in the analysis to avoid reaching inappropriate conclusions about the significance of covariates. The authors conclude that using multiple tests can provide more accurate estimates of test performance and prevalence in populations where a gold standard is not available.
This paper describes a new approach to analyzing DNA synthesis in individual cells using DNA foci labeled with thymidine analogues. The authors show that DNA foci within individual chromosomal domains in early S phase maintain a genetic association along the chromosome that defines the timing of DNA synthesis. The spatial organization of these foci within individual cells is consistent with a "next-in-line" mechanism of DNA synthesis, where foci that are labeled during consecutive S phase intervals are genetically adjacent. This genetic continuity along chromosomes defines the replication timing program. The authors conclude that the organization of DNA foci within individual chromosomal domains, rather than the activation of individual replication origins, is the key determinant of DNA synthesis timing in mammalian cells. This organization allows cells to complete DNA synthesis with high efficiency while preserving genetic and epigenetic information. The study demonstrates that the genetic continuity of DNA foci along chromosomes provides a fundamental mechanism to ensure that cells can complete DNA synthesis with the required precision while tolerating genetic variability in the timing of replication origins.
This paper discusses the results of experiments using conditional mutant mice to investigate which neuronal populations mediate the effects of the psychoactive compound THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) from the plant Cannabis sativa. The researchers generated mice that specifically lacked expression of the CB1 cannabinoid receptor in different neuronal populations, such as GABAergic interneurons, cortical glutamatergic neurons, and dopamine receptor D1-expressing neurons. They found that while THC effects were abolished in mice lacking CB expression in GABAergic interneurons, it was only partially reduced in mice lacking CB expression in cortical glutamatergic neurons. The researchers conclude that hypolocomotion and hypothermia depend on cortical glutamatergic neurons, while analgesia and catalepsy depend on principal neurons. The paper suggests that different subpopulations of striatal neurons may mediate different effects of THC. The results provide evidence that cannabinoid receptors expressed in different neuronal populations play different roles in mediating different effects of the drug, and suggest that conditional mutants can be useful for identifying which neurons are involved in different effects.
This paper discusses the potential for "therapeutic interfering particles" (TIPs) to control the rapid evolution of HIV. The authors build a multi-scale model of HIV dynamics at the individual, patient, and population levels to determine the conditions under which TIPs can stably control HIV within a population. They find that TIPs can be engineered to express 3-4 times more genomic RNA transcripts than HIV to be stable within individuals, and this stability translates to population-level stability. However, they also show that HIV mutants that increase their viral load or prevalence within individuals are able to invade populations and spread, undermining TIP efficacy. The key factors are the tradeoff between host-level and population-level selection pressures. At the host scale, HIV mutants with higher viral loads are favored, but at the population scale, HIV mutants that reduce TIP prevalence are favored. The model shows that TIPs can be engineered to be stable within patients, but mutants that increase viral load or prevalence within individuals can spread and undermine TIP efficacy. The findings suggest that TIPs may be able to control HIV evolution and spread within populations, but design constraints are needed to prevent the emergence of TIP-resistant HIV mutants.
This paper discusses the evolutionary history of the transferrin receptor (TfR) gene in the order Carnivora, a group of mammals that includes dogs, wolves, coyotes, foxes, jackals, and others. The TfR gene has been under positive selection in the Caniformia suborder, particularly in species closely related to modern dogs. The authors show that this selection likely occurred in response to ancient parvovirus infections, which imposed strong selective pressure on the TfR gene. The TfR gene evolved non-synonymous mutations that allowed it to resist infection by parvoviruses, with one specific mutation in the apical domain of the gene being particularly important. The authors introduced this mutation into a jackal TfR and showed that it reduced parvovirus binding and infection. They suggest that this mutation may have been the key factor that allowed dogs and their ancestors to resist infection by parviruses for millions of years before the emergence of canine parvovirus in the 1970s. The study shows that the TfR gene has evolved adaptively to the longstanding interaction between hosts and parviruses, providing insight into the evolution of viruses and their hosts.
This paper describes an experiment to generate a live attenuated vaccine for the tick-borne flavivirus Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) using large-scale codon re-encoding. The researchers randomly reencoded the NS5 gene of a highly neurovirulent strain of TBEV with 27 synonymous mutations to reduce its pathogenicity. The resulting re-encoded virus was tested in cellulo and in vivo experiments to evaluate its fitness and attenuation. The results showed that while the re-encoded virus had reduced replicative fitness in cellulo, it exhibited an attenuated phenotype in mice, with reduced neuroinvasiveness and neurovirulence. Immunization with the re-encoded virus induced neutralizing antibodies and provided protection against subsequent challenge with wild-type TBEV. The study demonstrates that large-scale codon re-encoding can be used to generate live attenuated vaccine candidates that are safe, induce high levels of protective immunity and are relatively easy to produce, and have specific advantages over existing vaccines. However, the authors suggest that it would be more practical to use a naturally lower neurovirulent strain of TBEV to generate a re-encoded vaccine with additional synonymous mutations to further reduce the encephalitic potential. The results provide evidence that large-scale codon re-encoding can be used to produce in vivo attenuated strains of TBEV that can be used as vaccines, representing a potential new approach for generating custom-designed live vaccines.
The paper evaluates the ability of two serological tests, LID-1 and LID-NDO, to diagnose different clinical forms of leprosy, particularly multibacillary leprosy, in Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil. The tests detect antibodies against recombinant fusion protein LID-1 and glycoprotein conjugate LID-NDO. The authors found that LID-1 and LID-NDO had high sensitivity and specificity to detect multibacillary leprosy and could estimate bacterial load. Antibody levels were highest in multibacillary patients and lowest in tuberculoid patients. Household contacts of multibacillary patients had higher antibody levels than household contacts of paucibacillary patients. The authors also found that household contacts of multibacillary patients were at higher risk of developing leprosy, especially when exposed to heavily infected multibacillary cases. Seroposity among household contacts was relatively high, indicating that they were likely exposed to M. leprae infection. The authors conclude that both LID-1 and LID-NDO ELISA represent important tools for early diagnosis of leprosy, especially in areas where histopathological examination is not available. They suggest that these tests could be used to monitor individuals at risk of developing leprosy and estimate bacterial load.
The paper discusses the mechanism of how prion proteins, which are infectious agents that cause neurodegenerative diseases, form in yeast. Yeast prions are composed of a prion domain (PrD) that can convert to amyloid. The paper shows that de novo formation of prions in yeast involves different stages. Initially, Sup35N-GFP molecules form dots and lines that colocalize with the main Rnq1 aggregate near the vacuole. These dots later extend into rings and lines. The study found that Rnq1 and Sup35 molecules interact in a close proximity during de novo formation of prions, but not in established prions. However, some Sup35 molecules do not overlap Rnq1 molecules. The paper proposes a model for the pathway of Sup35 conversion into mature prions. The study shows that Pin4C aggregates interact with Sup35 molecules during de novo formation, but not in established prions. Hsp104 is required for de novo prion formation. The study suggests that cross-seeding and another mechanism are involved in de novo prion formation. The paper provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying prion formation and how it may contribute to neurodegenerative diseases.
This paper investigates the role of the X chromosome in hybrid sterility between two mouse subspecies. The authors find that the X chromosome plays a disproportionate role in hybrid sterility between Mus musculus m. musculus and M. domesticus, particularly in male hybrids. They identify two loci, Hstx1 and Hstx2, that control hybrid sterility and meiotic arrest in male and female hybrids, respectively. They show that in male hybrids, the Hstx2 locus on the X chromosome causes meiotic arrest at the pachytene stage, resulting in sterility, while in female hybrids, the Hstx2 locus has a limited effect on the frequency of asynaptic pachytene oocytes. They propose a model where cis-acting signals on the X chromosome, rather than trans-acting signals, control meiotic pairing and synapsis, leading to sterility in male hybrids. They also find that the Hstx2 locus reduces the frequency of asynaptic pachytene oocytes in female hybrids. This work provides evidence for the idea that hybrid sterility genes are cis-acting rather than trans-acting, and that the X chromosome plays a key role in reproductive isolation between the two subspecies.
The paper presents a new coarse-grained normal mode analysis method called Elastic Network Contact Model (ENCoM) that incorporates information about the surface area in contact between atoms to predict the effect of mutations on protein stability and function. The method uses an elastic network model potential that includes terms to modulate interactions based on surface area in contact between atoms. The authors validate the method by predicting the effect of mutations on b-factors, a measure of atomic oscillations around equilibrium, and entropy differences in protein stability, using a dataset of 13 crystal structures. They find that ENCoM performs better than other methods in predicting stabilizing mutations, but not as well in predicting conformational changes. They also find that parameters that maximize overlap and mutation predictions have a trade-off between the two. The method is robust to the choice of parameters, and can be combined with other methods to further improve predictions. The authors argue that the ability to predict mutation effects on protein stability and function is important for understanding disease-causing mutations and protein engineering.
The paper proposes a model of the thalamocerebellar network that is thought to underlie essential tremor. The authors use a Wilson-Cowan model to represent the network and simulate the dynamics of the populations of neurons in the thalamus, cerebellum, cortex and cortex. They find that the network is able to oscillate at a frequency of 5.5 Hz, matching the frequency observed in patients undergoing deep brain stimulation. They show that DBS at low amplitudes changes the baseline oscillatory activity, while high frequency stimulation at the thalamus leads to a switch from low amplitude high frequency activity to high amplitude low frequency activity. They also show that the cortical input to the Vim nucleus must be stronger than the reticular input. The model suggests that the oscillations arise from an Andronov-Hopf bifurcation and are robust under parameter variations. The authors propose that the driving input to the Vim from the cerebellum must be stronger than the cortical feedback to maintain oscillations, which is consistent with the idea that essential tremor is caused by a lack of GABA in the cerebellum. The model predicts that high frequency stimulation may not necessarily abolish the pathological oscillations but allow the network to sustain them, while low frequency stimulation may allow the network to sustain the underlying activity. The study demonstrates the network level dynamics of the thalamocerebellar network can explain the effects of deep brain stimulation on essential tremor.
The paper compares clinical and microbiological characteristics of patients with invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) bacteremia to those with Salmonella Typhi bacteremia at a diarrheal hospital in Bangladesh. Despite the low incidence of NTS bacteremia, patients with NTS bacteremia had a higher fatality rate, were more likely to be malnourished, had concurrent pneumonia and clinical sepsis, and were more likely to present with concurrent signs of sepsis. In contrast, patients with Typhi bacteremia had lower hematocrit and were less likely to have concurrent infections. The authors found that NTS bacteremia patients were more likely to have a history of drinking unsafe water, and presented with shorter duration of fever. NTS bacteremia patients also had a different antibiotic susceptibility profile compared to Typhi bacteremia, with resistance to ceftriaxone and azithromycin. The study highlights the importance of considering NTS bacteremia in cases of lower respiratory tract infection where risk factors for NTS are present, and suggests that the higher severity of illness on presentation in NTS bacteremia may progress more quickly than in Typhi bacteremia. The findings suggest that NTS bacteremia is an important entity in Bangladesh, particularly among malnourished and immunocompromised patients, and warrant further investigation.
This paper studies the role of the poly(A) tail deadenylase PARN in mammalian cells. PARN depletion leads to the stabilization of some mRNAs, but only a small number of mRNAs are directly regulated by PARN. However, PARN depletion has wide-ranging effects on gene expression, including the regulation of cell motility and adhesion, as shown by increased wound healing and cell migration in PARN KD cells. The authors propose that PARN depletion may regulate translation efficiency, but not mRNA stability directly. The study finds that PARN depletion generally leads to decreased mRNA abundance, suggesting that mRNA decay and transcription are coupled. The study concludes that PARN depletion has a global impact on gene expression, although the mechanism remains unclear. The results suggest that PARN may regulate translation rather than transcription directly, although the authors cannot rule out the possibility that some mRNAs are stabilized through off-target effects of the shRNA. Further investigation is needed to clarify the mechanisms behind PARN's effects on gene expression and translation.
The paper describes a novel ultrastructural approach to study HIV-1 budding in primary human macrophages. The authors found that HIV-1 buds predominantly at the plasma membrane rather than intracellular endosomes in macrophages, contrary to previous studies that suggested endosomal budding. They used BSA-gold to label endosomes and RR to label the plasma membrane. They found that the majority of HIV-1 particles and budding sites were associated with RR-positive structures, indicating that they were derived from the plasma membrane. The labeling density of cellular proteins in the HIV-1 envelope was consistent between plasma membrane and RR-positive structures, supporting the plasma membrane origin. The authors conclude that HIV-1 budding occurs predominantly at the plasma membrane in macrophages, independent of the host cell type. This conclusion is supported by the immunomarker-independent EM approach, the lack of BSA-gold labeling of budding structures, and the similar labeling density of CD63 and CD4 on plasma membrane and virus-filled structures. The study suggests a universal HIV morphogenesis pathway that buds the virus predominantly at the plasma membrane, independent of the host cell type.
The paper describes a study on the consequences of compromising the mitochondrial biogenesis pathway in zebrafish. The authors used TALEN gene editing to generate mia40 mutants that lack functional mitochondrial protein biogenesis. They found that the mutants had enlarged mitochondria in muscle cells and glycolytic phenotypes, indicating compromised mitochondrial function. The mutants also had increased mtDNA content and decreased pancreatic function, consistent with a failure to compensate for the loss of Mia40 activity. The study shows that the Mia40 pathway is required for zebrafish development and survival, with the two paralogues of Mia40 exhibiting different functions. The study also found that proteins encoded by mitochondrial DNA were more strongly downregulated in the mutants, while transcripts were upregulated. The acinar cells of the pancreas were particularly affected, consistent with the mitochondrial dysfunction. The study provides a zebrafish model for studying the consequences of mitochondrial pathologies, which could aid in diagnosis and development of treatment strategies for human mitochondrial diseases.
The paper discusses the limitations of using entomological monitoring indicators of Aedes aegypti mosquito density as a proxy for the risk of dengue fever infection. The study found that while entomological monitoring of adult mosquito density measured over a short period of time, as part of routine surveillance, was not associated with the 6-month risk of dengue seroconversion. The authors suggest that this is likely due to cross-sectional measurement of the dynamic mosquito population, which may not capture the fine temporal variability in urban settings. Longitudinal monitoring of mosquito density, measured over a longer period of time, provided more informative associations with the 6-month risk of dengue seroconversion. However, even longitudinal monitoring still did not provide strong evidence of an association. The paper concludes that entomological monitoring indicators are not adequate proxies for true dengue exposure risk and are subject to operational limitations and biases. The findings suggest that dengue control programs should consider alternative monitoring frameworks that incorporate human dengue-related outcomes, such as passive case detection, serosurveys and active case detection, to better assess the impact of vector control interventions.
The paper proposes a computational framework based on Gaussian processes to perform spatial, temporal, and spatiotemporal predictions of infectious diseases. The framework is designed to capture the spatial and temporal dependencies of infectious diseases, which are important for public health policy making. The authors test their framework on Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever data in Turkey, using three different prediction scenarios: predicting case counts for unseen provinces, future time periods, and unseen provinces and time periods. They find that their Gaussian process regression algorithm outperforms random forest and boosted regression tree algorithms in capturing the range of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever case counts, particularly in the spatial and spatiotemporal scenarios. The results show that the framework can be used for predicting infected case numbers for unseen locations and time periods, which is important for public health policy. The framework could be extended to other vector-borne and infectious diseases and is publicly available. The paper demonstrates that Gaussian processes can be a useful tool for predicting infectious disease spread, which is important for public health policy making.
The paper discusses the results of a study on the seroprevalence of alpha- and flavivirus infections in western Kenya. The study found that 69% of participants were seropositive for previous alpha-virus exposure and 1.6% for flavivirus exposure. The prevalence was higher among adults than children, with the highest rates among those aged 15-24. Grazing in the last 12 months was identified as a significant risk factor for alpha-virus exposure, as was recent flooding. Proximity to water sources was also associated with exposure, particularly for alphavirus. The low number of flavivirus positives suggests that flaviviruses are not an emergent threat in the area, while alphaviruses are common and persistent. The study suggests that behavioral and environmental factors, such as grazing, flooding, and proximity to water, influence exposure to the two viruses differently. The findings indicate that vector populations are consistently present in western Kenya, and that there may be factors influencing differential exposure to the two viruses. Further research is needed to accurately determine the burden and impact of arboviruses in different localities.
The paper proposes a new approach to identify copy number variations (CNAs) associated with specific biological processes in human cancers by analyzing gene expression data. The approach uses a sparse factor model to decompose the expression patterns of gene signatures defined in vitro into sub-signatures or components that better represent the complexity of human cancer gene expression. By projecting these sub-signatures onto different cancer datasets, the authors were able to identify CNAs associated with the hypoxia and lactic acidosis gene signatures in human cancers. They found that the expression of these sub-signatures was significantly correlated with CNAs in specific chromosomal regions. This suggests that gene dosage changes caused by CNAs may lead to the coordinated expression of genes within specific chromosomal regions, rather than just cis-covariations. The approach identified several CNAs associated with hypoxia response in breast cancer that were not previously recognized, and also revealed that the expression of some genes was correlated with CNAs in different chromosomal locations. The results provide insights into the mechanisms underlying hypoxia pathway and aerobic glycolytic phenotypes in human cancers. The approach is generic and can be applied to other biological processes and pathways, allowing the identification of CNAs associated with specific pathway dysregulation. The identification of CNAs through this approach may help develop therapeutic strategies exploiting or inhibiting the hypoxia response.
This paper investigates the molecular mechanism of how Ewing's Sarcoma (EWS) activation domain (EAD) binds to its target proteins. The authors find that the key factor is cation-π interactions between the disordered EAD and basic residues on the target protein. They propose a model where the EAD has multiple aromatic residues that can form cation-π contacts with the target protein, leading to stable binding. They test this model experimentally by comparing the activity of EAD mutants with different numbers and types of aromatic residues and simulate the binding using a coarse-grained chain model. The results show good agreement between the experimental and simulated binding activities, supporting the cation-π hypothesis. They also find that altering the EAD charge, distribution of aromatic residues, and number of aromatic residues affects its activity. The model provides a biophysical basis for understanding how EAD interacts with multiple target proteins and may help identify potential therapeutic strategies for Ewing's family tumors.
The paper explores how the hippocampus helps people resist the attraction of immediate rewards and pursue long-term goals. The authors designed an experiment to test how the hippocampus is involved in intertemporal choices between options that are directly observable and those that require mental simulation. They found that people who imagined details when reading options showed a preference for simulated options, and this preference was associated with stronger hippocampus activity during the choice period. This activity was only observed during ecological choices where the simulated option had to be mentally simulated, not during control conditions where both options were observed. The authors argue that the hippocampus helps simulate future events and make the simulated option more attractive, which can reduce impulsivity. They also found that hippocampus grey matter density was associated with resistance to impulsivity in the ecological condition. They demonstrated that hippocampus damage, as seen in Alzheimer's disease, can lead to difficulties in pursuing long-term goals, specifically when simulated options are required. The study shows that the hippocampus plays a critical role in resisting immediate rewards and favoring simulated options, but does not directly influence how much delay is weighted.
The paper describes how a novel protein called ISLO-1 interacts with the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC) and regulates the localization of the calcium channel slo-1 in muscle cells. The DAPC complex is implicated in muscular dystrophy and other degenerative diseases, and the authors propose that the interaction between ISLO-1 and slo-1 helps regulate calcium influx and prevent excessive muscle contraction. The authors identify a novel mutation in the ISLO-1 gene that causes hypercontraction and headbending in muscle cells, which suggests that defects in ISLO-1 or the DAPC disrupt the localization of slo-1 channels. They find that ISLO-1 interacts with slo-1 in vivo and in transfected cells, and that this interaction is necessary for slo-1 localization in muscle cells. They propose that the interaction between ISLO-1 and slo-1 helps regulate calcium influx through L-type calcium channels, which in turn protects muscle cells from overexcitation and potential cellular damage. They also show that mutations in the DAPC genes that disrupt ISLO-1 localization do not convert the slo-1 gain-of-function phenotype, suggesting that ISLO-1 is distinct from other genes that regulate slo-1 function. Overall, the study provides a mechanism by which the DAPC regulates muscle excitability and calcium homeostasis through its interaction with slo-1 and other calcium channels.
The paper discusses the regulation of ethylene signaling in plants, specifically the role of the protein CBP20 in response to ethylene. Ethylene controls the growth of roots by regulating the expression of microRNAs (miRNAs). The authors show that phosphorylation of CBP20 at Ser25 is involved in the regulation of miR39b expression in response to ethylene, which in turn leads to the downregulation of the transcription factor MYB3. This leads to a reduction in root growth in the presence of ethylene. They identify specific miRNAs that are regulated in response to ethylene and show that miR39b specifically targets MYB3 for degradation, leading to the root growth inhibition in the presence of ethylene. They also demonstrate that miR39b is required for the ethylene response phenotype in the cbp20 mutant. Overall, their findings provide evidence that the phosphorylation of CBP20 is involved in the regulation of ethylene signaling and the growth of roots.
The paper proposes a new method called MiMBl (Minimization of Metabolites Balance) to improve the accuracy of optimization-based metabolic modeling. The current methods for metabolic modeling are sensitive to the stoichiometric representation of reactions, which can lead to inconsistent predictions when different stoichiometric matrices are used. The authors show that this sensitivity can be overcome by mapping the flux space into the metabolite space and formulating the objective function in terms of metabolite turnovers, rather than fluxes. They demonstrate that this approach, called MiMBl, is robust to the stoichiometry and independent of the stoichiometric representation. They show that MiMBl is able to predict more genetic interactions than other methods, especially positive interactions, by capturing regulatory effects that other methods miss. They also show that MiMBl can predict pleiotropic effects by simulating reactions that are inactive when one or both genes are deleted. The paper concludes that MiMBl provides a framework for consistent mathematical formulation of biological objective functions that enables unraveling the genotype-phenotype relations in metabolic networks.
This paper discusses the role of the Rad9 protein in the DNA damage checkpoint response. Rad9 is a mediator protein that plays a key role in the signal transduction cascade of the DNA damage response. Rad9 contains a tandem repeat of the BRCT motif, which is required for its function. The authors found that the BRCT domains of Rad9 also influence Rad9 binding to chromatin in unperturbed cells, both in G1 and M phase. However, in M phase, Rad9 binding to chromatin is not directly linked to Rad9 hyperphosphorylation. Instead, Dpb1-Rad9 interactions seem to be responsible for Rad9 chromatin binding in M phase. The authors showed that Dpb1-Rad9 interactions are specifically required for DNA damage checkpoint activation in M phase, and that CDK1 activity is required for this Dpb1-dependent branch of the checkpoint response. They also found that Rad9 chromatin binding is affected by cell cycle stage, with different mechanisms controlling Rad9-Dpb1 interactions in G1 and M phase. The study suggests that Rad9 plays two roles in the DNA damage response: mediating the signal transduction cascade and interacting with chromatin, with chromatin binding being a pre-requisite for Rad9's DNA damage response. The Dpb1-Rad9 interactions in M phase are a chromatin-independent mechanism that allows for rapid Rad9 hyperphosphorylation and recruitment of Rad53, while chromatin binding is a cell cycle-dependent mechanism that facilitates efficient DNA damage response.
This paper describes a study that used an enzyme methylome approach to simultaneously profile genetic and epigenetic polymorphisms in Arabidopsis thaliana accessions. The approach involved digesting genomic DNA with HpaII and MspI restriction enzymes and hybridizing the resulting fragments to an Affymetrix tiling array to identify constitutive and polymorphic CG methylation sites. The study found that constitutive methylation sites showed a preference for pericentromeric regions and decreased methylation towards chromosome arms, while methylation polymorphisms were more evenly distributed along the chromosomes. Methylation polymorphisms were enriched for functional categories such as binding and nucleic acid binding, consistent with previous studies. The study also found a negative correlation between methylation variation within immediate upstream/downstream regions and gene expression variation, suggesting that methylation within these regions may regulate gene expression. The results suggest that DNA methylation polymorphisms may contribute to natural gene expression variation through a coordinated effect over long distances, although the direct effect of methylation on expression is subtle. The findings demonstrate the power of simultaneously profiling genetic and epigenetic polymorphisms to understand the dynamics and biological functions of DNA methylation.
The paper describes a study on the use of adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASC) to prevent the progression of Chagas disease in mice infected with Trypanosoma cruzi. The study found that injection of ASC at 3 days post-infection, when the parasite burden is still high, reduces inflammation and fibrosis in the heart, as well as the number of parasites in the blood. The injection of ASC also reduces inflammatory responses in the spleen and lymph nodes, indicating that the anti-inflammatory effects are systemic. The reduction in parasite burden likely contributes to the reduction in heart remodeling and inflammation. The study suggests that ASC may be useful in preventing or treating Chagas disease by modulating the immune response and controlling parasite replication. However, the study notes that the use of ASC at 3 days post-infection is unlikely to be applicable in the clinical setting and that larger animal models are needed to fully determine the therapeutic potential. The results provide insight into the potential mechanisms by which ASC may act in Chagas disease and highlight the importance of investigating the timing and route of cell therapy for maximum efficacy.
This paper aimed to gain insight into the dynamics of H1N1pdm influenza virus transmission during the 2009 pandemic in the Southern hemisphere. The authors used mathematical modeling to assess the transmission characteristics of H1N1pd in 8 Southern hemisphere countries, including Argentina, Australia, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, New Zealand and South Africa. They analyzed weekly laboratory-confirmed H1N1pd or influenza-like illness (ILI) cases and cumulative age-specific incidence by age group. They found that countries with a higher proportion of children had higher estimated R0 values and attack rates. The models showed that demography, specifically population density and age structure, played a significant role in explaining differences in transmission between countries. However, the models were found to be simplifications of the true mixing patterns in the populations. The authors suggest that targeting vaccination at children may be more optimal for countries with a high proportion of school-age children. The results indicate that there may be country-to-country differences in epidemiology, but also suggest that some factors related to pre-existing immunity could play a role. The findings support the importance of developing age-structured models and collecting real-time data by age group for influenza epidemiology.
The paper investigates the role of cell-cell transmission in the emergence of antiviral resistance to direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The authors found that DAA-resistant HCV viruses disseminate mainly through cell-cell transmission, which is resistant to neutralizing antibodies, whereas cell-free transmission is less efficient. They show that blocking cell-cell transmission by host-targeting entry inhibitors (HTEIs) inhibits the spread of DAA-resistant viruses, preventing the emergence of resistance. They demonstrate that this effect is most pronounced when the HTEIs target cell adhesion molecules, such as CLDN1, which is essential for cell-cell transmission, whereas other entry factors like SR-BI are bypassed by other entry factors. The study suggests that blocking cell-cell transmission enhances antiviral activity of DAAs and prevents resistance in cell culture models, and may be a useful strategy for improving HCV treatment. The combination of DAAs with HTIs could potentially prevent viral breakthrough and treatment failure in difficult-to-treat patients, particularly for non-genotype 1 infections. The findings provide directions for the development of future HCV therapies targeting cell-cell transmission, which could overcome limitations of current DAAs, particularly for genotypes 2 and 3. The study also has implications for the treatment of other viruses that spread through cell-cell transmission, such as HIV, measles and HTLV-1.
The paper discusses how different HLA-B molecules have different abilities to be expressed on the surface of cells under conditions of TAP inhibition or deficiency. The authors found that some HLA-B molecules, called RIT molecules, are more resistant to TAP inhibition and can still be expressed at high levels even when TAP function is impaired. This is because these molecules have higher intrinsic stability and peptide-loading efficiency. They propose that HLA-B molecules have evolved to assemble via distinct pathways that allow them to counter pathogen evasion strategies that target the conventional TAP-dependent assembly pathway. RIT molecules are found to be more resistant to TAP inhibition because they have higher stability and peptide-loading efficiency. This allows them to still present peptides to CD8+ T cells under conditions where TAP function is impaired. In contrast, other HLA-B molecules with lower stability and peptide-loading efficiency are more sensitive to TAP inhibition and have lower surface expression. The study demonstrates that TAP inhibition induces expression of RIT HLA-B molecules that are partially peptide-receptive, and that these molecules can synergize with reduced levels of antigen-bound HLA-B molecules to maintain some level of CD8+ T cell surveillance under infections.
This paper explores how the activation-induced cytosine deaminase (AID) initiates immunoglobulin gene diversification in B cells by deaminating cytosine to uracil. The paper shows that AID is regulated by cell cycle and that the efficiency of this regulation differs in different stages of the cell cycle. AID is most stable in G1 phase, where it promotes immunoglobulin gene diversification and class switching recombination without compromising cell viability. AID undergoes nuclear proteolysis in S and G2/M phases, but is more rapidly degraded in G1 phase. AID is also regulated by phosphorylation at specific sites, particularly Ser3 and Thr27, which affects its stability and activity. The paper identifies two mechanisms that regulate AID stability and activity: phosphorylation at Ser3 downregulates immunoglobulin gene diversification and protein phosphorylation at Thr27 promotes it. The paper also shows that AID activity in G1 phase can tolerate higher levels of nuclear AID compared to S and G2/M phases, which may reflect the relative efficiency of repair of AID-initiated nicks in G1 phase. The paper identifies cell cycle tags that can regulate AID nuclear stability, including CDT1 and GEM tags, which restrict AID to G1 phase. The paper also identifies a catalytically inactive AID mutant that is less stable and exhibits reduced abundance. The paper concludes that cell cycle regulation of AID may promote AID-initiated mutagenesis in cancer by dysregulating its nuclear stability.
This paper describes a comprehensive approach to identify the genes directly regulated by the trichome regulators GL3 and GL1 in Arabidopsis. The authors used a combination of ChIP-chip experiments, candidate gene approaches and genome-wide expression analyses to identify direct targets of GL3 and GL1. They found 53 genes that are directly regulated by GL3 and GL1, including some that express before any morphological changes associated with epidermal cell differentiation, suggesting early functions in trichome initiation. They also found that GL3 and GL1 targets genes peak at different stages, with early genes expressing within the first few hours of GL3/GL1 induction and later genes expressing at later stages. The genes identified include transcription factors, regulators and enzymes involved in endoreduplication, metabolism and cellular communication. The results provide a first blueprint for the regulatory network involved in trichome formation and highlight novel regulatory functions for GL3 and GL1.
The paper investigates the cellular tropism of Orientia tsugamushi in the skin eschar of patients with scrub typhus, with the aim of understanding how the organism disseminates from the local inoculation site. The authors found that within the eschar, Orientia tsugamushi primarily infects monocytes/macrophages and dermal dendritic cells, rather than endothelial cells. The study provides evidence that monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells act as antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and are the main target cells for Orientia tsugamushi infection early in the disease course, and that endothelial cells are not a common site of infection. The authors also observed membranous protrusions forming in the cytoplasm of infected monocyte/macrophages and dendritic cells, which may represent degenerating Orientia tsugamushi. The findings suggest that monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells are the primary source of replication and dissemination of Orientia tsugamushi, with possible intracellular spreading to lymph nodes and other organs through activated dendritic cells. The study highlights the need for further studies to determine the cellular tropism of Orientia in the lymph nodes and other organs following dissemination, as this will contribute to a better understanding of the immunopathophysiology of scrub typhus.
This paper describes a genetic mouse model of a rare mitochondrial disorder caused by a mutation in the Slc25a46 gene. Mice with the mutation display neurological symptoms including ataxia, optic atrophy and cerebellar hypoplasia. The mutant mice have a premature stop codon in the Slc25a46 gene that results in a truncated protein. The mutation is rescued by expression of the human ortholog, providing genetic confirmation for the causality of the mutation. The paper examines the cerebellar histopathology of the mutant mice, which shows disrupted cytoarchitecture, neuroinflammation and lymphoid abnormalities. The authors also show that expression of the human Slc25a46 protein in the mutant mice reverses the neurological symptoms and cerebellar histopathology. The study provides a valid mouse model for studying the human pathology caused by Slc25a46 mutations. The mutation affects mitochondrial dynamics and cristae maintenance in the cerebellum, leading to changes in mitochondrial protein levels and the mitochondrial interactome. The study highlights the importance of studying Slc25a46 and its role in mitochondrial metabolism to understand the associated neuropathology.
This paper discusses the recent history of rabies outbreaks in China, particularly in the northwest regions of China, and the need for better control measures to prevent spread of the disease to humans. Rabies has been a continuous threat since 1940s, with three major epidemics. While the number of human deaths has decreased in recent years, the virus is still spreading in previously rabies-free regions, mainly through bites from stray dogs and wild foxes. While vaccination of domestic animals is recommended by the World Organization for Animal Health, there is currently no local vaccine available for stray dogs or wild animals, and most large livestock cases are treated as accidents. The paper reports rabies outbreaks in cattle and camels in northwest China, indicating the need for vaccination of both stray dogs and wild foxes to prevent future spread to humans. The study showed that a single dose of canine rabies vaccine can induce protective antibodies in cattle and camels, but licensed vaccines for large animals are needed for widespread use. The paper concludes that more research is needed on oral vaccines for dogs and foxes to control rabies in China, and regular surveillance of cross-border transmission is required.
This paper aims to advance genomics-based methods for understanding ecological associations between microbes. The authors introduce two novel indices to quantify microbe-microbe interaction: genome content similarity and microbe-microbe functional association. They show that these indices predict associations between microbes in different environments and can explain up to 4% of the variance in microbial co-occurrence, even when accounting for phylogenetic relationships between the organisms. The results indicate that genome content information explains more of the variance than previously proposed metabolic competition and complementarity indices constructed from KEGG pathways. The study also identifies gene sets that are associated with co-occurrence of certain microbes, which could be used to further investigate the mechanisms driving the associations. The authors argue that while the proposed indices have limitations, they provide a handle on the mechanisms driving microbial community assembly and dynamics, complementing conclusions from ecological surveys, and may help draw conclusions for microbes from poorly sampled communities.
The paper investigates the role of the cytoplasmic protein septin Septin in cell division, specifically in the context of hematopoietic cells vs. non-adherent cells. The authors find that while Septin is required for cytokinesis in adherent cells, it is dispensable in hematopoietic cells that grow in suspension. In hematopoietic cells, an abundance of the protein Stathmin is sufficient to enable cytokinesis without Septin. The abundance of Stathmin in early embryonic cells may explain the ability of hematopoietic cells to proliferate without Septin. The authors suggest that the combination of Septin and Stathmin is critical for completing cytokinesis and midbody abscission. The findings provide evidence that there are two distinct types of cell division mechanisms in mammalian cells, one for adherent cells that requires Septin for the contractile ring and another for hematopoietic cells that can proceed without Septin. The study provides a potential target for cancer therapy selective for hematopoietic cells.
The paper explores the genetic diversity of glycosyltransferases (gtr) in Salmonella enterica, which are responsible for modifying the lipopolysacrysin (LPS) molecule and are associated with different serogroups according to the standard Salmonella classification. The authors use genomic analysis, phylogenetic analysis and functional assays to identify 59 gtr operons in Salmonella genomes, which are clustered into 10 gtrC families. However, the gtrC genes do not correlate with the standard Salmonella serogroup classification. They find that gtrC genes are associated with bacteriophage genomes and are often present in multiple serogroups, while gtrA and gtrB genes have low sequence similarity but high amino acid similarity. They show that gtrC genes are subject to phase variation, which allows for different gtr operons to be expressed in different serovars, and this leads to additional LPS modifications that are not reflected in the standard serotyping scheme. The authors propose that gtr-dependent LPS modifications contribute to Salmonella virulence, persistence and spread, and that more sophisticated serotyping methods are needed to detect this diversity. The findings suggest that gtr genes are important for understanding Salmonella biology and may impact vaccine development.
This paper investigates the in vivo activity of the plant alkaloid epipodophyllotoxin (EPI) against Schistosoma mansoni in mice. The study found that a single dose of 40 mg/kg of EPI significantly reduced the total worm burden and egg laying in infected mice, with 30 and 100 mg/kg doses showing moderate reductions. However, the 8000 mg/kg dose caused toxicity and death. EPI had a high pKa value indicating it is safe at physiological pH. In vitro, EPI was less potent against S. mansoni, but the 40 mg/kg dose in vivo showed a reasonable efficacy. EPI reduced hepatosplenomegaly and egg burden, indicating its potential as a treatment for schistosomiasis. The mechanism of action is likely through damage to the tegument of the parasite, which can lead to immune system attack. Further studies are needed to fully understand the efficacy and safety of EPI as a potential drug.
This paper investigates the RNA remodeling activities of enterovirus 2CATPase, a protein that encodes an RNA helicase and RNA chaperone. The paper finds that 2CATPase possesses both RNA helicase and chaperone activities, but the two activities are distinct. The RNA helicase activity of 2CATPase requires ATP hydrolysis, while the RNA chaperone activity does not. The RNA helicase activity of 2CATPase unwinds RNA helices in an ATP-dependent manner, while the chaperone activity unwind RNA helices bidirectionally in the absence of ATP. The study shows that 2CATPase can function as both a helicase and chaperone in the same RNA molecule, which is intriguing. The paper uses various biochemical, cellular and in vitro assays to demonstrate the RNA remodeling activities of 2CATPase and their potential roles in enteroviral RNA replication. The results provide evidence that the two types of RNA remodeling activities, RNA helicase and ATP-independent chaperoning, can be integrated within one protein. This study increases our understanding of enteroviruses and the two types of RNA remodeling activities.
This paper investigates the auxin signaling system in the liverwort plant Marchantia polymorpha. The authors find that Marchantia has a minimal but complete auxin-mediated transcriptional regulation system, with a single AUX/IAA protein (MpIAA), one TIR1/AFB protein (MpTIR1), and three ARF proteins (MpARF1, MpARF2, and MpARF3). They show that MpIAA functions as an auxin receptor that conveys auxin signaling through domain II, similar to Arabidopsis AUX/IAA. They demonstrate that MpIAA regulates various developmental processes in Marchantia, including cell elongation and differentiation, and that repression of MpIAA-mediated auxin signaling inhibits sporophy development. The authors propose that Marchantia possesses a simple auxin-mediated transcriptional system that may provide insights into the evolution and mechanisms of morphogenesis controlled by auxin. The study suggests that the single-copy existence of the activator ARF in Marchantia may allow outputs to be determined by protein interactions rather than specific target sites, providing evidence for the "impetus" model where auxin provides an initial signal that is modulated by different ARFs. Overall, the study demonstrates that Marchantia has a minimal but functional auxin signaling system that can regulate diverse developmental processes.
The paper describes an investigation into the function of Ca2+ homeostasis in apicomplexan parasites, specifically the Plasmodium falciparum and Toxoplasma gondii. The authors used a heterologous expression system in yeast to study the functional characterization of two Ca2+-exchanging proteins, PfCAX and TgCAX. They found that PfCAX is a Ca2+/H+ exchanger that localizes to the tonoplast and is required for protection against extracellular Ca2+ levels during sexual development, specifically during ookinete conversion. TgCAX localizes to a large vesicular-like structure and may localize to a novel vacuolar compartment. The results suggest that Ca2+/H+ exchange proteins play a role in providing tolerance to environmental Ca2+ levels in apicomplexan parasites, which is essential during extracellular stages but not during asexual development. The findings provide insight into the potential regulation of Ca2+ homeostasis in these parasites and could aid the development of transmission-blocking therapies that target Ca2+-changing proteins, which are required for parasite transmission.
The paper evaluates the prevalence of intestinal helminths among schoolchildren in three primary schools in Ikenne Local Government Area, Nigeria, focusing on demographic features, hygiene conditions and factors that influence the development of sustainable school health programs. It found that the prevalence of intestinal helminths was higher in government-owned urban and rural schools than in the private school, with the most common species being Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura and hookworm. The study suggests that poor sanitation and hygiene conditions in government schools, including inadequate water supply, unsanitary latrines and garbage accumulation around the schools, contribute to the higher prevalence of infections. The study recommends a multi-intervention school health program that includes periodic deworming, basic amenities and health education, addressing water supply and sanitation issues in government schools, and collaboration between local health officials and school management to initiate and implement such programs.
The paper proposes a learning system that uses a hierarchical Slow Feature Analysis (SFA) network to autonomously extract relevant features from high-dimensional sensory inputs, followed by a simple reward-based learning algorithm to make decisions based on those features. The SFA network is trained using unsupervised learning rules that exploit the temporal continuity of important features, and reduces the dimensionality of the input data. The resulting state representation is then used by a subsequent neural network that performs reinforcement learning to make decisions based on the extracted features. The authors test the system on two control tasks: navigating through a maze and reaching a target object in a complex environment. They show that the SFA network is able to extract relevant features that allow the subsequent learning system to solve the tasks, even though the input data is high-dimensional and complex. The results suggest that autonomous extraction of relevant features through SFA may be an important unsupervised learning mechanism in the brain, and could potentially form the basis of efficient state representations for behavioral learning.
The paper discusses the concept of "self-containment" in RNA molecules, which refers to their ability to maintain their specific folded structure regardless of the surrounding sequence. The authors analyze this property in various RNA molecules and find that miRNAs, which undergo a biogenesis pathway that requires structural robustness, exhibit a significantly higher degree of self-containment compared to other RNA classes. They propose that this property is an evolved feature of miRNAs that allows them to be modular units that can function in different genomic contexts. The ability of miRNAs to maintain their structure through multiple cleavage steps and genomic instability of surrounding sequences suggests that self-containment may provide a mechanism to buffer against genetic perturbations and modular composition in combinatorial contexts. The high self-containment of miRNAs is also found to be associated with other characteristics like family membership and genomic location, which are important for their function. The authors argue that understanding self-containment properties of RNAs is fundamental to understanding how RNAs can be modular molecules, allowing large RNAs to be decomposed into structurally robust building blocks that can be swapped out or rearranged.
The paper presents an updated version of the qFit algorithm called qFit 2.0, which can model peptide flips and glycine conformations that were previously unaccounted for. qFit 2.0 uses electron density to identify alternative conformations for backbone atoms like the carbonyl oxygen atom, and not just the Cβ atom. This allows it to identify peptide flips that occur outside of α-helices and β-sheets, which were previously difficult to model. By sampling conformations based on the carbonyl oxygen atom, qFit 2.0 can discover more discrete backbone conformational changes like peptide flips. qFit 2.0 also fits conformers based on the backbone atom for glycines, enabling it to model more flexible glycine conformations. The results show that qFit 2.0 models more backbone conformational heterogeneity and identifies more alternative sidechain rotamers compared to the original qFit. This suggests that the backbone and sidechain degrees of freedom in proteins are coupled, and subtle backbone motions can facilitate rotamer changes. The authors propose future work to model larger backbone conformational changes like helix shear, adjustments of entire α-helices and correlated β-sheet flexing. The approach is shown to be effective at identifying peptide flips and glycine conformations in both synthetic and experimental crystal structures, and can help uncover the role of conformational heterogeneity in protein function.
The paper describes the discovery of a new metabolic pathway in the parasite Trypanosoma brucei that is responsible for the activity of benzoxaboroles, a class of drugs that contain a benzoxaborole core and a variety of substituents. The researchers used a genome-scale loss-of-function screen to identify genes that are required for the activity of these drugs. They found that a protein called TbALDH3 encodes a trypanosomal FAD-like enzyme that likely functions as the enzyme in the pathway. They also showed that TbALDH3 contributes to an oxidative deamination pathway that is initiated by host AO activity and is required for full activity of the benzoxaboroles. The findings suggest that the drug metabolism mechanism uncovered here could be exploited to improve the potency of these drugs. The study highlights the possibility of similar metabolic pathways existing in other pathogens and broader medical conditions, and that the oxidative deamination reaction could be mediated by AOs in plasma. The researchers also demonstrated that carboxylate derivatives of the drugs are less potent than their methylamine-containing counterparts due to poor membrane permeability, but still exhibit activity against the parasite. The results provide insight into the mechanism of action of the drugs and potential strategies for improving their efficacy.
The paper discusses how exonic mutations in the MLH1 gene can disrupt splicing, leading to disease. The MLH1 gene has a high number of splicing mutations in its exon 10, mostly affecting potential exonic splicing regulatory elements (ESRs). The authors used minigenes and in silico tools to evaluate the impact of these mutations on splicing. They found that the in silico tools ΔtESRseq and ΔHZEI were best at predicting variants that disrupt splicing regulatory elements, while the ΔΨ tool did not. The authors conclude that in silico methods can be used to prioritize variants for functional testing, but that the ΔtESRseq and ΔHZEI approaches are suitable for identifying exonic variants that disrupt splicing. They also observed that MLH1 exon 10 splicing mutations that increase inclusion of the exon have a protective effect, while mutations that skip exon 10 have an unknown clinical impact. The results suggest that in silico prediction of splicing alterations can help identify disease-causing variants, and the high number of splicing mutations in MLH1 exon 10 highlights the importance of studying splicing in genetic diseases.
This paper proposes a new approach to screen genome-wide association studies and genome-wide allelic scores to identify causal relationships between biological intermediates and disease. The basic idea is to use genome-wide allelic scores constructed from hundreds or thousands of anonymous SNPs that relate to a biological intermediate of interest, and test whether these allelic scores are associated with disease status. The authors show that genome-wide allelic scores can explain non-trivial proportions of variance in biological intermediates like body mass index, C-reactive protein and low density lipoprotein levels, even when known variants are excluded from their construction. They demonstrate that using genome-wide allelic scores can identify causal relationships between biological intermediates and disease, even when there are no known variants underlying the intermediate. However, the approach has limitations due to genetic pleiotropy and lack of specificity, and the results need to be interpreted with caution. The authors suggest that genome-wide allelic scores can be used as a screening tool to identify putative causal relationships, which can then be followed up with more rigorous methods like Mendelian randomization. They propose extending this approach to examine hundreds of thousands of molecular phenotypes, like transcriptomic, metabolomic and methylomic data, using genome-wide association studies.
The paper discusses the similarities and differences between host defense peptides (HDPs) derived from mammals and those derived from helminths (parasitic worms). HDPs from mammals have been shown to have both antimicrobial and immune modulatory functions, such as inhibiting bacterial growth and activating immune cells. However, the helminth-derived HDPs in this study did not demonstrate bactericidal activity against any bacteria, even at high concentrations. Instead, they exhibited immune modulatory functions like their mammalian counterparts, inhibiting TNF production from macrophages and enhancing IgG1 secretion. The authors suggest that helminths have evolved to retain immune modulatory functions while losing antimicrobial activity to prevent host cell death during infection. This adaptation may have allowed helminths to establish a long-term parasitic lifestyle in their mammalian hosts. The immune-modulatory properties of helminth-derived HDPs provide an opportunity for developing novel immunotherapeptides for microbial infections and immune-related disorders, as they are non-cytotoxic.
This paper presents the results of a randomized controlled trial comparing community-based adherence clubs for stable HIV patients versus clinic-based adherence clubs. The study found that community-based adherence clubs had significantly higher loss from club-based care, with 52% of participants lost to club-based care versus 43% for clinic-based adherence clubs. The most common reason for loss from club-based care was missing a club visit and associated medication pickup. The study suggests that convenience, scheduling logistics, and perceived stigma may have contributed to the difference in outcomes between the two interventions. The study found that clinic-based adherence clubs had lower loss from any ART care, with 72% reengaging within 90 days, compared to 78% for community-based adherence clubs. The study highlights the importance of examining retention in club-based care as an outcome, as the intervention requires significant clinic resources and patient participation. The findings suggest that community-based adherence clubs may not be as effective as previously thought, particularly given the logistical challenges of organizing and running clubs. The study had limitations related to follow-up duration, treatment assignment, and generalizability to other settings.
The paper discusses the biological differences between Trypanosoma cruzi isolates belonging to different genetic types (DTUs) TcI and TcIV, which were obtained from patients in the Amazon region of Brazil. The TcIV isolates were found to be more virulent than TcI isolates, causing higher parasitemia and mortality in mice, especially in the acute phase. However, TcI isolates caused more severe inflammation and tissue parasitism in mice. TcIV isolates had lower parasitemia but showed incipient pathogenicity. The results suggest that the biological and medical properties of TcIV isolates from the Amazon region are important for understanding the clinical epidemiology of Chagas disease in the Amazon context. The study highlights the need to consider the phylogenetic diversity of T. cruzi in emergent areas, as the biological differences between the two DTUs were found to be proportional to their evolutionary divergence. The paper concludes that the potential of TcIV isolates in terms of severity and clinical manifestations in humans remains to be determined, and more studies are needed to determine how TcIV isolates behave in humans.
This paper analyzes genetic data from 110667 individuals from 111 disease cohorts and 3 control groups to investigate the role of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in complex diseases. The authors found that while the haplogroup structure of mtDNA makes it difficult to identify the specific variants responsible for disease associations, higher resolution genotyping at the whole mtDNA genome level can provide further insight into the underlying genetic mechanisms. They identified several mtDNA variants associated with an increased risk of developing multiple diseases, including Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, ulcerative colitis, schizophrenia and type 2 diabetes. These variants were found to be located in genes involved in the electron transport chain complexes I and IV and ribosomal genes. The authors suggest that deleterious variants may not have been removed from the population through natural selection and may have different effects depending on the haplogroup background. The study underscores the importance of incorporating mtDNA into comprehensive genetic association studies to better understand the role of mitochondrial mechanisms in common diseases.
The paper describes the development and validation of two new ELISA tests, the BLACKBOX CCHV IgM and BLACKBOX CCHV IgG, for the detection of Crimean Hemorrhagic Fever virus (CCHV) infections. The tests use a recombinant CCHV nucleoprotein antigen produced in E. coli as the antigen. The BLACKBOX CCHV IgM test detects CCHV IgM antibodies and is suitable for early detection of acute cases, while the BLACKBOX CCHV IgG test detects IgG antibodies and is better suited for seroprevalence studies. Both tests showed high sensitivity and specificity in detecting CCHV antibodies in sera from Kosovo patients, with the BLACKBOX CCHV IgG test showing higher sensitivity for detecting IgG antibodies in early samples. The results suggest that the BLACKBOX CCHV IgG test may be useful for detecting low levels of IgG antibodies in early stages of infection, while the BLACKBOX CCHV IgM test may be more useful for diagnosing acute cases. The use of a recombinant antigen simplifies production and reduces costs compared to native antigen production.
The paper argues that while there has been a lot of progress in analyzing ecological networks, there is currently no reliable method to determine the type of interaction being represented by an ecological network, such as mutualistic or antagonistic. The authors show that classifying nonecological networks is easy, but ecological networks are much more difficult to classify, even using spectral measures like eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix. They propose the problem as a challenge to the network analysis community, arguing that a solution would provide insights into ecological systems that would be hard to gain otherwise, and could enable new applications of network analysis. However, they note that ecological networks are typically unweighted and bipartite, and many ecological networks quantify interactions at the level of the number of visits or the number of interactions rather than the types of interactions, which makes it hard to classify. They propose a solution that would extend network metrics to weighted, multidimensional networks and account for within-class variation. They also suggest that the difference between mutualistic and antagonistic networks may not be the main driver of network structure and other classifications could emerge that are easy to infer from network structure. Ultimately, a failure to find a solution could be due to a combination of reasons.
The paper discusses how the Reovirus FAST proteins, which are small fusion proteins that lack their own adhesion capacity, are able to mediate cell-cell fusion by exploiting surrogate adhesion factors like cadherins and actin remodeling. The FAST proteins contain within their minimal structures all the activities necessary to mediate cell-cell fusion, but in their natural context as cell-cell fusogens, they use surrogate adhesion factors to achieve higher levels of fusion. This is the first example of a membrane fusion machine that has specifically evolved to utilize surrogate, non-cognate adhesion factors. The results suggest that the FAST proteins contain within their minimal structures all the necessary activities to efficiently mediate cell-cell fusion but exploit surrogate adhesion factors to achieve higher levels of activity. The FAST proteins are reliant on surrogate adhesion factors to mediate the earliest stages of the fusion reaction, which is distinct from the enveloped virus fusion machines that use spatial relationships between the binding and fusion components to trigger the reaction.
This paper investigates the evolutionary history and function of L1TD1, a retrotransposon-derived protein that plays a role in pluripotency maintenance in human embryonic stem cells. The authors find that L1TD1 has evolved under positive selection in primates and mice, suggesting that it may have been domesticated as an anti-L1 restriction factor and later recruited for pluripotency regulation. They propose that L1TD1 was originally domesticated to restrict L1 retrotransposition in the germline and early embryonic tissues, where L1 retrotransposition is most active. However, the loss of L1 activity in some mammalian lineages led to the loss of L1TD1, except in species that still have active L1s. The bushbaby-derived partial replacement of L1TD1 with a more recent L1 ORF1 suggests that LTD1 may have acquired a new function that conferred a selective advantage. The authors propose that LTD1 may have evolved to restrict L1 elements themselves, either through interfering with homotrimerization or competing with L1 ORF1p for binding to ORF2p. They also suggest that LTD1 may act as a dominant negative version of ORF1p, or through post-transcriptional silencing of L1 elements. The paper highlights the opportunistic nature of retroelement domestication and how genetic innovation and loss can occur in mammalian genomes, providing a window into the evolution of new functions from mobile elements like L1 retrotransposons.
The paper describes the cloning of a gene, GmACP1, that is associated with phosphorus efficiency in soybean. The authors used linkage mapping, genome-wide association mapping, and candidate gene association mapping to identify GmACP1 as the phosphatase gene that is associated with phosphorus efficiency in soybean. They found that GmACP1 is upregulated in response to low phosphorus stress and that overexpression of GmACP1 leads to increased phosphorus uptake and utilization in soybean roots, indicating it plays a key role in regulating phosphorus efficiency. They identified favorable haplotypes of GmACP1 that are associated with high phosphorus efficiency and developed markers for breeding programs. The study demonstrates that cloning a phosphorus efficiency gene is an effective strategy for improving phosphorus efficiency in soybean and other plants.
This paper describes a study that analyzed genetic mutations in patients with early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) and sporadic EOAD. They found that 10 novel missense mutations and 1 novel indel were identified in the PSEN1, PSEN2, and APP genes in 18/129 sporadic cases with an age of onset below 51 years. The study found that 5 de novo PSEN1 mutations occurred, which is less than expected based on previous studies. They conclude that including patients with sporadic presentation and early onset age in genetic screening is important for accurately classifying genetic mutations and informing offspring. However, many mutations remain insufficiently characterized and functional assessment is needed to classify variants. They suggest that de novo mutations in other genes may also play a role in sporadic EOAD. The findings highlight the need to systematically include patients with sporadic presentation and early onset age in genetic screening and emphasize the importance of classifying variants to provide accurate genetic counseling.
The paper describes an experiment to study the role of the transcription factor Ultraspiracle (USP) in regulating the age at which honey bees initiate foraging. USP was shown to delay the age at which bees initiate foraging when knocked down through RNA interference. This suggests that USP has a causal effect on honey bee behavioral maturation. The study found that USP regulates behavior through interactions with other transcription factors, likely through a complex transcriptional regulatory network. USP binds genomic regions near genes encoding other transcription factors, and its genomic binding sites were enriched for multiple cis-regulatory motifs recognized by distinct classes of transcription factors. The study found that USP binds the same genomic locations in nurse and forager fat bodies, but only a subset of USP targets are associated with maturation. USP likely mediates responses to Juvenile Hormone (JH) as part of a complex of proteins assembled at the promoters of JH-responsive genes. The study provides evidence that transcriptional mechanisms underlie the coordinated peripheral and neuronal changes that occur during honey bee maturation, and that USP functions in honey bee maturation by mechanisms similar to those known in other species. The study suggests that many transcription factors are involved in behavioral maturation, and that a complex transcriptional network mediates the effects of USP on behavior.
The paper investigates the role of the TGFβ signaling pathway and Src kinase pathway in the reproductive cycle of the parasitic flatworm Schistosoma mansoni. The study shows that both signaling pathways are involved in regulating the transcription of genes involved in egg production, with TGβ signaling having a stronger effect. The TGFβ pathway activates a number of genes involved in eggshell formation, while the Src kinase pathway represses these genes. The study used microarray analysis and qPCR to detect differentially expressed genes following treatment with inhibitors of TGβ signaling or Src kinase. The results confirm that both pathways are involved in regulating egg production in a cooperative manner, with TGβ signaling having a stronger effect. The study also identifies a number of genes involved in calcium signaling as potential targets of the TGFβ pathway. The findings suggest that the TGFβ pathway may play a more important role in regulating egg production in Schistosoma mansoni, providing new insights into the mechanisms of reproduction in this parasite and potential targets for drug development.
The paper proposes a non-invasive framework for assessing cardiovascular risk in hemodialysis patients based on analyzing pulse waveform recordings from a peripheral artery. The authors show that the framework can correctly identify increased arterial stiffness in hemodialysis patients, which is accompanied by a decrease in pulse wave velocity, as observed in clinical studies. The framework uses a model to simulate pulse wave propagation in a bifurcating binary tree of arteries based on a patient's peripheral pressure recording. The authors show that the model can estimate parameters such as arterial stiffness, cardiac output, and sub-endocardial viability ratio from the pulse waveform, which are related to the patient's cardiovascular state. The results suggest that the framework can provide more accurate and personalized information about the patient's cardiovascular state compared to standard pulse wave analysis, which relies on simultaneous electrocardiography and pressure recordings. The study also shows that the framework can identify hemodialysis-induced changes in the derived indices, such as augmentation index and sub-endocardial viability ratio, which are related to changes in blood circulation during the treatment session. The limitations of the study include the potential impact of arteriovenous fistula and the limited number of parameters that can be estimated from the peripheral pressure profile. However, the results suggest that the framework has the potential to provide valuable information for assessing cardiovascular risk in hemodialysis patients.
The paper describes a novel model of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in Drosophila melanogaster, which involves oral infection of the flies with the bacteria in the crop, resulting in formation of biofilms. The authors show that biofilm infections cause increased bacterial dissemination to the hemolymph and induce AMP genes in the flies, while non-biofilm infections do not. The authors also demonstrate that biofilm infections are associated with increased virulence and decreased survival of the flies, while non-biofilm infections are associated with faster survival. The model suggests that biofilms may act as a specific host immune signal to induce AMP genes and slow bacterial dissemination, while EPS may induce inflammation in the crop/GI system. The study provides insights into the host-pathogen interaction during biofilm infections and has the potential to increase understanding of the relationship between biofilms and the host during infection.
This paper aims to validate the potential of inhibitors of the enzyme CYP5 as a target for treating Naegleria fowleri infections, which cause primary amoebic meningoencephalitis in humans. The authors first validate that CYP5 is an essential enzyme in N. fowleri by showing that inhibition of CYP5 leads to growth inhibition of trophozoites. They then determine the endogenous substrate of CYP5 and characterize drug-target interactions using UV-vis and X-ray crystallography. They find that CYP5 inhibitors bind to CYP5 with higher affinity than the natural substrate 31-norlanosterol, which explains their higher potency against N. fowleri. They also show that the potency of CYP5 inhibitors against N. fowleri correlates with their lipophilicity and molecular weight, with more lipophilic drugs having higher potency. They then measure the growth inhibition of N. fowleri trophozites exposed to different CYP5 inhibitors at different time points and find that exposure to posaconazole leads to ultrastructural changes consistent with lipid disruption. They purify and characterize the recombinant CYP5 enzyme and determine its drug-target interactions. Overall, the authors conclude that CYP5 inhibitors have potential as a treatment for N. fowleri infections, but more work is needed to determine their efficacy in animal models and to validate the results in humans.
The paper describes a pilot project to control cystic hydatid disease (CHD) in two counties in Xinjiang, China by focusing on eliminating the release of Echinocococcus granulosis eggs from dogs. The strategy involved monthly treatment of all dogs with praziquantel (PZQ) to prevent the worms from reaching maturity and infecting newborn animals. The pilot program was successful in reducing the prevalence of E. granulos in dogs and newborn sheep by 90-100% and 95% respectively after 4 years, with a cost of around $1.2 per dog per year. Dog culling was also carried out to reduce the number of intermediate hosts. The results showed that the strategy was effective and accepted by both Han Chinese and Uygur Muslim communities. The use of a village hydatid disease control officer (VHDCO) in each village helped to ensure proper treatment and registration of dogs. The number of stray and unwanted dogs was also reduced. The authors conclude that treating dogs monthly with PZQ is an efficient, cost-effective and practicable measure for controlling CHD in rural areas, especially during the time when farmers return to their villages.
The paper finds that intrauterine growth restriction, measured by low birth weight for gestational age, is associated with increased mortality throughout childhood. The study examines the relationship between severe and moderate intrauterine growth restriction (SGA) and mortality rates in over 3.7 million Swedish children born between 1973 and 2012. The study finds that severe SGA (<3rd percentile) is associated with a 2.58-fold increased mortality risk compared to non-SGA children, while moderate SGA (3rd to 10th percentile) is associated with a 1.37-fold increased mortality risk. The association is strongest between 28 days and 1 year of age, and declines with age. The study also finds that severe SGA is associated with a 3-4 fold increased risk of death due to infection, while moderate SGA has a 1.6-fold increase. The study concludes that preventive measures such as smoking cessation, nutritional support, and careful monitoring of fetal growth in pregnancy may be needed to reduce the mortality risk in SGA children. The findings suggest that even in high-income countries like Sweden, mortality rates under 5 years of age may be reduced through active follow-up and targeted interventions.
The paper describes a theoretical framework for exploring the combined sequence and conformational space of peptides interacting with a given peptide-binding pocket. The method uses a multisequence Monte Carlo (MC) approach which simulates a joint probability distribution in conformation and sequence space, allowing for efficient search through sequence space. The method relies on two approximations: that the unbound state consists of a free protein and a free peptide, and a linear approximation of the unbound state free energy. The authors test the method on 3 different PDZ domains with distinct peptide-binding specificities. They find good agreement with both full protein-peptide simulations and experimental binding affinities, indicating that the approximations do not strongly impact the results. They also obtain specificity profiles for each domain, revealing the peptide-binding preferences. They also show that the peptide screening method can be used to discover new peptide-binding pockets on protein structures, providing a rough estimate of the peptide-binding properties. The approach provides an efficient way to sample the peptide-binding specificity space and analyze the interplay between conformational flexibility and binding specificity of the peptide chain.
The paper assesses the impact of a Chagas disease vector control program in the Department of Cochamba, Bolivia on triatomine bug infestation rates. The program used pyrethroid insecticides to spray houses in at-risk areas. The authors found that infestation rates significantly decreased in the early years of the program, with a 28% reduction in infestation odds for each 10-fold increase in insecticide use. However, infestation rates remained relatively high in some areas, indicating the presence of residual infestation foci. The program had an immediate impact on dwelling infestation, with infestation rates plummeting by 80-90% in the first two assessment years. However, infestation rates remained stable after 2004, indicating that residual infestation was still present. The authors suggest that residual infestation was likely due to wild vector populations and will require long-term vector control measures. They note that residual infestation is a major issue that will require specific policy and action. The results demonstrate the importance of long-term entomological-epidemiological surveillance to monitor and address residual infestation foci. The findings highlight the need for sustained and coordinated vector control measures in areas where Chagas disease is highly endemic, particularly in areas with widespread wild vector populations.
The paper presents a biophysically motivated model for quantitatively measuring genome accessibility in bacteria, which is an important factor in transcription factor binding. The model formulates the binding process as a Boltzmann distribution that depends on two parameters: genome accessibility and binding affinity. The accessibility parameter represents how likely a region is to be bound by a transcription factor, while the affinity parameter represents the specific affinity between a factor and the region. The authors use a linear mixed effects regression model to estimate the model parameters from ChIP-seq data, which is more efficient than a naive least squares approach. They show that genome accessibility explains more of the variability in ChIP-seq coverage and peaks than just affinity alone. They also find that genome accessibility is associated with different functional categories of genes, such as intergenic regions, and is positively correlated with gene expression. The model provides a framework for predicting TF binding under novel growth conditions or for TFs with known binding motifs. The authors suggest that genome accessibility could be used to test hypotheses and provide new insights into gene regulation in bacteria, and that more refined models integrating additional factors like cooperativity and multiplicity could enhance our understanding of gene regulation.
This paper presents evidence that bony fishes, including lungfish, paddlefish, and sharks, generate their pelvic muscles using a developmental mechanism that is intermediate between the primitive and derived modes of appendicular muscle formation seen in chondrichthyans and tetrapods. The study found that in bony fishes, the pelvic muscles are generated by direct epithelial extension of the myotome, which is headed by an epithelial bud that progressively generates the muscle of the body wall, and then enters the fin mesenchyme to form individual pelvic muscles. This is similar to how pectoral muscles are generated in bony fishes, but differs from the derived mode of limb muscle formation seen in tetrapods, where limb myoblasts migrate from the ventral somite and express lbx1. The authors conclude that this bimodal character, which combines elements of both the primitive and derived mechanisms, likely facilitated the evolution of tetrapod limb muscle development. They propose that the novel pelvic muscle development in bony fishes allowed the pelvic fin to be positioned independently of the hypaxial muscle of the body wall, freeing it to move with the pelvic girdle and hindlimbs during the tetrapod transition, which was critical for terrestrial locomotion. The study provides evidence that the evolution of the fully derived limb muscle mechanism seen in tetrapods was an important innovation for their success.
The paper presents a multi-scale simulation approach to model the insertion of iPLA2 enzymes into phospholipid bilayers at the membrane surface. The authors use coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CG) simulations to generate an initial protein structure, followed by atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to refine the model and equilibrate the protein-membrane complex. They find that the protein insertion angle and depth are finely tuned to facilitate rapid turnover, with the hydrophobic residues anchoring the protein to the membrane. The amphipathic helix region acts as the anchor. The results agree well with deuterium exchange experiments showing that the cavity is often transiently occupied by a lipid extracted from the membrane. The study complements previous work demonstrating the utility of a multi-resolution approach for predicting the surface location of PLA2 enzymes. The flexible loops that form the cavity regulate the active site accessibility. The results suggest that the membrane can be considered as a ligand for PLA2 enzymes, leading to a conformational change and the amphipathic helix may act as a membrane interaction site. The study provides a novel mechanism for the extraction of phospholipids from the membrane. The approach could help design new inhibitors of iPLA2 with improved potency and selectivity.
The paper investigates the role of rapid apoptosis as an innate immune response against viral infection in Drosophila melanogaster. The authors found that rapid induction of pro-apoptotic genes, such as reaper and hid, is a general phenomenon that can be observed in both DNA viruses (AcMNPV) and RNA viruses (FHV), following infection in vivo. This rapid induction is dependent on the function of p53 and a regulatory region called IRER. They showed that blocking apoptosis in infected cells leads to increased susceptibility to systemic infection, while allowing rapid induction of apoptosis in infected cells denies the opportunity for viral gene expression. The rapid induction of apoptosis is capable of blocking viral infection at its initiation stage when the animals are exposed to relatively small amounts of virus, potentially contributing to the "midgut infection barrier" that has been observed for arbovirus transmission through insect vectors. The results suggest that rapid induction of apoptosis is an important immune response in Drosophila that may play a role in limiting the establishment and proliferation of viruses, particularly in susceptible insects.
The paper explores the role of two enzymes, RAD52 and POLQ, in genome maintenance and response to DNA damage. The authors find that RAD52 is important for repair of longer homology-directed repair (HDR) events that require removal of a non-homologous sequence, while POLQ promotes repair of shorter oligonucleotide microhomology-templated repair events. They find that RAD52 is dispensable for other types of repair, such as end joining (EJ) events, while POLQ has a greater effect on EJ events. They also find that disruption of both RAD52 and POLQ causes a decrease in replication fork velocity and sensitivity to genotoxins, suggesting that the two factors have distinct roles in chromosomal break repair. However, combined disruption of RAD52 and POLQ does not appear to generate a synthetic defect in these events, suggesting that the two factors have distinct roles. Their findings indicate that RAD52 is important for longer repair events that require removal of a non-homologous sequence, while POLQ promotes repair of shorter events that require nascent DNA synthesis. These findings suggest that RAD52 and POLQ may be emerging targets for synthetic lethality approaches to sensitize cancer cells to genotoxic stress.
The paper explores the role of the pelo protein in Dengue virus (DENV) infection and how Wolbachia infection affects it. The authors find that Wolbachia infection suppresses the levels of the pelo protein, which in turn may contribute to restricting DENV replication. They find that DENV infection does not significantly change the levels of the pelo protein in cells, but silencing the gene in mosquitoes results in a reduction in DENV titers, suggesting that the protein plays a role in DENV production/secretion. They also find that Wolbachia-mediated suppression of the protein is specific to female mosquitoes, and that the regulation of the gene is mediated by a mosquito-specific microRNA (miRNA). The study provides new insights into the mechanism of Wolbachia-induced virus inhibition and may help inform strategies to restrict DENV transmission.
The paper describes a novel C. elegans assay system for studying C. albicans yeast-mediated pathogenesis, which complements a previous hyphal formation model used to identify novel virulence determinants in C. albicans. The authors used this system to investigate how C. elegans mounts a defense response to C. albicans yeast. They found that C. elegans exposed to C. albicans yeast cells, either heat-killed or live, mounts an immune response that involves the induction of antifungal effectors and the downregulation of antibacterial immune genes. Heat-killed C. albicans cells, like live C. albicans, can enter the nematode intestine, but are less pathogenic than wild-type yeast. The mechanism of nematode mortality during C. albicans infection is unknown. The authors propose that some aspect of fungal virulence is required for yeast to infect and kill C. elegans. They also found that the nematode downregulates a group of antibacterial genes during C. albicans infection, including CUB-like genes, C-type lectins and ShK toxins, which basally positively regulated by p38 MAP kinase. The transcriptional repression of these genes may be an adaptive response to enhance C. albicans ability to infect C. elegans. The data suggest that the nematode integrates signals from C. albicans yeast and factors associated with its pathogenicity to mount a targeted defense response. The findings have clinical implications for identifying novel antimicrobial therapies against nosocomial pathogens.
The paper presents the results of a household-based cluster study conducted in Managua, Nicaragua during the 2016 Zika epidemic to investigate Zika virus transmission in urban areas. The study found that: 61% of households had at least one Zika-positive member, with an average of 1.9 Zika-positive contacts per household (range 1-6). The majority of Zika-positive contacts (60%) had at least 50% of household members infected. Zika RNA was detected in all bodily fluids, with the highest levels in serum/plasma, similar levels in saliva and urine, and longest detection in urine. The duration of Zika RNA detection in bodily fluids ranged from 2-7 days post-symptom onset, with a maximum of 7 days in saliva and 2 days in urine. The study found that 62% of Zika infections were asymptomatic, contributing to silent transmission. The study also found that detecting Zika RNA in saliva over a similar time period and concentration as serum/plasma indicates that saliva could potentially serve as a more accessible diagnostic sample. These findings provide information about detection of viral RNA, thus informing strategies for Zika detection in bodily fluids and vector control activities. The study estimates urban Zika dissemination and percent asymptomatic infections, informing public health decision-making.
The paper discusses how the development of multicellular organisms requires the activation of functionally distinct cell types through the differential expression of gene expression. The authors investigate how transcription factors can endow cells with competence to differentiate through the activation of silent genes. They identify a cryptic FoxA target gene, Cdx2, which is transcriptionally silent in the liver but can be activated during pathological conditions like Barrett's esophagus. They find that the repressor protein Rfx1 binds to the Cdx2 enhancer and inhibits its activation by FoxA. The loss of Rfx1 expression during Barrett's esophagus progression may serve as a useful marker for cancer progression, as only a small fraction of Barrett's esophageal adenocarcinoma retain Rfx1 expression. The authors propose that FoxA occupancy of silent genes in differentiated tissues can endow competence for aberrant gene activation and may contribute to disease. The study highlights the potential of investigating factor occupancy at silent genes to reveal regulatory networks and novel genetic programming that can contribute to disease.
This paper investigates the role of phosphorylation in regulating the function of the viral pre-initiation complex (vPIC) in the transcription of late genes in herpesviruses. The vPIC is a complex that regulates the expression of genes encoding structural proteins in the viral capsid. The authors find that the protein BGLF3 is phosphorylated at threonine 42 during the lytic phase of infection and that this phosphorylation is essential for its function in transcribing late genes. They show that lack of phosphorylation of BGL3 at threonine 42 abolishes the expression of late structural proteins and reduces the ability of the virus to produce new virus particles. They propose that phosphorylation of BGL3 at threonine 42 mediates the interaction between BGL3 and the late gene regulators BFR2 and BVLF1, forming a trimeric complex that is essential for transcribing late genes. Increasing the concentration of BFR2 and BVLF1 can partially restore the function of the phosphorylation-deficient BGL3 mutant. The study suggests that phosphorylation plays an important role in regulating the assembly and function of the vPIC during the transcription of late genes, serving as a checkpoint to ensure the precise timing of assembly of subcomplexes. Identifying additional post-translational modifications that are indispensable for expression of late genes could inform the development of new drugs against herpesvirus and its associated diseases.
The paper evaluates the potential impact of different dietary policies on cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality and socioeconomic disparities in the US population. The authors use empirical estimates of policy effects and dietary intake data from nationally representative surveys to model the impact of policies targeting fruit and vegetable (F&V) consumption and sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) reduction. They find that a 10% F&V subsidy for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) participants would be the most effective policy in reducing CVD mortality and disparities, with 150,50 deaths averted by 2030. A  compared to 25,80 deaths averted by the 10% F&V subsidy for the entire population. The 30% F&V subsidy targeted to SNAP participants would be most effective at reducing CVD disparities. Combining a 10% F&V subsidy with a media campaign would be the most powerful approach, avertig 12,80 deaths. The paper suggests that a system-wide approach to price strategies targeting F&Vs and SSBs within SNAP could be particularly effective in improving diet quality and reducing CVD mortality disparities. While the individual policies have varying effectiveness, a combination of policies could potentially generate the largest benefits. The paper highlights the importance of considering structural policies that target dietary environments and behaviors within government programs to improve dietary quality and reduce health disparities.
The paper explores the barriers and motivations for consistent shoe use among a rural community in Ethiopia where podoconis is prevalent. Despite a desire to wear shoes, many practical and social barriers prevent this, including financial constraints, poor access to appropriate shoes, low perception of disease risk, difficulty finding large sizes, and fear of stigma. The study shows that patients who received podoconis treatment were more likely to wear shoes regularly, and perceived shoes as a means of protection. However, shoes were often not worn consistently for farming, housework or play. The authors suggest that any interventions to distribute shoes for other neglected tropical diseases must address the financial and social barriers that prevent consistent use and consider the specific activities and local footwear needs. Custom-made shoes may increase stigma and must be designed to minimize this. The study highlights the importance of understanding the complexities of footwear use in rural settings to develop effective interventions.
This paper uses Bayesian hierarchical modeling to analyze passive surveillance data from a rabies diagnostic laboratory to explore the spatial and temporal patterns of rabies infection among striped skunks in the North Central US. The study found that the presence of developed, low intensity areas and fragmented landscapes within 4 km2 cells was associated with a higher risk of rabies infection among striped skunks, while decreasing diurnal temperature range was associated with an increased risk of enzootic rabies. The authors suggest that highly fragmented landscapes near urban and agricultural areas may pose a significant risk of rabies transmission to humans and domestic animals. The findings highlight the need for prospective studies to assess the dynamics of striped skunk rabies prevalence and spread in the region, particularly as climate change is expected to impact the disease ecology of striped skunks. The study provides important eco-climatic drivers of striped skunk rabies that are not currently available in the literature, but cautions that the findings are only applicable to a subpopulation of striped skunks and carefully designed prospective studies are needed to fully alleviate population and spatial biases.
This paper investigated the role of parent-of-origin effects in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) disease model in rats. The authors used a backcross strategy to identify genetic loci that were transmitted from mothers to offspring and found that 37-54% of the genetic variants that predisposed for EAE were dependent on the parental origin. They found that parentally expressed genes were more likely to confer disease susceptibility, while paternally expressed genes were protective. They identified a gene, Dlk1, that was found to be imprinted and had a parent-of-origin effect on EAE susceptibility. Dlk1 expression was lower in offspring that inherited the risk allele from their mothers, which led to less severe EAE. The authors suggest that lower Dlk1 expression may fail to appropriately control Notch signaling, leading to more severe disease. The study highlights the importance of considering parent-of-origin effects in genetic studies of complex diseases, as incorporating this information can identify more powerful risk factors and provide a better understanding of disease pathogenesis.
This paper describes a study on how bacteria use protein secretion systems to deploy toxic proteins to harm other bacteria. The authors investigate the T6SS, a protein secretion system that delivers toxic proteins directly into target cells. They find that the T6SS is regulated by two different post-translational mechanisms: the TagF protein and the TPP pathway. The TPP pathway requires phosphorylation of the Fha protein to activate the T6SS, while TagF inhibits the activity. The TPP pathway is used by both offensive and defensive T6SSs. The authors show that the TPP pathway and TagF regulate T6SS assembly and activity in a conserved manner, allowing T6SSs to reorient between firing events. They also identify a new regulator, RtkS, which positively regulates the TPP pathway. Loss of RtkS has a negative impact on T6SS activity, while overexpression of RtkS has a positive effect. The study provides a comprehensive model for how T6SSs are regulated at the single cell level and how T6SSs are used as weapons for interbacterial competition.
The paper investigates collective motion in the glass prawn species Paratya australiensis. The authors conducted experiments to observe the prawns' movements and infer the rules of interaction between them based on their fine-scale movements. They used Bayesian model selection to compare models and determine the best model that could reproduce both the fine-scale interactions and the global patterns of collective motion. They found that non-Markovian models with a persistent "memory effect" that took into account the prawns' past interactions performed best, indicating that local interactions are important. The authors argue that considering non-Markovian effects is important when the behavioral changes of an individual are discontinuous and influenced by long response times or rapid movements of other animals. The results suggest that models that can reproduce both the local and global properties of collective motion may provide a more accurate understanding of the interactions between individuals in a group.
The paper investigates how the hippocampus encodes spatial navigation and reward location. The authors found that hippocampal place cells accumulate in locations that are consistently rewarding, which reflects the animal's preferred navigation behavior. The authors show that the spatial distribution of place fields in the hippocampus reflects the degree of place preference. They found that dopaminergic signals from the ventral tegmental area regulate the place field plasticity, with dopamine stimulation of the hippocampal place cells resulting in place field remapping. The study demonstrates that place cells do not simply encode spatial geometry but encode the location of prospective reward and that the spatial distribution of place fields encodes the animal's navigation behavior. The findings support the idea that the hippocampus is not just a passive mapping system but is actively involved in encoding reward location.
The paper discusses how the gamma herpesvirus 68 virus evades the host immune response by exploiting the MAVS-IKB signaling pathway to prevent cytokine production. When gamma herpesvirus 68 infects cells, it activates the MAVS-IKB pathway, which triggers the phosphorylation and degradation of the RelA subunit of the NFKB transcription factor. This terminates NFKB activation and prevents cytokine gene transcription, effectively evading the host immune response. MAVS and IKB are necessary for gamma herpesvirus 68 to activate the MAVS-IKB pathway and degrade RelA. The phosphorylation of RelA at the Ser468 site is the key step in this process. Gamma herpesvirus 68 infection also induces RelA degradation in an IKBα-independent manner, suggesting that IKBα is not essential for RelA degradation. The study shows that elevated cytokine production in response to gamma herpesvirus 68 infection is transient, suggesting that additional mechanisms may be involved. The paper argues that gamma herpesvirus 68 has evolved a "one stone, two birds" strategy to harness the host immune activation through coupling viral transcription and cellular NFKB termination to the MAVS-IKB pathway, enabling viral replication while disabling host cytokine production.
The paper describes the discovery of a new gene called Hormad1 (also called Nohma) that is specifically expressed in germ cells and plays a critical role in meiosis. The authors identified the Hormad1 gene as a mammalian homologue of the yeast Hop1 protein, which is involved in meiosis. They showed that Hormad1 is essential for proper synaptonemal complex formation and meiotic recombination in germ cells. Hormad1 mutant mice are infertile, and their testes show disruptions in synapsis, chromosome segregation, and early embryogenesis. The authors observed that Hormad1 is also required for proper spindle formation and sex body formation during meiosis. Hormad1 deficiency causes a male meiotic arrest at the pachytene stage, similar to other genes involved in synaptonemal complex and recombination. Hormad1 is also involved in early recombination events and is required for proper localization of synaptonemal complex proteins. The authors also showed that Hormad1 is upstream of ATM and ATR, and is involved in the recruitment of BRCA1, ATR and γH2AX to the sex chromosome. The gene expression of X-linked genes is significantly upregulated in Hormad1-deficient testes, indicating that Hormad is involved in meiotic sex chromosome inactivation. The paper concludes that Hormad is an essential component of the synaptonemal complex and plays a key role in meiosis and transcriptional repression.
The paper discusses how public health agencies can use next generation data sources like social media and internet data to detect emerging disease outbreaks earlier and more accurately. The authors find that while targeting the most connected individuals in a network can provide the earliest warning, this approach is sensitive to the reproduction number (R0) of the disease, which is difficult to estimate in practice. They propose a mean field model that shows the most connected individuals will provide the earliest warning when R0 is unknown. However, the timing of the early warning is highly dependent on R0. In practice, targeting individuals with the highest eigenvector centrality, which measures a node's connectivity and the connectivity of its neighbors, is the optimal approach but requires full knowledge of the network. Even if connected individuals are monitored, interpreting the signal correctly requires some knowledge of R0. The authors conclude that targeting random acquaintances of random individuals, which are biased towards highly connected nodes, can provide a practical and robust approach that balances risk and representativeness. This strategy can be applied without knowledge of the underlying contact network, especially in homogeneous networks. The authors suggest that volunteer-based surveillance systems like FluNearYou could potentially improve coverage by recruiting friends of existing members and network analysis can help identify individual-level epidemiological risk to extend surveillance systems.
The paper describes a computational method to determine the relative contributions of two negative feedback processes to the generation of relaxation oscillations in biological systems, specifically in excitatory neural networks. The method involves using a mean field model of an excitatory network regulated by two types of negative feedback: divisive (synaptic depression) and subtractive (cellular adaptation). The authors show that the divisive feedback has little effect during the silent phase, while the subtractive feedback controls the termination of the silent phase. The correlative approach, which compares the time course of each process scaled by its strength or conductance, fails to distinguish between the active and silent phases. The blockade approach, which removes one process, provides information on the relative contributions of the two processes but suffers from the loss of periodic activity. The authors develop a new measure based on geometry, where the relative contributions of the two processes are compared by comparing the distance traveled by the trajectory controlled by each process during the active and silent phases. The measure shows that the divisive feedback contributes more to the active phase termination and less to the silent phase initiation, while the subtractive feedback has the opposite trend. The method demonstrates that the contributions of the two processes are different for the active and silent phases, and the divisive feedback controls the silent phase termination. The paper concludes by discussing how the method could be applied to biological systems and other oscillatory systems.
The paper uses molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the stability of dimers formed by parallel-stranded guanine-quadruplexes (G4) structures. The authors find that G4 dimers are predominantly formed by direct aggregation of the 5' end G-tetrads, which results in a 5-5 stacking mode that is 4-5 kcal/mol more stable than the other dimeric modes. They show that this stability arises from a locally optimal arrangement of the backbones with the largest inter-phosphate distances across the interface, weakest electrostatic repulsion between the monomers. They also find that a higher stability of the 3-5 mode can be attributed to stronger counterion binding at the specific phosphate binding sites at the interface. The simulations suggest that doubling the concentration of K+ counterions can significantly increase the population of the 3-5 dimer, which is especially suited to bind cations from aqueous solution. Additionally, reducing interphosphate repulsion can enhance the stability of the G-mediated dimers. The study provides a molecular-level understanding of G4 dimer formation and provides new opportunities for designing oligomeric G4 structures.
The paper explores how the brain encodes and processes acoustic information. The authors use information theory to quantify the entropy of acoustic signals, which reflects the predictability or redundancy of the signal. They find that the primary auditory cortex (Heschl's Gyrus) does not show a relationship between entropy and neural activity during acoustic encoding, while the auditory association cortex (Planum Temporale) does. This suggests that the primary auditory cortex uses an efficient encoding mechanism that demands less computational resources for low entropy signals, while the association cortex uses a more resource-intensive mechanism for high entropy signals. The authors propose that the primary auditory cortex acts as a "computational hub" that compresses the neural code corresponding to the initial acoustic signal using sparse or predictive coding, while the association cortex uses a more symbolic and semantic representation. This allows the association cortex to perform categorical and semantic processing. The findings provide evidence for the idea that different brain areas have different encoding mechanisms that are specialized for different types of stimulus representation and processing.
The paper proposes a framework called PUMA (Penalized Unified Multiple-locus Association) analysis to detect weak associations in genome-wide association studies. It aims to identify genetic variants that are too weak to be detected by single marker tests but are associated with disease phenotypes. PUMA uses a penalized regression framework that simultaneously considers multiple genetic markers and models the polygenic architecture of complex diseases. The framework includes a new minorize-maximization algorithm for generalized linear models, data-adaptive tuning of tuning parameters, and heuristics for model selection and p-value assignment. The authors implemented several penalties for penalized regression methods that have not been applied to genome-wide association studies before. They applied PUMA to simulate large genome-wide association studies and compared the performance to existing methods. PUMA identified many more weak associations that were not detected by single marker tests, including associations that replicated known associations from independent studies. The framework was able to identify novel associations with known biological links to the disease etiology. The authors conclude that PUMA has the potential to add significant value to genome-wide association studies by identifying additional disease associations that are not detectable by single marker methods.
The paper investigates the role of SPCLIP1 in the mosquito complement pathway during malaria infection. It is found that SPCLIP1, a non-catalytic CLIP-domain serine protease, localizes to the surface of malaria ookinetes and promotes rapid accumulation of the complement protein TEP1. SPCLIP1 is required for TEP1 convertase activity, which is triggered by binding of TEP1cut circulating in the hemolymph in complex with the LRIM1/APL1C complex. The TEP1 convertase recruits additional C3 and TEP1 precursors to the microbial surface, leading to melanization. The study shows that SPCLIP1 regulates TEP1 convertase activity by interacting with TEP1cut and recruiting it to microbial surfaces, and that the mechanism of TEP1 convertase formation is different from the vertebrate C3 convertase. The results suggest that the mosquito complement pathway has evolved independently from vertebrate complement, with different triggers of activity. The findings provide novel insights into the mechanisms regulating the mosquito complement pathway and its role in defense against malaria.
The paper proposes a new optimization algorithm called OptMDFpathway to identify thermodynamically feasible pathways in genome-scale metabolic networks that allow for carbon fixation. The algorithm uses a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) approach to maximize the Max-min Driving Force (MDF) value for a given phenotype while ensuring that the reactions that are active in the solution are thermodynamically feasible. The authors apply this algorithm to the E. coli genome-scale model and core model to identify pathways that allow for carbon fixation from glycerol and glucose substrates. They find that 15% of cytosolic metabolites in E. coli can be synthesized with carbon fixation from the considered substrates, with 40% of substrate-product combinations being thermodynamically feasible. The identified pathways require only 13-17 enzyme-catalyzed reactions, making them potentially viable for cell-free applications. They propose the synthesis of oxaloacetate from glycerol and carbamoyl phosphate as promising candidates for carbon fixation with high yields. The authors conclude that the OptMDFpathway algorithm can be used to identify thermodynamically feasible pathways that allow for carbon fixation in genome-scale metabolic networks, which could potentially be used for sustainable biotechnological applications.
The paper describes the crystal structure of the chaperone protein CfaA from the Class 5 fimbria of Escherichia coli, which is part of the alternate chaperone pathway for pilus assembly. The authors used structure-based sequence alignment to show that CfaA is distinct from both the FGL and FGS chaperone families. They introduced mutations into CfaA to test its function in subunit binding and pilus assembly and found that CfaA uses a different anchoring residue (R154) than FGL and FGS chaperones. The unique features of CfaA's subunit-interacting loop and insertions were found to be important for its function. The mutations revealed that CfaA interacts with both the minor and major subunits differently, suggesting that it recognizes them through different mechanisms. The study proposes that CfaA and other Class 5 chaperones be classified as FGA (F1-G1) chaperones.
The paper describes a conditional mouse model of Scribble loss in the mammary gland to study its role in mammary duct morphogenesis and tumorigenesis. The authors generated conditional floxed alleles of Scrib in mice and crossed them to a Cre mouse to delete Scrib in the mammary gland. They found that loss of Scrible led to hyperplasia and disruption of tissue polarity in the mammary ducts, resulting in premalignant lesions with increased cell proliferation and altered cell divisions. They showed that Scrible is required for the control of spindle orientation during mammary duct morphogenesis and for the proper maturation of luminal cells. Loss of Scrible led to hyperactivation of the Ras/MAPK pathway, which in turn promoted the accumulation of aberrant luminal cells and the development of premalignant lesions. Their results suggest that disruption of tissue polarity and activation of oncogenic signaling pathways may play key roles in the early stages of breast cancer development and progression. The study highlights the importance of studying cell polarity genes in vivo using mouse models to better understand their role in mammary morphogenesis and tumorigenesis.
The paper describes the transcriptome of the salivary glands of the blood-sucking bug Rhodnius neglectus, which feeds on birds and less frequently on rodents. The researchers used RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry to identify and analyze the transcripts and proteins in the salivary glands. They found that the salivary transcripts encode a large number of lipocalins, nitrophorins, antigen-5 and serine proteases, which are known to play roles in blood-feeding. However, only one serine protease was identified through mass spectrometry, despite many transcripts indicating its presence. The lipocalins and nitrophorins were found to be abundant and were classified into subfamilies. The study suggests that the low number of identified serine proteases may be due to low expression, non-secretion or expression only under certain conditions. The proteins are conserved across Rhodnius species, indicating they evolved independently and have different molecular mechanisms. The findings suggest that different triatomine species have adapted different strategies to achieve successful blood meals. Further studies on the role of the identified proteins in blood-feeding and transmission of Chagas disease are needed.
The paper investigated the effects of Trichuris suis infection on the mucosal immune response in juvenile rhesus macaques with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The study found that Trichuris infection led to a TH2-type immune response in the intestinal mucosa of IBD subjects, which was associated with symptomatic improvement. The treatment was found to reduce cellular markers of mucosal inflammation, such as Ki67+ T cells, while Treg expansion was noted under conditions of mucosal inflammation and was reduced by Trichuris treatment. The data suggest that Trichuris promotes mucosal healing in the setting of IBD by activating mucus production and epithelial cell turnover aspects of TH2-type immunity, which reduces the attachment of immunostimulatory bacteria to the colonic epithelium and restores diversity to the mucosal microbiota. However, the study had some limitations, including the lack of a control arm and the absence of chronic infection. The results suggest that Trichuris treatment may be more dependent on a TH2 response than immunoregulation. The study highlights the potential of using juvenile rhesus macaques with ICD as a preclinical model for IBD research, given the similarities between their mucosal gene expression profiles and those of human UC patients. However, the distinct differences between the macaque immune system and human immune system limit the usefulness of this model for certain IBD research.
The paper describes a cross-sectional study of Strongyloides stercoralis infection in 60 rural villages in northern Cambodia. The study found that 4.7% of participants were infected with the parasite, with children under six years old being at highest risk (5.5%). Prevalence increased with age, with most adults over 45 years being infected. The study employed multiple diagnostic techniques (KAP culture and Baermann method) to determine infection, finding that KAP culture was more sensitive than Baermann. The study found that rainfall, soil organic carbon content and cropland were associated with lower infection risk. However, no spatial correlation was observed. The study found that 39% of infections could be prevented by proper hygiene practices, suggesting that environmental factors play a role in transmission. The findings suggest that the high prevalence of in Cambodia is likely due to inadequate diagnostic methods and environmental factors. The study highlights the need for further research to better understand the epidemiology of Strongyloides stercoralis and improve sanitation practices to prevent infections.
This paper proposes a molecular dynamics simulation model for the formation of amyloid fibrils from amyloid beta peptides. The authors focus on the asymmetric quiescent fibrils that have been observed in experiments, which have two sets of chemical shifts for certain 13C-labeled sites. They propose that these fibrils consist of three cross-β subunits arranged in a 2-fold symmetry, with one cross-β subunit arranged laterally and the other cross-β subunit arranged in a triangular configuration. They use molecular dynamics simulations to model the assembly of the core cross-β subunit building block and then stacking simulations to model the asymmetric quiescent fibrils. They find that the cross-β subunits with aHH and aPP interfaces are the most stable interfaces and that the 3 cross-β subunits are arranged in 6 tightly stacked β-sheet layers. The model is consistent with experimental constraints and explains how external perturbations like mechanical shaking or chemical oxidation can affect fibrillar formation. The authors suggest that the exposed hydrophobic surface of the asymmetric quiescent fibrils may be more toxic compared to the agitated fibrils, and propose that detergent-like ligands could bind to the hydrophobic surface and expose the hydrophilic part to improve solubility.
The paper discusses the role of caspase-1 in Burkholderia pseudomallei infection and melioidosis. The authors generated caspase-1-deficient mice and found that caspase-1 is required for the survival of mice infected with B. pseudomallei. Caspase-1 deficiency led to increased susceptibility to B. pseudomallei infection and higher bacterial burdens in organs. Caspase-1 was also found to be required for pyroptosis in lung epithelial cells, which restricted intracellular bacterial replication. The authors conclude that the main protective mechanism of caspase-1 during melioidosis is through pyroptosis in epithelial cells, while pyroptosis in myeloid cells is a secondary effect. The paper also shows that the protective effect of interferon gamma is mediated by ROS production through the NADPH oxidase pathway, not caspase-1. The authors propose that the high susceptibility of caspase-1-deficient mice to melioidosis is likely due to their inability to produce IL-18, which is required for the protective effect of caspase-1. Overall, the paper highlights the importance of caspase-1 in controlling pyroptosis and the non-canonical inflammasome in the host response to B. pseudomallei infection.
The paper describes a randomized controlled trial in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania to evaluate the effectiveness and feasibility of community delivery of antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) by lay health workers to HIV positive patients who are clinically stable on ART. The community delivery model aimed to reduce the burden on health facilities and improve patient retention. The study found that the community delivery model performed at least as well as standard facility-based ART in terms of virological failure, with 89% of patients failing virologically at study exit compared to 97% in the control arm. However, only 48% of patients in the intervention arm received ARVs at home, and the sample size was not large enough to establish conclusively that community delivery was non-inferior to standard care. The study suffered from implementation challenges such as difficulties in linking participants across datasets, low return rates for the study exit assessment, and eligibility criteria limiting enrollment to only patients living within the catchment area of the health facility. The study concludes that while community ARV delivery holds promise as an alternative to standard care, more research is needed to scale it up and address issues of dilution bias, patient retention and cost savings.
This paper describes a study on how the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans is able to withstand fluctuating food availability. The authors found that the nematode is able to gauge changes in food availability through sensory neurons and release of dense-core vesicles containing neuropeptides. The dense-core vesicles are released from sensory neurons and contain insulin-like peptides that signal through the DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor, which regulates cellular processes such as growth and reproduction. The study identified a specific channel, OCR-2, that is localized to sensory cilia and releases dense-core vesicles in response to nutrient availability. The authors propose that the neural assessment of nutrient availability directly coordinates growth and starvation survival pathways through release of insulin-like peptides. The study suggests that the specific molecular mechanisms through which sensory neurons detect changes in food availability are still to be deciphered, but OCR-2 is likely to be a key sensor of nutritional conditions that modulates insulin signaling. The findings suggest that sensory perception and insulin signaling coordinate starvation survival and adult lifespan. The study also suggests that insulin signaling mediates some of the effects of TRPV channel activation on neural information storage and adaptation to external cues. The results provide insights into the molecular mechanisms that determine starvation survival and lifespan in C. elegans and may have implications for understanding mammalian insulin secretion and lifespan.
This paper identifies and characterizes a new Toll receptor, Toll4, which is a key factor in sensing White Spotted Syndrome Virus (WSSV) infection in the shrimp Litopenae vannamei. The authors cloned and identified nine Toll genes from L. vannamei, including Toll1 to Toll9, and found that Toll4 is specifically involved in recognizing WSSV infection and mediating the antiviral response. Toll4 induces the expression of a specific set of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) that can bind to WSSV structural proteins, including lysozyme and antifungal factors. This results in reduced viral titers and increased mortality in shrimp silenced for Toll4. The authors propose a Toll4-Dorsal-AMP pathway is involved in the antiviral immune response in L. vannamei, where Toll4 recognizes WSSV infection, activates Dorsal, and induces the expression of specific AMPs that bind to WSSV structural proteins. The study provides insights into the antiviral mechanisms of the Toll pathway in shrimp and may provide strategies for controlling WSSV infection in shrimp aquaculture.
The paper describes the discovery of a new function of the protein Rrm3 in DNA replication. Rrm3 is a protein that is known to help facilitate DNA replication by preventing protein-DNA complexes and acting as a checkpoint that helps ensure proper DNA synthesis during replication. The authors found that Rrm3 has a novel function in controlling DNA replication in the presence of DNA damage, which is distinct from its established role in facilitating replication fork progression. They found that when Rrm3 is missing, cells are unable to replicate properly and accumulate DNA lesions that activate the DNA damage checkpoint. This leads to increased mutations. They identified two functions of Rrm3: an ATPase/helicase-dependent function that helps prevent protein-DNA complexes and an N-terminal tail-dependent function that restricts DNA synthesis in the presence of DNA damage. The N-terminal tail is required for binding Orc5, an ATP-binding subunit of the origin recognition complex, and acts as a replication checkpoint. The N-terminal tail function is distinct from Rrm3's ATPase/helicase activity and does not require Rad5, Rad1 or Mph1, suggesting that it is a new function of Rrm3. The authors propose a model where Rrm3 has two genetically and physically separable functions: one to facilitate replication fork progression and another to act as a checkpoint in the presence of DNA damage. The N-terminal tail function helps restrict DNA synthesis in the presence of DNA damage, while the ATPase/helicase activity helps prevent protein-DNA complexes. The findings suggest that the types of DNA lesions that accumulate when Rrm3's ATPase/helicase activity is inactivated are different from those that accumulate when its N-terminal tail function is lost.
The paper investigates the relationship between age-related DNA methylation changes and cancer prognosis. The authors analyze DNA methylation data from 25 different types of cancer and find that age-related hypermethylated CpGs are associated with better prognosis, while age-related hypomethylated CpGs are associated with worse prognosis. They find that this association is particularly observed in cancers where the DNAm patterns are coherently modified within the cancer cells, rather than reflecting the chronological age of the patient. They propose that age-related DNAm changes may act as a barrier to prevent cancer initiation in aging cells, but also favor changes in chromosomal organization that lead to mutations. The authors suggest that modification of age-related DNAm patterns in tumor-initiating cells may be one of the multiple "hits" required for cancer development in the elderly. Overall, the results suggest that age-related DNAm changes may play a role in cancer development and prognosis, but the exact mechanisms are still unclear.
This paper describes the identification and characterization of a novel carbon dioxide sensing pathway in the fungus Candida albicans. The authors used a genetic screen to identify a bZIP transcription factor, Rca1p, which regulates the expression of a carbonic anhydrase enzyme required for fungal metabolism in response to low ambient CO2 levels. They found that Rca1p functions independently of the known CO2 sensor adenylyl cyclase and cAMP signaling pathway and regulates the expression of carbonic anhydrase in both Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The authors used a high-resolution two-photon excitation confocal microscopy technique to visualize the distribution of CO2 inside yeast colonies and show that cells in the outer layers of the colony express high levels of the carbonic anhydrase protein in ambient air, while cells in the center of the colony do not. They also found that inactivation of Rca1p leads to a growth defect in Candida albicans, suggesting that it plays an important role in cellular metabolism. The paper highlights the importance of the Rca1p transcription factor in regulating the expression of the carbonic anhydrase enzyme in response to CO2 levels and suggests that this pathway may be involved in fungal pathogenesis and drug resistance.
The paper discusses the results of a study on visceral leishmaniasis (VL) patients in Brazil. The study found that visceral leishmaniasis patients have elevated levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in their plasma, which is a marker of immune activation. The authors suggest that LPS may contribute to the immune activation and systemic inflammation observed in VL patients, which can lead to further immune suppression and disease progression. They found that LPS levels were negatively correlated with absolute CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts, indicating that higher LPS levels were associated with lower T cell counts. They also found that LPS was positively correlated with the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like MIF, which can further enhance the immune activation. The authors propose that LPS may be a useful biomarker for assessing VL prognosis and that reducing LPS levels through antimicrobial prophylaxis may be a beneficial strategy for VL patients.
The paper investigates the difference in spontaneous mutation rates between Escherichia coli grown aerobically and anaerobically. The study finds that the mutation rate of E. coli grown anaerobically is 1.7-fold higher than that of E. coli grown aerobically, consistent with previous studies. The paper identifies several factors that may contribute to this difference, including higher IS element activity, particularly IS150, which mediates insertions, and mutations in the terminus region. The study shows that mutation rates are significantly higher when calculated per unit time rather than generation, indicating that mutations occur independently of cell cycle phase. The study also finds that acid stress and depurination may contribute to the higher mutation rate in anaerobic conditions. The study provides insights into the genetic elements that predominantly contribute to spontaneous insertions and mutations, their genomic distribution and impact on genome organization. Overall, the study provides new insights into the mutagenic and physiological pressures associated with aerobic and anaerobic growth, and provides a framework for understanding the evolution of facultative anaerobes.
The paper proposes a method called QCM (Quasi-Clique Merger) to identify frequent co-expression gene networks from large-scale gene expression datasets from multiple types of cancer and normal tissues. The QCM algorithm uses gene-pair correlation as weights to identify dense sub-networks that are highly correlated across multiple datasets. The authors apply QCM to identify co-expression networks from cancer and normal tissue datasets and find that the cancer networks are enriched for genes involved in cell cycle regulation, genome stability, DNA repair, and cancer-specific processes, while the normal networks are enriched for housekeeping functions like cell respiration and protein synthesis. The cancer networks show higher GO term enrichment and prognostic power for cancer patients, indicating that they are more functionally related to cancer. The authors identify several novel genes that participate in genome stability, centrosome duplication and DNA repair and are potential oncogenes. The study demonstrates that frequent co-expression network mining can be a powerful tool to identify functional gene clusters and oncogenes related to cancer cell activities. However, the method has limitations in that it only captures transcriptional gene expression and cannot capture post-transcriptional interactions.
The paper describes a machine learning approach to predict the interactions between bZIP proteins and design peptides that specifically bind to them. The authors used a dataset of experimental interactions between bZIP proteins and peptides to train a machine learning model that predicts the stability of bZIP dimers and interactions between bZIP residues. They found that their model was significantly more accurate than existing prediction methods, and was able to design peptides that selectively bound to specific bZIP targets with high affinity and specificity. They used this approach to design peptides that specifically bound to four bZIP targets, XBP1, JUN, ATF4 and ATF5, demonstrating that the model has utility for engineering peptides that interact with bZIP proteins. The approach involved using a heptad library of 1,303 heptads from known bZIP proteins to assemble new peptides, and applying constraints to the optimization problem to ensure that the resulting peptides had the desired composition and interactions. The peptides were synthesized and tested using fluorescence resonance energy transfer and competition assays, showing that they bound the targets with high affinity and specificity. The approach demonstrates that combining experimental data with computational learning techniques can be useful for engineering peptides that interact with protein-protein interactions, and has potential applications in systems biology and materials science.
This paper examines how rats make free choices in a stable, deterministic environment where they receive the same reward for each option. The researchers found that the rats' choices exhibit bimodal inter-choice interval distributions with a power-law for short choices and a Weibull distribution for long choices. They propose a dual-state model consisting of an active and inactive state, where the active state has bursty behavior influenced by a circadian rhythm, and the inactive state has a non-homogeneous Poisson process. The active state has a satiation-attainment process that waits for satiety feedback before choosing again. The inactive state has an inactivity rate influenced by the circadian rhythm. The model accounts for two key sequential features: persistence of choices and a bias in favor of the highest-ranked option. The model shows that even in a stable environment, rats can exhibit rich temporal and sequential dynamics, and that the interaction of different underlying mechanisms can generate dynamic choice patterns. The dual-control model consisting of goal-directed and habitual control cooperates to make choices that are reliable and based on individual value.
The paper examines the evolution of thermostability in the ribonuclease H enzyme family, specifically looking at the differences between thermophilic and mesophilic homologs. The authors find that while thermostability (Tm) of the proteins generally increases along the thermophilic lineage, the mechanisms by which it is achieved vary between individual proteins. They trace the evolution of thermostability along the two lineages using ancestral sequence reconstruction and find that changes in thermodynamic parameters, such as enthalpy, entropy, and heat capacity, that determine stability fluctuate over evolutionary time. They conclude that the evolution of thermostability is an example of "thermodynamic systems drift," where the threshold stability is maintained but the mechanisms of stability change. This suggests that studying individual proteins or lineages to infer long-term temperature trends may not provide accurate information on global temperature changes over time. The study highlights the importance of considering mechanistic differences between homologs when studying thermostability and provides insights for engineering stable proteins.
This paper presents a mathematical modeling approach to investigate the role of dendritic cells in protecting against cytopathic viral infections. The authors used a systems biology approach to model the early dynamics of interferon alpha production and virus growth in response to mouse hepatitis virus infection. They decomposed the system into elementary modules representing virus replication, target cell turnover, interferon alpha production, and virus-cell interactions. They calibrated these modules using in vitro data and then integrated them into a closed system model of pDC-mediated type I interferon responses in vivo. They found that the spleen represents a robust sink for cytopathic virus infection, able to cope with substantial variations in virus production, but the system is very fragile to minor increases in virus growth in peripheral tissues. They identified the minimal protective unit of pre-activated pDCs in the spleen to be around 200 cells, which can rescue the host from severe disease. The results suggest that maintaining the sink function of spleen is one of the major functions of pDCs. The model suggests that antiviral compounds should target viral spread within non-lymphoid target organs, since pDC-derived interferon alpha within splenic organs secure efficient protection of vulnerable target cells.
The paper describes the results of a genome-wide association study (GWAS) aimed at identifying genes associated with impaired acrosome reaction in stallions. The study found that a susceptibility locus for the condition was located on chromosome 13, specifically within a 3.9 Mb region that contained 105 protein coding genes, 4 RNA genes, and 6 pseudogenes. The most strongly associated SNP was found to be on exon 4 of the FKBP6 gene, which codes for a protein involved in acrosome reaction. The study showed that cases were more related to each other than controls, indicating that the genotype was inherited. The FKBP6 gene was found to be monoallelically expressed and showed association with the IAR phenotype, suggesting that the polymorphism may affect transcription or protein function. The study suggests that FKBP6 is a susceptibility gene for impaired acrosome reaction in stallions, although the exact mechanism remains unclear.
The paper proposes a motion detection model based on the known biological motion detectors in insects, specifically the lobula plate cells (LPTCs) in flies. The model is designed to overcome the limitations of correlation-based motion detectors, which are inherent in the biological system, by adding nonlinear components to provide a robust estimate of global motion. The model is shown to achieve accurate and robust detection of angular velocity across a wide range of spatial sample rates, even for low contrast images. The key advantage of the model is its ability to provide a constant response to different images, which is important for real-time applications. The model is shown to be effective even under dynamic conditions, where the biological system would not have sufficient time to reach steady state. The model is based on parameters derived from physiological studies of flies, but is likely applicable to other species. The model is proposed as a candidate for real-time implementation in parallel hardware for computer vision applications.
The paper discusses the results of a cross-sectional study in a rural Nigerian community on the risk factors associated with tungiasis, a neglected tropical disease caused by the bite of the sand flea Tunga penetrans. The study found that several modifiable factors are associated with tungias infestation in the community, including living in houses made of sand or clay, resting outside, lack of knowledge on transmission, lack of use of closed footwear, and presence of pigs on the compound. The type of house was not an independent risk factor but was confounded by other factors such as type of floor. Sandy floors and outdoor resting places were the most important risk factors. The use of insecticides indoors and soap were protective factors. The study found that cementing floors, confining pigs to pigpens and explaining breeding sites were effective intervention measures to reduce tungias prevalence by almost 75%. The authors argue that a combination of interventions targeting animal reservoirs, housing and health education is needed to effectively reduce the burden of tungias.
The paper proposes a model of how the hippocampus forms a neural representation of the local environment using a dual rate and position code. The model suggests that the hippocampal place cells form a spatial attractor for each location in the environment, which can be remapped to a new context through recurrent connections. The model shows that the gradual population transitions observed in rate remapping experiments can be explained by the presence of local attractors for contextual features embedded in a spatial attractor manifold. The discrete attractors for contextual features within the spatial attractor can transition at different points during the remapping process, resulting in gradual population transitions. The model also shows that the spatial stability of the network is important for the ability to remap between contexts. The paper predicts that attractor dynamics can explain the observed rate remapping behavior, which is independent of the dentate gyrus, but requires recurrent connections and synaptic plasticity. The ability to locally update the place field representation without affecting other place cells could provide flexibility for the hippocampus to adapt to changing environments. The model provides a framework for understanding how the hippocampus represents spatial information and how it impacts decision making.
The paper discusses the time-course dynamics of tissue damage and repair after injection of venom from the viper snake Bothrops asper into mouse gastrocnemius muscle. The authors used a proteomic approach to analyze the exudates collected from the muscle at different time intervals after injection (1, 6 and 24 hours) and compared them to the histological and immunochemical changes observed. They identified differences in the abundance of intracellular proteins, extracellular matrix (ECM) components and other proteins in the exudates at each time point. The proteins identified were classified into groups based on their changes in abundance between samples. The results showed that intracellular proteins were most abundant in the early stages of venom injection, indicating the rapid cytotoxic effect of venom. Cytoskeletins were more abundant at later stages, suggesting the release of cytoskeletin fragments from damaged cells. Most ECM components were found in the early stages, consistent with the rapid damage to ECM. The proteolytic activity of exudates was highest at 1 hour, indicating the action of venom-derived proteinases. However, the activity decreased over time, suggesting that endogenous MMPs generated in the inflammatory response were responsible for the later hydrolysis of ECM components. The degradation of ECM components, especially perlecan and type IV collagen, was found to be highest in early stages, consistent with the mechanism of hemoragic venom toxin-induced microvascular damage. The study provides a more complete view of the time-course dynamics of venom-induced tissue damage and repair and highlights the importance of the early action of venom-derived proteinases and later endogenous MMPs in the pathogenesis of venom-induced tissue damage.
This paper evaluates the impact of a national deworming campaign on soil-transmitted helminthic infections in Uganda. The campaign began in 2003 and has been implemented twice yearly since then, targeting school-age children and high-risk groups. The study found that there has been a significant reduction in soil-transmitted helminth prevalence and intensity over the years, with the highest reductions seen in districts that implemented mass drug administration for lymphatic filariasis. However, districts that did not have lymphatic filariasis had an increase in soil-transmitted helminth prevalence. The study also found that awareness and knowledge about soil-transmitted helminths increased among children, and majority knew what soil-transmitted helminths were and how they got infected. However, the study concludes that sanitation issues still need to be addressed to interrupt soil-transmitted helminth transmission, as the high reproductive capacity of helminths means that transmission can resume even if infection intensity is reduced without additional interventions. The paper argues that improving sanitation, hand washing facilities, and access to clean water is necessary to ensure stable provision and use of adequate facilities to end open defecation. The study suggests that a holistic approach that includes monitoring and evaluation of the program is necessary to prioritize operational research agenda and utilize resources effectively.
This paper aims to test the Bayesian confidence hypothesis that confidence ratings are based on Bayesian probability computations. The authors performed experiments where subjects performed two tasks with overlapping categories and varied the reliability of the stimuli. They fit 75 different models to the subjects' confidence ratings and found that the Bayesian models did not fit the data well, while heuristic models that approximate Bayesian computations but do not compute a posterior distribution over category performed better. The authors conclude that confidence is likely not based on Bayesian probability computations but rather heuristic computations that use sensory uncertainty to make decisions. The results suggest that the Bayesian confidence hypothesis does not describe human confidence reports particularly well. The deviations from Bayesian computation may be due to unknown principles or ecological constraints that limit the brain's ability to perform Bayesian computations, such as neural energy costs and constraints on neural wiring. The study suggests that heuristic models may provide a better understanding of the neural basis of confidence.
This paper presents a detailed study on the genome-wide variation in recombination rates in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. The authors generated high-resolution maps of recombination events using eight crosses between natural inbred strains and analyzed 5860 female meioses to detect 3251 CO events and 7453 GC events. They found that CO events are more evenly distributed across the genome, while GC events are more frequent and more evenly distributed. They detected hotspots of high CO rates and coldspots of low CO rates, and observed that GC events are more common in annotated transcriptional units. They found that CO rates are more strongly correlated with nucleotide polymorphism than GC rates, indicating that CO events are more likely to occur in regions with higher heterogeneity. They also found that a heterozygosity-dependent repair of DSBs favors GC over CO events, which could explain the observed distribution of recombination rates across the genome. The study provides a detailed picture of the different types of recombination variation in D. melanogaster, including hotspots and coldspots, and highlights the importance of obtaining estimates of recombination from multiple crosses to capture the full population dynamics. The results emphasize the need to incorporate the dynamic nature of recombination variation into population genetic models of selection and evolution.
This paper investigates the functions of three multigene families of exported proteins in the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei. The authors find that members of these families are expressed in liver stages in addition to blood stages, indicating that they may play roles beyond sequestration and rosetting of red blood cells. They identify a subset of proteins that contain a steroidogenic acute regulatory-related lipid transfer (START) domain, which is involved in lipid transfer between membranes, and demonstrate that some of these proteins have phosphatidylcholine transfer activity. They find that Fam-A proteins are the only Plasmodium encoded proteins with a START domain, which suggests they may transfer lipids from the host to the parasite. This transfer of lipids may help the parasite grow intracellularly. The authors also observe that members of the multigene families are expressed in both the cytoplasm and plasma membrane of blood stages, indicating they may not be involved in direct interactions with red blood cells. The expression of these proteins in liver stages may influence the host immune response and help the parasite grow intracellularly. The results suggest that different members of these families may fulfill different functions.
The paper discusses the genomic and evolutionary characteristics of Francisella tularensis, a bacterium that causes tularemia, a potentially deadly respiratory disease in humans. The authors analyze the genomes of 20 Francisella strains, including some newly sequenced, to understand how the different subspecies within the genus have evolved and how this has contributed to their virulence. They find that the more virulent Francisella tularensis subspecies have more genome rearrangements, pseudogenes, and other genomic features that likely contribute to their ability to infect and harm humans. In contrast, the less virulent Francisella tularensis subspecies holarctica and subspecies mediasiatica have fewer rearrangements and pseudogenes, suggesting that their genomes have undergone decay and adaptation to their respective niches. The authors propose a model of evolution where bacteria undergo genomic rearrangements and pseudogenesis as they adapt to new environments, leading to the acquisition of genes required for virulence and niche adaptation, but also genomic decay in pathogenic species. This decay may have contributed to the attenuation of virulence in the holarctica and mediasiatica subspecies. The study provides new insights into how bacteria evolve to become pathogenic and how genomic rearrangements can contribute to this process.
This paper investigates the role of viral factors in determining viral load set-points in heterosexual couples infected with HIV-1. The study uses data from a cohort of over 1000 HIV-1 infected individuals in rural Uganda. The authors find that couples with similar viral load set-points tend to have similar viral loads, suggesting that the transmitted virus plays an important role in determining viral load. They estimate that 16-37% of the variation in viral load within couples can be attributed to the similarity in viral genotypes between partners. However, they note that their study is likely an underestimate of the true role of viral factors due to the small sample size and lack of data on host genetics and immune factors. They suggest that viral factors such as the accumulation of CTL escape mutations, traits determined by viruses on mucosal surfaces and other unknown mechanisms may influence viral load set-point. The results have implications for understanding how HIV-1 virulence evolves in untreated infection and in response to public health measures. Further studies with larger samples and more detailed data are needed to confirm the findings.
This paper reports the association of a rare genetic variant in the LRP6 gene with early-onset and penetrating Crohn's disease in the small intestine. The LRP6 gene encodes a low density lipoprotein receptor, which is essential for Wnt signaling transduction and is involved in the regulation of Paneth cell function. The study found that individuals with a specific variant of the LRP6 gene (rs230285Ile1062Val) have reduced levels of two Paneth cell antimicrobial peptides (HD-5 and HD-6) in their mucosal tissue. This reduction was seen independently of other genetic variants associated with Crohn's disease, suggesting that the LRP6 variant specifically affects Paneth cell function. The study found that LRP6 expression was also reduced in ileal CD patients, which may contribute to the reduced HD-5 levels. The study suggests that impaired LRP6 function may be an additional mechanism that contributes to the reduced Paneth cell function in Crohn's disease, and provides an attractive therapeutic target. The findings provide further evidence for the importance of Paneth cells in the development of small intestinal Crohn's disease and highlight the potential role of the LRP6 gene as a diagnostic marker for early onset and penetrating disease.
This paper investigates the mechanism by which the Cucumber mosa virus (CMV) protein, a plant RNA virus, modulates its own replication and infection by controlling the activity of host RNA silencing pathways. The CMV protein contains a region rich in basic and positively charged amino acids that binds RNA. The authors found that this region, called the N-terminal R-rich region, negatively regulates the activity of a host protein called 2b that suppresses RNA silencing. When the CMV protein accumulates to high levels, it inhibits the activity of 2b, leading to increased RNA silencing and reduced viral accumulation in infected shoot apices. This results in symptom recovery from transient infection. The 2b protein is required for systemic infection of CMV. The authors propose that the CMV protein acts as a central regulator of connections between RNA silencing and virus-encoded suppressors of host defense mechanisms, enabling CMV to persistently infect shoot apices and avoid severe disease. The study reveals a novel self-attenuation mechanism by which the activity of the 2b protein is down-regulated by high levels of the CMV protein, allowing CMV to persistently infect newly emerging tissues.
This paper describes a study on the resistance mechanism of crizotinib, a drug used to treat non-small cell lung cancer, in response to a mutation in the ROS1 tyrosine kinase. The authors used molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the binding of crizotib to the wild-type and mutated ROS1 tyrosine kinase. They found that the mutation resulted in a more rigid conformation of the P-loop region, which was opened even in the bound state. This made it difficult for crizotib to bind and unbind from the active pocket, resulting in attenuated binding affinity and shorter residence time. The authors conclude that in addition to binding affinity, residence time should be considered for rational drug design to overcome drug resistance, as the shortened residence time and larger activation free energy of dissociation contributed to crizotib resistance in the mutated ROS1 tyrosine kinase.
The paper describes a new method called LoClass that can automatically classify and characterize bacterial membrane-bound organelles based on their protein composition. The authors used this method to analyze 23 bacterial genomes and identify 23 different types of bacterial membrane-bound organelles, including carboxysomes, metabolosomes, and other types. The method uses a novel approach that focuses on the protein composition of the membrane protein genes rather than the genomic context of the genes. It was able to identify novel types of bacterial membrane-bound organelles and uncover new insights into the diversity of bacterial membrane-bound organelles. The authors believe that their method can inform the design of synthetic biology applications that involve introducing genetic and metabolic modules for bacterial membrane-bound organelles. The results provide a comprehensive taxonomy of bacterial membrane-bound organelles that can guide the experimental characterization of their functions and specialization.
The paper presents a method to identify functional associations between phosphorylation sites within proteins using co-occurrence of phosphorylation status across different conditions. The authors found that co-occurrence of phosphorylation sites within the same protein or between interacting proteins can be used to identify functional associations, even when the phosphorylation sites are not proximal. They used a stringent p-value threshold to define co-occurring pairs and found that the identified co-occurring pairs tend to have higher functional annotations, catalyzed by the same kinases, and show higher conservation across species. They applied the method to human and mouse phosphorylation data and found that co-occurrence of phosphorylation status can identify functional associations between phosphorylation sites in both species. The method was able to identify several long-range functional cross-talk between phosphorylation sites, which were not detected by other methods. The authors suggest that co-occurrence analysis can be used as a complement to existing methods to identify novel functional associations between different phosphorylation types. The results provide evidence that functional associations between phosphorylation sites can be identified using co-occurrence of phosphorylation status, and the method has the potential to identify new functional associations between phosphorylation sites that are not detected by existing methods.
The paper proposes a new method to identify circadian oscillating genes in gene expression profiles by analyzing them in a continuous phase continuum rather than one gene at a time. The authors find that using this approach, they can identify many more circadian oscillating genes than traditional methods, up to 10% of genes, which is consistent with previous studies. They show that circadian oscillation is present in genes involved in basic metabolism and metabolic pathways, but not necessarily the entire genes themselves. The phase of oscillation is highly tissue-specific, but the amplitude is less specific. The method provides evidence that oscillation is a natural feature of all biological pathways and is important for understanding the timing of gene expression and interactions between genes. The authors believe that biological pathways and interaction networks should be modeled in a way similar to alternating current circuits, reflecting the phase and amplitude of their components, rather than current circuits, to better capture the complex nature of gene expression.
The paper describes the discovery of new mechanisms by which E. coli cells can tolerate overinitiation of chromosome replication, which occurs when the origin of replication initiates multiple times per cell cycle. The authors identified two types of mechanisms by which cells can suppress this overinitiation: 1) by reducing the ATP/ADP ratio through downregulation of the TCA cycle and upregulation of the micro-aerobic respiratory chain, and 2) by reducing oxidative stress through upregulation of cytochrome bd-1. They identified three mutations that can achieve this: iscU, fre, and atpA. These mutations limit DNA damage and ROS production, allowing cells to tolerate overinitiation and continue to grow. They found that cells with these mutations have a reduced ATP/ADP ratio and increased NADH/NAD+ ratio, suggesting that these mechanisms do not affect initiation frequency directly but rather maintain the balance of DnaAATP/DnaAADP. The authors propose that the iscU, fre, and atpA mutations reduce ROS production and oxidative damage to DNA, allowing cells to sustain growth of overinitiating cells. The results suggest that there are many mechanisms by which cells can maintain the balance of DnaAATP/DnaAADP and chromosome stability, beyond simply adjusting the ATP/ADP ratio.
This paper describes a study that used high-throughput functional genomics screens to identify host miRNAs that regulate henipavirus infection. The study found that four miRNA families, particularly the miR-181 family, promote henipavirus infection. miR-181 specifically enhances henipavirus entry and cell-cell fusion by down-regulating expression of class A Eph receptors that compete with henipavirus glycoproteins for binding to ephrin-B2 and ephrin-B3. The study also showed that miR-181 upregulates in ferret and horse sera during early stages of henipavirus infection, suggesting that the host immune response may contribute to disease progression. The findings provide a new mechanism by which henipaviruses exploit host factors to promote infection and cell-to-cell spread. The study highlights the potential of using host miRNAs as targets for henipavirus therapy, as miR-181 downregulates Eph receptors that inhibit henipavirus entry. The study demonstrates the power of functional genomics for understanding the complex interactions between viruses and hosts, and the possibility of targeting host miRNAs to develop novel therapies for deadly viruses.
The paper investigates a large outbreak of undifferentiated fever with haemorrhagic symptoms in Darfur, Sudan that occurred between 2015-2016. Despite a rapid response by the National Public Health Laboratory (NPL) and Rapid Response Teams, the cause of the outbreak was unknown. The NPL collected 26 of 594 cases and analyzed the samples using a range of molecular and serological assays. Only Crimean-Congo haemoragic fever (CCHV) was identified as a cause, but the authors found that 19% of cattle and 2.3% of camels in the region tested positive for CCHV. The majority of CCHV positive samples came from East Darfur, suggesting that CCHV may have played a stronger role in the outbreak there. However, the authors note that the sample integrity and transportation delays likely compromised the ability to identify the cause of the majority of cases. Improving laboratory capacity, especially for CCHV diagnostics, is needed to rapidly identify pathogens during future outbreaks. The lack of complete epidemiological data and missing exposure information also limited the ability to characterize the syndrome and inform public health response. The authors recommend expanding laboratory capacity, collecting more samples and using more detailed case investigation forms to improve diagnostic yield and outbreak control.
This paper investigated the seroprevalence of Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV) in people in western Kenya, where there have been no recent outbreaks. The study found that only 0.8% of the community sampled were seropositive for RVFV, indicating low transmission in the area. Slaughterhouse workers were found to be at higher risk of exposure, with 2.5% of the sample testing seropositive. The risk factors identified for RVFV seropositivity in slaughterhouse workers were slaughtering cattle and being a slaughterman. The study suggests that movement of infected animals may be a key factor in spreading RVFV to unaffected regions. The ELISA test used had a sensitivity and specificity of 10% and 95%, indicating some misclassification of seropositive results. The study highlights the importance of controlling animal movement and implementing measures to prevent the slaughter of infected animals during outbreaks to reduce human cases and transmission.
The paper discusses the impact of insecticide resistance on the efficacy of space sprays for controlling adult Aedes aegypti mosquito populations during dengue fever outbreaks in Martinique. The study found that pyrethroid-resistant mosquitoes were significantly reduced the efficacy of pyrethroid and pyrethrin space sprays against susceptible mosquitoes in the laboratory and field. Deltamethrin sprays were more effective than pyrethrin sprays against susceptible mosquitoes in the field, but still had limited effect against resistant mosquitoes. Synergized pyrethrin sprays were found to be less effective than deltamethrin sprays against both susceptible and resistant mosquitoes. The study highlights the urgent need to develop alternative tools and strategies for controlling adult Aedes aegypti populations, as the current reliance on pyrethroids is at risk due to increasing levels of resistance. This is particularly important given the growing number of countries reporting pyrethroid resistance. The paper recommends further research on using existing molecules in combination to restore efficacy and the development of new molecules for mosquito control.
The paper investigates how vitamin D status during monocyte differentiation influences the function of monocyte-derived macrophages (MΦ) against Mycobacterium leprae. The authors find that sufficient levels of vitamin D during monocyte differentiation into macrophages (IL-15 MΦ) enables the expression of the vitamin D-dependent antimicrobial pathway and induces the antimicrobial peptide cathelicin, leading to a decrease in M. leprae burden. Monocytes differentiated in vitamin D-deficient conditions (IL-10 MΦ) exhibit a distinct phenotype and weak antimicrobial response. However, the addition of vitamin D during monocyte differentiation in sufficient concentrations (SFM) enhances the antimicrobial function of IL-15 MΦ, indicating that sufficient vitamin D levels at the site of infection allow monocytes to differentiate into vitamin D-dependent antimicrobial macrophages that can effectively reduce M. leprae viability. These findings suggest that sufficient vitamin D levels at the site of infection may enhance the antimicrobial response of monocytes and prevent the establishment of infection. Further clinical trials are needed to determine if vitamin D supplementation of individuals with deficient or insufficient vitamin D levels could enhance the macrophage antimicrobial response and prevent the spread of infection.
The paper discusses the role of the protein PAT in the Plasmodium berghei parasite life cycle. PAT is a member of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) of transporters that is essential for parasite transmission from the mosquito vector. The authors used a promoter swap strategy to specifically deplete PAT from sporozoites and found that secretion of the TRAP protein was required for sporozoite motility and transmission to the mosquito vector. In contrast, PAT was not required for egress of gametes or development of blood stage parasites. The failure of Δpat mutants to egress from the red blood cells and dissolve the red blood membranes likely lies in the inability of mutants to secrete G37, a protein that is co-localized with PAT in sporozoites. PAT is required for the fusion of these vesicles with the plasma membrane, allowing their contents to be released into the extracellular space, but additional factors may also be required. The authors propose that PAT acts as a defining membrane component of specialized secretory vesicles in this life stage of the parasite. The paper suggests that PAT could be a potential drug target to inhibit parasite transmission between mosquito and host stages, particularly the sporozoite stage.
The paper presents a new approach to detecting Paracoccidioides spp. in environmental samples using in situ hybridization techniques with species-specific probes. The authors collected soil and aerosol samples from different regions in Brazil and detected Paracoccidioides spp. DNA in soil and aerosol samples in situ using probes targeting the ITS-1-5.8S-ITS2 region. The results showed that both Paracoccidioides brasiliensis and Paracoccidioides lutzii were detected in all regions, with a higher detection rate in soil samples. The soil samples from a rainy season showed higher amplification of Paracoccidioides DNA, suggesting that environmental conditions may influence the distribution of the fungus. The paper also detected new genetic variants of Paracoccidioides spp. in environmental samples, including two clades in soil samples. The study confirmed the coexistence of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis and Paracoccidioides lutzii in environmental samples, and showed that different environmental conditions may influence the sporulation and pathogenesis of these species. The findings provide important insights into the eco-epidemiology of Paracoccidioides and highlight the potential for differential interactions between Paracoccidioides species and their wild hosts. The approach presented in the paper can be useful for mapping the distribution of Paracoccidioides spp. in environmental samples and understanding the factors that influence their pathogenesis.
The paper describes a method for simulating neural networks in two dimensions using a visualization-based approach. The method starts by visualizing a streamline field representing the neural dynamics and then using this visualization to determine the movement of probability mass through the grid. This allows the simulation of neural networks consisting of hundreds or thousands of populations. The method is able to accurately model transients and gain spectra beyond the diffusion limit and can handle complex dynamics like limit cycles and canards. However, handling non-convex cells and merging of trajectories is an ongoing challenge. The method is useful for simulating noise in 2D systems and can serve as a benchmark for faster methods.
The paper describes the purification and characterization of a cysteine-rich secreted protein (CRISP) from the venom of the rattlesnake Crotalus viridis, which they named crovirin. The authors show that croinin has low toxicity to mammalian cells and mouse muscle, and exhibits promising anti-trypanosomatid activity against infective and intracellular stages of Trypanosoma cruzi, Trypanosoma brucei rhodes and Leishmania amazonensis. Croin is effective against T. cruzi trypomastigotes and amastigotes, with lower IC50 values compared to benznidazole and diminazene, and has a higher selectivity index compared to both drugs. Croin also shows activity against the intracellular amastigotes of T. cruzi and L. amazonensis, which are key developmental forms of the parasites that are difficult to treat with current drugs. The authors propose that croin may be useful as a potential drug or lead for developing new chemotherapies for leishmaniasis and Chagas' disease due to its low toxicity and efficacy against intracellular parasite stages.
The paper discusses how the actin cytoskeleton is targeted by the tombusvirus TBSV to promote its replication. TBSV replication requires two viral proteins, p3 and p92. The p3 protein recruits the virus to the cytosolic surface of peroxisomal membranes where the replication complex is assembled, while p92 has RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity. The authors show that the actin cytoskeleton is targeted by TBSV to obstruct the dynamic actin network, which inhibits TBSV replication. The actin cytoskeleton affects the ability of TBSV to recruit host proteins and sterols to the replication sites. Overexpression of the actin depolymerization factor cofilin reduces TBSV replication, while mutations in the actin cytoskeleton that form large actin filaments promote TBSV replication. The authors propose that TBVS uses the existing actin filaments to concentrate host and viral components at replication sites and assemble VRCs. Dynamic actin organization, especially the formation of new actin filaments, limits TBSV replication by inhibiting the normal cellular distribution and function of host proteins and organelles, while stable actin organization provides pro-viral function for VRC formation.
This paper examines the mechanism of how the gradient of the transcription factor Bcd in Drosophila embryos is generated and how the gradient is read out to form a stable pattern. The authors develop two models, a one-dimensional model that neglects the dynamic structural change of the embryo and a three-dimensional model that considers the repeated mitoses of nuclei. They find that the self-averaging mechanism of the Hb protein through diffusion is sufficient to resolve the paradox of signal interpretation, which predicts that large fluctuations in the output signal should be observed. The authors show that the diffusion of Hb molecules averages the distribution of Hb over multiple nuclear cycles, reducing fluctuations. The stable Bcd distribution through rapid transportation of Bcd into nuclei and the precise readout of the Bcd gradient through the self-averaging of Hb is necessary conditions for the stable Hb distribution to be achieved. The models also predict that the stable Bcd distribution through multiple nuclear cycles is a necessary condition for realizing the accurate Hb distribution. The results suggest that the coordinated diffusion of input and output molecules is the basis to generate the stable, precise and reproducible patterning of both input and output molecules. The assumption of self-averaging of output is sufficient to resolve the paradox of signal interpretation, without the need for synchronized gene switching in multiple nuclei.
The paper describes the results of experiments aimed at identifying potential drugs that could be used to combat Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, which is a major infectious disease that kills millions of people worldwide each year. The authors tested a newly synthesized drug called nitazoxanide (NTZ) and found that it could inhibit the growth of Mtb in human macrophages by:   1) Inducing autophagy (aqosomes and degrading Mtb components)  2) Inhibiting the mTORC1 signaling pathway that is important for Mtb survival within macrophages 3) At concentrations that are not toxic to human cells  The authors propose that NTZ may target an upstream mTORC1 regulatory pathway rather than directly inhibiting mTORC1 or autophagy. They found that NTZ inhibited the enzyme quinone oxidoreductase NQO1, which likely contributes to inhibition of mTORC1. This inhibition likely leads to autophagy and inhibition of Mtb proliferation.   The authors also tested NTZ in combination with standard TB drugs and found that it was not affected, suggesting that it could be used in combination with existing treatments to enhance their efficacy. They conclude that drugs like NTZ that inhibit both Mtb proliferation and host cellular defense mechanisms like autophagy may provide new opportunities to combat MTB infection. The paper shows that NTZ is a safe, effective, orally bioavailable drug that could potentially be used to treat TB.
The paper describes a study on the trends of Mycobacterium bovis isolation and first-line drug susceptibility at a tertiary care hospital in Mexico between 2000 and 2014. The study found that the proportion of M. bovis isolates increased from 7.8% in 2000 to 28.4% in 2014, with 26.2% of the isolates being identified as M. bovis. Of the M. bovis isolates, 45.8% were from pulmonary samples and 54.1% were extrapulmonary. The proportion of M. tuberculosis isolates was 79.3% pulmonary and 20.6% extrapulmonary. The study also found that 10.9% of M. bovis and 3.2% of M. tuberculosis were resistant to streptomycin, 7.6% to isoniazid and 5.5% to ethambutol. The primary resistance was higher among new cases compared to treated cases, and the proportion of MDR among new cases was higher than among treated cases. The study highlights the need for proper identification of M. bovis given the high rate of primary resistance to isoniazid and rifampin, which may result in treatment failures and selection for MDR strains. The results suggest that M. bovis is a significant problem in Mexico and underscore the need for more stringent control of tuberculosis, particularly in immunosuppressed patients.
This paper presents a comprehensive catalog of genetic variation in the Drosophila melanogaster population consisting of 39 inbred lines, including single nucleotide polymorphisms, insertions, deletions, and complex variants. The authors used a multi-step approach to identify and validate these variants, including whole genome sequencing data, variant calling algorithms, and comparison to known variants. They found that the Drosophila population contains a high frequency of genetic markers, with an average of one genetic marker every 3 base pairs, and 42% of the genome being composed of deletions and complex variants. They observed that variants are not uniformly distributed across the genome, with autosomal regions containing fewer markers than other regions. They also found that genes affected by disruptive variants are enriched for functional categories related to sensory perception, proteolysis, and innate immune response. They used the variants to identify cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTLs) associated with gene expression levels in young adult flies. The cis-eQTLs were found to be sex-specific, with males showing more associations than females, and the majority of cis-eQTLs were associated with SNPs, indicating that mutations in coding regions have little effect on gene expression in females. They validated the cis-eQTLs using mRNA sequencing of reciprocal hybrids and found significant allele-specific expression in the F1 progeny. The results provide insights into the regulatory architecture of gene expression in Drosophila and suggest that genetic variation, especially indels, plays an important role in governing gene expression, especially in males.
The paper investigates gene-environment interactions for body mass index (BMI) using genetic variants identified through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and self-reported lifestyle data from UK Biobank. They construct a genetic score for BMI (GSBMI) based on 94 SNPs associated with BMI and analyze interactions between GSBMI and 131 lifestyle factors. They find significant interactions between GSBMI and frequency of alcohol intake, frequency of physical activity, socioeconomic status, and smoking status. The interactions are strongest for frequency of alcohol intake, where the genetic effect is attenuated for frequent drinkers compared to non-drinkers. They also observe interactions for light, moderate and vigorous physical activity, and socioeconomic factors. While the study has limitations due to self-reported data and potential confounding, the results suggest that genetic variants interact with environmental factors in complex ways, with some variants interacting in opposite directions. The findings indicate that standardized collection of genetic and lifestyle data in large cohorts like UK Biobank can identify factors that modify the effect of genetic variants on BMI, and may provide insights into the underlying biological mechanisms.
The paper proposes a new method to analyze and interpret single particle trajectories of cell surface proteins using a two-state hidden Markov model. The method can resolve heterogeneous diffusion states and identify the underlying diffusion coefficients and transition probabilities for each state. The authors test their approach on experimental LFA-1 trajectories and show that it can accurately identify two diffusion coefficients and transition probabilities for LFA-1 on T cells. The analysis reveals that LFA-1 diffusion is highly dependent on cytoskeletal interactions, with a freely diffusing state and a state with low mobility that is likely associated with actin cytoskeleton binding. The two-state model is found to be a better descriptor of the data than a single-state model. The method provides new insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics of cell surface proteins and can be used to quantify the effects of different interactions on their mobility. The authors note that their approach is flexible and can be extended to account for additional states or modes of motion, providing a powerful tool for analyzing complex trajectories.
The paper presents a computational analysis of thousands of internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs) from the human genome and different viruses. The authors developed a high-throughput IRES activity assay and used it to identify thousands of novel IRESs, then trained random forests models to predict IRES activity from RNA sequence features. They found that increasing the number of short IRES elements in a sequence leads to higher IRES activity. They identified common k-mer features that are predictive across different sequence groups, including poly-U and pyrimidine tracts. They found that k-mers upstream of the start codon tend to have a positive effect on IRES activity. Positionally, k-mers tend to form islands around positions -50 and -20. They propose that C-rich k-mers may represent imperfect binding sites of PCBP and PTB proteins, while pyrimidine-rich k-mers represent binding sites of PCBP-1 and PTB proteins. Their results suggest that retroviruses preferentially rely on PCBP-1/2 RBPs for cap-independent translation initiation, while dsRNA and (+)ssRNA viruses preferentially use PCBP-2. The authors conclude that IRESs may have evolved independently in different viral compartments, with distinct mechanisms and ITAFs. The study provides insights into how IRESs are regulated and may guide future synthetic IRES design.
This paper describes a systematic approach to detect developmental changes in protein variants, called condition-dependent variants (CDVs), that switch between different protein variants in the human brain. The approach involves analyzing gene expression data from postmortem human brains to identify pairs of genes that show anti-correlated trends in expression over time and age-corrected correlations across subjects. The authors find numerous CDVs, including switching of glycine receptors from α2 to α3 subunits and serotonin receptors from 5-HT1A to 5-HT5A. These CDVs are consistent with studies in rodents, but show different developmental timing and patterns in humans. The results suggest that the brain tunes functional properties of synapses by switching between different protein variants, possibly affecting synaptic plasticity and information processing. The study provides new evidence for developmental regulation of synaptic receptors and highlights the importance of studying CDVs in human brains. The approach could be extended to identify CDVs at the exon level and analyze splicing variants, which may also tune synaptic properties.
This paper describes a Geographic Information System (GIS) based Multi-Criteria Evaluation (MCE) method for mapping areas suitable for Rift Valley Fever (RVF) transmission in Eastern Africa. The method combines expert knowledge and geographic data to identify areas that are suitable for either RVF amplification (local transmission by mosquito vectors) or spread (long-range transmission by movement of infected animals). The method uses a literature review to identify risk factors for RVF amplification and spread and maps these factors for each country. The resulting maps show that areas in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda are suitable for RVF amplification while areas in Ethiopia are more suitable for RVF spread. The maps were validated using livestock outbreak data and found to have a good accuracy, identifying many areas that were previously not known to be at risk of RVF outbreaks. The authors note that the method has limitations, including the lack of vector abundance data, the choice of risk factor weights, and the threshold for defining amplification areas. However, the approach provides a practical and easy-to-update method for identifying areas that can help target surveillance efforts and control measures. The study highlights the importance of considering animal trade and movements in addition to environmental factors to predict RVF transmission. The approach could be improved by incorporating additional risk factors, using more precise data and weights, and taking into account temporal factors like seasonality.
This paper shows that the rate of neutral genetic substitution in a spatially structured population can be affected by the spatial structure of the population. The authors find that the molecular clock rate, or rate of neutral genetic substitution, can be either accelerated or slowed relative to a well-mixed population depending on the birth and death rates across different sites. They find that the molecular clock rate can take any value less than the neutral mutation rate (Nu) if there are no constraints on birth and death rates. The key factor driving the differences in the molecular clock rate is the ratio of birth to death rates across sites. If there is more turnover in one population compared to another, the molecular clock will be accelerated. If birth rates are constant across sites, the molecular clock will be slowed. They also find that the rate of genetic substitution can come arbitrarily close to the neutral mutation rate. The results apply to various evolutionary models, including spatially structured populations with multiple subpopulations, social networks, and somatic evolution in self-renewing cell populations. The findings suggest that spatial structure can have important consequences for the rate of neutral evolution, beyond just promoting cooperative behaviors and genetic variation.
The paper describes a study on the translational regulation of polycistronic mRNA in the non-segmented RNA virus, BDV. BDV encodes three overlapping ORFs within a short 0.8 kb transcript. The authors show that the X and P ORFs are translated predominantly by a reinitiation strategy, following the termination of the uORF, although a leaky scanning mechanism is also implicated. They identify DX1, a RNA helicase, as a regulator of ribosomal reinitiation of X at the 5' UTR. The expression of P upregulates the translation of X, which in turn enhances the translation efficiency of P. The authors demonstrate that DX1 interacts with the 5' UTR of the X/P mRNA and structurally alters the 5' UTR, reducing the ribosomal reinitiation at X. Phosphorylation of DX1 by P also inhibits its interaction with the X/P UTR, which results in upregulation of X translation. The study reveals a novel mechanism of translational regulation in eukaryotic cells mediated by autogenous factors, providing insights into RNA helicases and the regulation of ribosomal reinitiation.
This paper investigates the evolution and function of the bgl operon in Escherichia coli. The bgl operon is repressed by the H-NS global regulator and is often referred to as "cryptic" because it is not expressed in standard laboratory conditions. The study shows that the bgl operon is inherited within modern E. coli strains in three different forms (types I, Ib, and II), which are associated with different clonal structures and phylogenetic groups. The bgl operon is functional in strains of the phylogenetic group B2, which includes uropathogenic and extra-intestinal pathogens, and silencing by H-NS is less strict in these strains. The bgl operon is replaced by a cluster of ORFan genes in strains of the phylogenetic group D. The study suggests that silencing by H-NS is less strict in strains of the phylogenetic group B2, which may provide a selective advantage under certain conditions. The bgl operon is also found to be inactivated by mutations in some strains, and activation of the operon under laboratory conditions is observed in strains of the phylogenetic groups A and B1. The bgl operon is also absent in closely related species E. alberti and Salmonella, suggesting it was acquired by a horizontal transfer from low GC-content Gram-positive bacteria. The results provide insight into the evolutionary history and function of the bgl operon and its association with the clonal structure and phylogenetic diversity of E. coli.
This paper investigates the genetic diversity of the kines gene in Leishmania donovani, a protozoan parasite that causes visceral leishmaniasis, in East African and South Asian strains. The kines gene encodes a protein used in diagnostic tests for visceral leishmaniasis. The authors find that there is extensive genetic diversity in the kines gene among East African strains, including polymorphisms in the repeat regions that may affect the performance of diagnostic tests based on the kines gene. They compare the kines genetic diversity between East Africa and South Asia and find that there is more diversity in South Asia, particularly in the first half of the kines repeats. They suggest that differences in the kines gene may contribute to lower diagnostic test sensitivity in East Africa. They also find that there is more diversity in the HASPB1 and HASPB2 proteins among South Asian strains, which may also affect test performance. They propose that differences in immune competence and antibody levels between human populations in East Africa and South Asia may be a contributing factor. The findings highlight the importance of sustaining collections of Leishmania strains representative of genetic lineages and genetic diversity, targeted analysis of individual strains for comparisons, and the use of comparative genomics to guide the optimization of diagnostic tests. The study suggests that better diagnostic tests and biomarkers are needed to improve the diagnosis and management of visceral leishmaniasis.
The paper proposes a theoretical framework to study how intrinsic noise in complex networks of interacting elements can induce critical behavior leading to avalanching. The framework is based on a leaky Markovian network (LMN) model, where nodes are connected by a probabilistic weighted adjacency matrix. The LMN model exhibits avalanching behavior as the network size decreases, caused by the emergence of noise-induced modes and reallocation of ground states in the stationary potential energy landscape. The authors show that critical behavior in the LMN model is characterized by a discontinuity in the pressure of the thermodynamic variables, such as internal energy, free energy, and bulk modulus. They demonstrate that the emergence of the noise-induced modes and reallocation of ground states is caused by the decreasing network size, leading to avalanching. The results provide a novel understanding of avalanching as a complex behavior that dominates system dynamics at near-critical or subcritical network sizes, caused by appreciable levels of intrinsic noise. The framework provides a link between statistical mechanics and dynamic criticality, demonstrating that principles from statistical mechanics can be effectively used to study critical phenomena in dynamic systems like avalanching.
This paper presents a new method to analyze the linguistic history of the continent of Sahul (present day Australia and New Guinea) using structural features of languages. The authors analyze 121 languages and find that a clustering algorithm called Structure can be used to identify plausible historical groupings of languages based on the similarity of structural features, rather than lexical cognates. This allows for analysis of languages where identifying lexical cognates is difficult due to phonological drift and semantic drift. The Structure algorithm is applied to 160 structural features from the languages in the sample and finds that there are seven major linguistic populations: TNG, South-Papuan, North-West Papuan, North-East Papuan, PN, non-PN, Oceanic, Dark Green, Light Blue, Dark Purple and Light Purple. These populations can be traced back to different migrations and expansions over time, including a recent expansion of the TNG family linked to the development of agriculture around 9,000-6,000 years ago. The analysis shows that there are distinct AN and non-AN groups in the eastern islands, but more convergence in the western islands. The results provide evidence of ancient splits into different groups, including the TNG, South-Papuan, North-West Papuan, North-East Papuan, PN and non-PN groups. The method is able to identify new relationships between languages that were not previously known, and demonstrates that structural features can be used to shed light on population history, even where cognate-based methods are not applicable. The results have implications for understanding the early colonization of Sahul and may be useful for population genetic studies when combined with genetic data.
This paper investigates how the Mediator complex regulates retrotransposition of the Ty1 retrotransposon in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Retrotransposition is a mechanism by which mobile elements can be integrated into the host genome. The authors found that the Mediator complex, which is a transcriptional activator complex, regulates Ty1 retrotransposition by controlling the balance between expression of the internal Ty1i transcript that encodes a dominant negative inhibitor of retrotransposition and expression of the genomic Ty1 transcript. Deletion of non-essential subunits of the Mediator complex resulted in changes in Ty1 retrotransposition levels, consistent with previous findings that individual Mediator subunits influence Ty1 mobility. However, the authors found that Mediator subunits regulate Ty1 retromobility by controlling the balance between expression of the internal Tyi transcript and the genomic Ty1 transcript. Specifically, the tail module of the Mediator complex, which contains subunits Med2-Med15, mediates the retrotransposition of Ty1his3AI, while the head and middle modules regulate expression of the internal Ty1his3AI transcript. The tail module triad specifically controls Ty1his3AI retromobility in an LTR-dependent manner. The authors propose a mechanism by which the tail module triad prevents expression of the internal Tyi transcript, which in turn inhibits retrotransposition. The study provides insights into how a transcriptional activator complex can regulate a post-transcriptional step in retrotransposition.
The paper discusses how the free energy surface (FES) of a complex system can be projected onto a few coordinates to describe its equilibrium and kinetic properties. However, simply projecting the FES onto a suboptimal coordinate can lead to sub-diffusive dynamics, while projecting it onto an optimized reaction coordinate can result in diffusive dynamics. The optimized reaction coordinate is constructed by numerically optimizing the mean first passage time to the native basin. The authors show that for the lambda repressor protein, the dynamics projected onto the optimized coordinate are diffusive while the dynamics projected onto a suboptimal coordinate are sub-diffusive. They argue that the key is to construct an optimized reaction coordinate that can distinguish between the free energy basins, which is not always easy to do in practice. This allows for the dynamics to be described as diffusion on the optimized reaction coordinate, which is more accurate. In contrast, a suboptimal reaction coordinate, like the donor-acceptor distance in single molecule FRET or mean square displacement in neutron scattering experiments, is likely to result in sub-diffusive dynamics. While the optimized reaction coordinate does not necessarily mean the dynamics itself is sub-diffusive, the choice of reaction coordinate can significantly affect the accuracy of the description.
The paper investigates how humans categorize auditory stimuli when the stimulus is ambiguous with respect to its category. The authors developed an experimental task where subjects categorized the frequency of a tone burst into one of two overlapping categories. They found that most subjects learned the category prior probabilities, but showed variability and uncertainty in the learned category distributions. They also found that subjects' behavior was more consistent with probability matching rather than optimal decision strategies. The authors developed a Bayesian model to predict and fit each subject's psychometric function for different category prior probabilities. However, the model predictions were not accurate and the authors found that subjects learned smooth approximations of the box-shaped distributions, rather than the actual objective distributions. Subjects' behavior was more consistent with probability matching, suggesting that they assumed non-stationary categorical priors. The findings suggest that the prevalence of probability matching in perceptual tasks may reflect assumptions about stationarity that are not correct and highlight the importance of considering how subjects assume the environment is stationary, rather than categorization strategies.
The paper discusses how the olfactory system in insects can accomplish two seemingly conflicting goals: generate distinct representations of different odors while maintaining stable representations of repeated odors despite noisy input. The authors propose that both lateral excitatory and inhibitory connections between neurons in the antennal lobe (AL) are necessary to achieve these goals. Lateral excitation recruits more neurons and allows for broadly distributed, temporally structured responses, while slow inhibition reduces activity over longer timescales. They simulate a realistic model of the locust AL and find that a balance of lateral excitation and slow inhibition is required to achieve both goals. Lateral excitation increases the sensitivity of the system by recruiting more neurons that are not directly activated by odor receptors, but this can compromise the reliability of responses to repeated odors. Slow inhibition reduces the spread of activity and introduces reliable variations over longer timescales. The model shows that a balance between lateral excitation and slow inhibition allows for both distinct representations of odors and robust responses to repeated odors. The authors argue that lateral excitatory and inhibitory interneurons in the AL provide functional circuitry that reformats and optimizes odor representations in a way that balances sensitivity to odor differences and robustness to noise.
The paper describes the construction and analysis of a new population of genetically diverse and highly recombinant Arabidopsis thaliana lines called MAGIC (Multi-Parent Advanced Generation Intercross) lines. These lines were constructed by interbreeding 19 natural accessions and then selfing them for 6 generations to produce a stable panel of homozygous inbred lines that do not require repeated genotyping for QTL mapping. The MAGIC lines were used to map QTL for developmental traits like glabrousness and erecta, and vegetative growth rate. The authors applied three QTL mapping methods: fixed effects, empirical Bayes mixed effects, and hierarchical Bayesian methods. The results showed that the MAGIC population had higher mapping resolution and accuracy compared to traditional F2 and RILs, enabling the identification of multiple QTL for small effect traits. The methods were able to detect QTL that were not detected in natural accessions or synthetic populations. The results demonstrated the potential of MAGIC lines for dissecting the genetic architecture of complex traits and improving our understanding of plant growth and development.
The paper describes a new method for assessing the activity of Trypanosoma cruzi parasites in vitro using a VDRL plate with a laser Biospeckle imaging system. The method involves filling the VDRL wells with different amounts of parasites and a drug (benznidazole), and then analyzing the resulting Biospeckle patterns using image processing algorithms. The activity of the Biospeckle pattern is found to be proportional to the number of parasites in the well, regardless of the volume of liquid, and is stable up to around 200 minutes. The method is able to detect changes in the activity of the Biospeckle pattern at concentrations of benznidazole above 1.25μg/mL, which is statistically different from lower concentrations. However, the exact relationship between Biospeckle pattern activity and parasite viability is unknown, and the method is not suitable for determining an IC50 concentration. The authors conclude that the method can be used to statistically differentiate the number of parasites in the well by two orders of magnitude and detect the effect of benznidazole on the Biospeckle pattern, but more studies are needed to elucidate the relationship between Biospeckle activity and parasite viability.
This paper explores how the first genomes emerged from a random pool of RNA sequences. The authors propose that an error threshold, determined by the quasispecies theory, must have existed in order for genomes to emerge. They find that below this threshold, the population of RNA sequences exhibits a "melting" behavior, where errors are more likely to occur, leading to higher fidelity genomes. Above the threshold, the population exhibits "crystallization" behavior, where errors are less likely to occur, leading to lower fidelity genomes. They use a thermodynamic model to describe the evolution of RNA sequences and show that the error threshold is determined by the balance between the thermodynamic force driving error rates and the entropy production. They simulate the replication kinetics of RNA sequences to determine the error threshold and find that it is around 10%. This suggests that the first genomes likely emerged around 10% error rates, consistent with the error threshold predicted by the quasispecies theory. The authors argue that this threshold likely played a key role in the emergence of the first genomes.
This paper describes an experimental approach to measure the relationship between binding site strength and transcriptional output in a promoter. The authors constructed four libraries of the tetracycline resistance gene under the control of an MarA-activated promoter with either the consensus or a weaker binding site for MarA. They placed the binding sites at different spacings from the transcription start site, and observed how the relative fitness of the binding sites changed as they increased the tetracycline concentration. They found that the binding site strength influenced the transcriptional output, with stronger sites being viable at lower tetracycline concentrations and weaker sites being viable at higher concentrations. However, the optimal binding site strength did not always correspond to the highest affinity sites, as a single mutation in a specific binding site could shift the fitness landscape. The authors also found that the spacing between the binding sites affected the transcriptional output, with shorter spacings being viable only at lower concentrations. Overall, the study shows how the strength of individual binding sites, combined with the MarA binding site, can influence the stability of the transcription initiation complex and thus the transcriptional output.
The paper proposes a nonparametric Gaussian process model to analyze the spatiotemporal dynamics of pol II occupancy data measured using ChIP-Seq. The model describes the movement of pol II through the gene body and estimates transcription speeds for genes. It can identify actively transcribed genes by fitting the model to the data and compute transcription rates. The model does not assume a constant transcription speed, allowing it to capture phenomena like pausing, which can vary over the gene body. It also identifies co-regulated gene modules by clustering promoter activity profiles. The authors apply the model to a ChIP-Seq dataset of MCF7 breast cancer cells treated with estrogen to investigate the transcriptional response. They find that the model provides good estimates of transcription speeds and identifies early responding genes. The approach has the advantage of inferring a latent function that links all gene segments, allowing it to filter out genes with non-decreasing delay estimates, and identify genes with pause sites. The model can be used to infer regulator binding and splicing events and has potential applications in regulatory network inference and disease diagnosis.
The paper describes a study that aimed to determine the role of the nucleosome acidic patch in mediating histone ubiquitination and the DNA damage response in mammalian cells. The authors found that the nucleosome acidic patch of histone H2AX and H2A is required for RNF168 and RING1B/BMI1-dependent histone ubiquitination of lysine 15 and lysine 18 of these histones. The nucleosome acidic patch was shown to be directly involved in mediating these ubiquitinations by interacting with the E3 ligases RNF168 and RING1B/BMI1. The authors also showed that expression of a peptide that specifically binds the nucleosome acidic patch of H2AX, LANA, could inhibit RNF168-dependent histone ubiquitination, indicating that the nucleosome acidic patch functions in vivo to promote RNF168-dependent DNA damage signaling. The results suggest that the nucleosome acidic patch participates in promoting both 53BP1 and BRCA1 dependent DNA damage responses by mediating RNF168-dependent histone ubiquitination. The study identified the first nucleosome domain that participates in both histone ubiquitination and the DNA damage response in human cells and provides evidence that histone ubiquitin writers RNF16 and RING1B/BMI1 utilize multivalent chromatin interactions to write their "histone code". The study provides a new tool for studying DNA damage signaling by inhibition and a potential mechanism for viruses to inactivate the DNA damage response.
The paper presents a modeling study to assess the potential transmission of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) in the United States by mosquitoes and vertebrate hosts. The authors combined data from published studies to estimate the vector competence of different mosquito species and the infectiousness of various vertebrate hosts, including mammals, birds, and reptiles. They calculated a "vector amplification fraction" for each mosquito-vertebrate host pair based on the number of infectious mosquitoes resulting from feeding on a single infected host. The results show that mammals, particularly domestic cattle, sheep, and goats, are estimated to be the most important vertebrate hosts for RVFV amplification, contributing 64.3% of the theoretical risk. However, the authors note that there are major gaps in knowledge preventing a comprehensive evaluation of potentially important vectors and vertebrate hosts, particularly the vector competence of invasive mosquito species like Aedes japonicus, Aedes sollicitans, and Aedes sticticus. Future studies are needed to evaluate the dose-dependent vector competence of these mosquitoes and characterize local vector competence in high-risk areas for RVFV introduction. Additionally, evaluating the RVFV viremia profiles of domestic and wild animals in the US, particularly the orders Artiodactyla, Cervidae, Bovidae, and Carnivora, would provide valuable information for proactive management programs.
The paper presents NINJA-OPS, a novel pipeline for marker gene sequencing that leverages the Burrows-Wheeler transform to perform fast and accurate alignment of marker genes to a reference database. The key innovation is the use of a single long reference genome or concatome, composed of concatenated marker genes, which allows NINJA to leverage the benefits of the Burrows-Wheeler transform. The pipeline consists of three stages: filtering, aligning and parsing. The filtering step uses a 3-way radix quicksort to rapidly de-duplicate reads, construct a dictionary and output a reduced-size filtered FASTA file. The alignment step uses a BWT-based aligner to map reads to the reference genome. The alignment is faster and more accurate than existing tools due to the ability to filter out duplicate reads and perform lossy denoising, which can identify reads with probable errors. The pipeline achieves an order of magnitude speedup over existing tools without compromising accuracy, and is more accurate in many cases. The ability to incorporate marker genes and databases makes the pipeline flexible and applicable to situations beyond the original vision. The pipeline has been tested on several datasets and shows that it can be used for marker gene sequencing beyond the 16S marker gene.
This paper presents a study on identifying genetic markers associated with gait in Standardbred horses. The study used genome-wide association analysis (GWA) and whole-genome sequencing to identify genetic variants associated with pacing and trotting gait in a large cohort of Standardbred horses. The GWA analysis identified 19 genome-wide significant markers on 9 chromosomes, which were then prioritized based on their association with gait. Whole-genome sequencing was used to identify additional variants within regions of interest defined by the GWA analysis. A random forest analysis was performed on the Sequenom genotyping data to prioritize the most informative variants. The results showed that 7 genetic variants were able to accurately classify individuals as pacers or trotters with an accuracy of 94% in an independent validation set. The seven genetic variants were located on chromosomes 1, 6, 17, 23, 15 and 30. The study suggests that whole-genome sequencing is a useful approach for identifying genetic markers associated with gait in breeds that exhibit alternative gaits, but notes that many of the identified variants are likely "tagging" functional variants in linkage disequilibrium and may not have a direct role in gait development. The study demonstrates the potential of using genetic markers for marker-assisted selection and training decisions for gaited breeds, but notes that further investigation is needed to determine the functional importance of the identified genes.
The paper describes the identification and characterization of a new anti-apoptotic protein encoded by the poxvirus virus, called v-GAAP. The study shows that v-GAAP is similar in sequence and structure to a previously uncharacterized human protein called h-GAAP that is essential for cell viability and is conserved in multiple tissues. v-GAAP is expressed early in virus infection and localizes to the Golgi, and is dispensable for virus replication in cell culture. Overexpression of h-GAAP or v-GAAP renders cells resistant to apoptosis, while loss of v-GAAP results in cell death by apoptosis. The study demonstrates that v-GAAP inhibits apoptosis induced by multiple pro-apoptotic stimuli from both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways, suggesting that it acts downstream of caspase-8. The viral protein can also complement the function of h-GAAP. The findings suggest that v-GAAP represents a new example of a host gene acquired by the virus to combat the host response to infection and provide virulence.
The paper presents the results of a clinical trial conducted in Uganda to evaluate the use of fractional doses of a tetravalent meningocococcal polysaccharide vaccine (Menomune) to control meningocococcal meningitis outbreaks in sub-Saharan Africa. The study found that a 1/5 fractional dose of the full dose was non-inferior to the full dose in terms of immune response for two of the four targeted serogroups (W15 and Y) in the non-immune population, but not for the serogroup A. However, assuming that a post-vaccination SBA titer ≥128 is a proxy for vaccine efficacy, the 1/5 dose was found to elicit an acceptable increase in SBA titers for non-immune populations. The study also found that the full dose may elicit higher increase in SBA titers for subjects with pre-vaccination SBA titers ≥128 compared to the 1/5 dose. Fractional doses did not affect the chance of response for children under five. The study also found that the IgG concentrations decreased with fractional doses but the SBA titers showed similar results between arms for all serogroups, indicating a higher proportion of bactericidal antibodies in fractional doses. The study suggests that the use of fractional doses could be a useful alternative strategy in mass vaccination campaigns to increase the number of people protected in the short term, particularly for serogroups A and W15 which cause most meningitis outbreaks in Africa, given the current shortage of meningoccal vaccines.
This paper identifies two proteins, TcPR27 and TcPR18, that are found in the rigid cuticle of the elytra of Tribolium castaneum adults and are required for the formation and mechanical properties of the elytra. The proteins are highly abundant in newly emerged adult elytra and are absent in membranous hindwings. The authors show that injection of RNAi against TcPR27 and TcPR18 causes defects in the elytra, including shortened and warped elytra, irregular elytra shape, and reduced mechanical properties. They conclude that TcPR27 and TcPR18 are critical for elytral morphogenesis, mechanical properties and adult survival. The findings suggest that these cuticular proteins are important for transforming the thin membranous forewings into the rigid elytra in Coleoptera. The paper provides evidence of the role of cuticular proteins in defining the morphology and properties of the beetle elytron and rigid body cuticle and highlights the importance of understanding the precise localization and cross-linking of these proteins to fully understand their mechanisms.
The paper describes a new approach to manipulate the sex ratio of mosquito populations using genetic engineering. The authors engineered mosquitoes to express an enzyme called I-PpoI during spermatogenesis that selectively cuts the X chromosome carrying spermatozoa, resulting in a sex ratio biased towards males. They generated two transgenic lines, βPpo1 and βPpo2, where βPpo2 was sterile due to the I-PpoI activity in the testes. They found that the I-PpoI expression in the testes resulted in 80% male spermatozoa, indicating that all spermatoa carried the fusion protein. However, the sterility was due to early embryo lethality caused by the I-PpoI activity, which introduced double strand breaks into the maternal chromosome X. The sterile embryos had both male and female pronuclei, indicating that spermatoa were produced normally but were unable to fertilize the egg. The I-PpoI fusion protein was transferred to all spermatoa regardless of whether they inherited the transgene or not, leading to transmission ratio distortion. The approach shows that synthetic sex distortion mechanisms can be developed, and the transgenic lines meet some requirements for genetically modified mosquitoes for vector control, such as a visible marker for monitoring male dispersal and competitiveness. The results demonstrate the possibility of manipulating maternally inherited genes involved in parasite transmission or sex determination using wild type sperm cells carrying engineered endonucleases. The approach has implications for vector control measures based on genetically modified mosquitoes, as the sterile males will not contain a selectable marker or transformation construct, addressing safety and environmental concerns.
The paper describes the crystal structure of the DNA-binding domain of the latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) protein from the gammaherpesvirus 6 mouse virus. LANA is a key protein that establishes latency in infected cells by binding to episomal DNA and mediating the persistence of the virus genome in dividing cells. The paper shows that the structure of the LANA DNA-binding domain of mouse LANA (mLANA) has a ventral surface that interacts with DNA and is required for DNA binding, while the dorsal surface is involved in the recruitment of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. The positively charged residues on the ventral surface of mLANA are important for DNA binding and the expansion of latently infected B cells. The study shows that mLANA mutations that disrupt DNA binding abolish the ability of the virus to establish latency in mouse cells, demonstrating that LANA DNA binding is essential for persistence in proliferating GC B cells. The structure of mLANA provides advantages for pathogenesis studies in a mouse model of infection and identifies a novel electrostatic patch on the dorsal face of mLANA that plays a key role in the expansion of latently infected B cells.
The paper proposes a new model for how the brain encodes and decodes olfactory information. The model consists of two parts: a generative model based on the Lotka-Rabinich neuronal dynamics equations and a Bayesian inference scheme. The generative model describes the sequential activity of neurons in the antennal lobe and mushroom body, while the Bayesian inference takes the generated activity and infers the hidden states of the Kenyon cells. The model can recognize odors based on the sequential activity of the neurons, even when some neurons fail, and is robust against noise. The model shows that the Kenyon cells behave as intelligent coincidence detectors, receiving information from the activity of multiple neurons and decoding it into a sparse sequence of activations. The model can decode the sparse activity of the Kenyon cells, which is consistent with experimental findings, and provides a mechanistic explanation for phenomena such as the existence of a steady state response and the ability to recognize multiple odors. The model demonstrates that the brain's robustness and ability to recognize odors arises from the combination of sequential activity in the neurons and the Bayesian inference decoding mechanism. The authors argue that the Bayesian inference mechanism is likely how the brain achieves its ability to recognize odors based on sparse activity, and that the model provides a first step towards building real-world machines for artificial olfactory recognition.
The paper examines trends in socioeconomic inequality in body mass index (BMI) across different generations in Britain using data from three birth cohort studies initiated in 1946, 1958, and 1970. The studies found that socioeconomic inequality in BMI persisted across three generations, with those born later in the 20th century showing larger inequalities compared to those born earlier. Inequalities were found in both absolute and relative terms, with the size of the inequalities increasing with age. Specifically, socioeconomic inequalities in BMI were larger among women and among those born more recently. The study suggests that socioeconomic inequality in childhood and adulthood contribute to the persistence of BMI inequalities across generations, with factors such as diet and physical activity likely playing a role. The paper highlights that targeting inequalities in socioeconomic resources in childhood may be particularly beneficial in reducing BMI inequalities, as well as obesity inequalities in childhood. The findings suggest that interventions aimed at disadvantaged populations may be most effective, but coordinated analyses across countries are needed to identify strategies that effectively reduce BMI inequalities.
The paper discusses the potential cost-effectiveness of using miltefosine by caregiver-directed therapy (cDOT) versus the current standard first-line treatment of intramuscular miltefosine for pediatric patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis in endemic regions in Colombia. The authors used a Monte Carlo simulation model to estimate the costs and outcomes of the two treatments from a patient, government payer, and societal perspectives. They found that miltefosine cDOT was less costly compared to intramuscular miltefosine from the patient and societal perspectives, with mean societal costs per cured of $53 and $18 respectively. The government payer perspective also found miltefosine cOT to be less costly with mean costs of $89 compared to $158 for intramuscular miltefosine. However, the study notes that previous studies have estimated higher government payer costs for miltefosine, suggesting that miltefosine cDOT may be cost-effective from this perspective as well. The authors highlight the importance of incorporating the ethical considerations of protecting vulnerable populations and considering the broader social costs of disease and treatment. While the study has limitations, the results suggest that miltefosine cDOT may be a cost-saving option for pediatric patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis, particularly in remote areas where access to clinics is difficult.
The paper investigated the impact of chronic Ascaris lumbricoides infections on immune homeostasis in children by measuring cytokine production and gene expression in unstimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Chronic Ascaris infections were found to be associated with higher levels of GM-CSF, IL-2, IL-5 and IL-10 production compared to uninfected children, which suggests a modified Th2 response. The study identified genes involved in neutrophil-mediated inflammation, immune homeostasis and immune regulation, including CCL23, IDO, HLA-DRB3 and RNASE2. The study also found that chronic infections were associated with downregulation of the microRNA hsa-let-7d. These findings suggest that chronic Ascaris infections modulate the immune response through mechanisms that include the regulation of cytokine production, gene expression and microRNA. The study provides evidence that the development of chronic Ascaris infections may involve a complex interplay between the innate and adaptive immune response.
This paper discusses the ability of immunoglobulins to penetrate the VSG coat on the surface of African trypanosomes, which is a barrier that protects the parasite from the immune system. The authors analyze data from various studies on the binding of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to VSGs on live cells and fixed cells to determine if immunoglobulins can penetrate the VSG coat. They find that some VSGs, like VSG17, allow some immunoglobulins to penetrate into the VSG coat, while others, like VSG18, do not. The authors suggest that the VSG coat is structured to prevent access of immunoglobulins to invariant surface proteins like ISGs, but also has a mechanism to negate any antibody binding to VSGs. However, the data from the studies are limited due to the lack of defined structures, ligands, and ligand binding sites, and most were collected before VSG sequences were sequenced. The authors conclude that some immunoglobulins can penetrate the VSG coat, but the extent of this penetration and the mechanism of the VSG coat's barrier remain unclear. The base of the VSG N-terminal domain, which has the largest cross-sectional area perpendicular to the cell surface, likely represents the real barrier guarding the plasma membrane, while the C-terminal domain may reinforce it. The authors suggest that the combination of low ISG copy number and rapid recycling of the cell surface may limit the ability of immunoglobulins to trigger an immune response.
This paper describes the discovery of a novel sensory modality in Caenorhabditis elegans, the nematode worm, that allows it to detect and respond to ultraviolet light. The authors found that C. elegans has a strong response to short wavelength light, particularly blue-violet light, which it uses to escape damaging doses of direct sunlight. They identified a gene called LITE-1 as the ultraviolet receptor, which functions independently of other known photoreceptors and functions in neurons to mediate the light response. LITE-1 is a member of the gustatory receptor family and is homologous to Gr proteins, which bind small water-soluble molecules. The light response involves an increase in cAMP and DAG in neurons and leads to a coordinated locomotion. The authors showed that LITE-1 functions independently of the Gαq pathway, which is required for normal synaptic signaling, and that light stimulation of neurons can increase internal calcium levels to bypass the need for synaptic signals. The light response also rescues paralyzed synaptic signaling mutants, suggesting that a small subset of neurons can drive a coordinated locomotion response. The findings suggest that C. elegans has evolved this light response as a photobic response to ultraviolet light in its above-ground habitat, where it often lives, and that LITE-1 could be used as a tool for photoactivation of neurons in other organisms.
The paper investigates how the brain integrates different depth cues (binocular disparity and relative motion) to perceive depth in monkeys and humans. The authors find that while both species can integrate depth cues, the integration occurs differently. In monkeys, the area MT appears to be the main area responsible for depth cue integration, with a fusion mechanism that combines the cues to estimate depth. In humans, area V3B/KO is the main area for depth cue integration. However, the monkey area V3B/KO shows only partial integration, while the human area V3B/KO shows less integration and more sensitivity to relative motion cues. The fusion mechanism in monkeys appears to be more robust, allowing the brain to maintain depth perception even when cues conflict. The results suggest that the fusion of depth cues is likely an evolutionary adaptation that has occurred in primates. The findings provide evidence for a fusion mechanism for depth perception, although the integration of depth cues may occur in different brain areas across species.
The paper describes a computational method for inferring signaling networks that control the phosphorylation of proteins during stress responses in yeast. The method uses graph-based optimization algorithms to identify subnetworks from a larger protein-protein interaction network that explain how different phosphorylation events are coordinated by upstream regulators. The authors applied their method to data from phospho-proteomics experiments that showed changes in protein phosphorylation in response to osmotic shock, identifying novel regulators and connections between them. The method predicted connections between Hog1, Pde2, and Cdc14 that were not previously known. It also identified new connections between Hog1 and cell cycle regulators, and predicted that Rck2 is regulated by Pde2. The method outperformed other network inference methods in incorporating mutant data and identifying new targets of Hog1 and PKA. The results provide insights into how cellular signaling is coordinated during stress responses, highlighting new regulators of the HOG and PKA pathways. The approach has the advantages of being able to predict phosphorylation targets that have not been physically interacted with known regulators and capture feedback loops.
This paper investigated the role of the miRNA miR-202 in the development and reproduction of the medaka fish. The authors found that miR-202 is expressed in the granulosa cells of the ovary and plays a key role in early follicular growth and development, particularly in female fecundity. They showed that miR-202 is required for the formation of functional gametes in both male and female gonads, as knockout of miR-202 resulted in reduced reproductive success, including a reduced number of eggs spawned and eggs that cannot be fertilized. They also found that miR-202 regulates the expression of key genes involved in steroidogenesis and folliculogenesis, including star, cyp19a1a, cyp17, and inhibin, and showed that the downregulation of these genes in miR-202-deficient ovaries indicates that miR-202 is necessary for the early steps of follicular growth. The authors identified several potential targets of miR-202, including STAT3 and clockb, which may play a role in the regulation of the circadian clock. The study provides the first in vivo evidence that a gonad-predominant miRNA is necessary for female reproduction and sheds light on the regulatory mechanisms that control the early steps of follicular development in fish ovaries, and highlights the potential of miR-202-deficient fish as a novel biological model for studying the role of miRNAs in reproduction.
The paper argues that loss-of-function (null) mutations, rather than gain-of-function mutations, are an important mechanism for bacterial adaptation to novel environments. The authors find that through rewiring of existing cellular metabolic and regulatory networks, null mutations can improve fitness in extreme environments where bacteria lack the necessary enzymatic functions. They perform a meta-analysis of 14 fitness data sets across 7 studies to show that adaptive null mutations are abundant, particularly affecting enzymes and regulatory proteins, and that the mechanisms by which they improve fitness involve reducing flux variability and rewiring metabolic pathways. They then use transposon mutagenesis to identify single loss-of-function mutations in E. coli that improve fitness in extreme nutrient-limited environments, showing that such mutations can significantly increase growth rates. The results suggest that loss-of-function mutations are a common early step in bacterial evolution, allowing cells to exploit their existing capabilities more effectively in new conditions. The findings have implications for understanding bacterial adaptation in chronic infections, engineering bacteria for novel environments, and culturing "unculturable" species that require rewiring of existing metabolic networks.
The paper presents a computational model of cortical circuits based on the Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) theory. The HTM theory posits that the neocortex uses a hierarchy of nodes to model the world, each node learning spatial patterns and then learning a mixture of Markov chains over the set of patterns. The authors derive a mathematical expression of how a node in the hierarchy performs belief propagation and inferences, which they then map onto a neuronal implementation. They then map this neuronal implementation onto anatomical data of cell types, layers, and microcircuits in the cortex. They show that an HTM vision system can exhibit the subjective contour effect, which is a known cognitive phenomenon where humans perceive edges in regions where there is no direct evidence. They argue that the theoretical model provides a good starting point for a biologically grounded model of cortical circuits, but there are still many aspects that are not accounted for in the current model and the merger of theory and anatomy provides non-trivial insights. The work demonstrates that a biologically grounded model can guide the refinement of the theory and the theory can make testable predictions about the biology.
This paper describes the discovery of a zebrafish mutant that has a defect in hematopoiesis, specifically in definitive hematopoies. The mutant, called topbp1cas03, was identified through a forward genetics screen and positional cloning approach. The mutation was found to be a nonsense mutation in the topbp1 gene, which encodes a protein involved in DNA replication stress response. The topbp1cas03 protein was found to be mislocalized and truncated, lacking its 8th BRCT domain and putative NLS. This led to an accumulation of DNA damage and increased apoptosis of hematopoietic stem cells, starting from 3 days post fertilization. The authors propose that the loss of nuclear localization of topbp1cas03 directly caused the hematopoietic failure in the mutant. The work suggests that the DNA damage response pathway is essential for definitive hematopoies and that TopBP1 plays an essential role in this process. The study provides a unique model for investigating mechanisms of hematopoietic failure, particularly in cases where the failure is caused by defective DNA replication stress response.
The paper describes a study evaluating the efficacy of intravenous levofloxacin treatment for preventing death from lethal Yersinia pestis infection in African Green monkeys. The authors exposed the monkeys to a lethal dose of Y. pestis CO92 by aerosol and then treated them with either levofloxacin initiated after the onset of fever or levofloxacin initiated after the monkeys became moribund. All monkeys treated with levofloxacin survived until the end of the 28-day study period while all untreated monkeys died. The study showed that the timing of treatment initiation, initiating treatment after fever onset, and the choice of dosing schedule were important factors in determining the efficacy of treatment. The African green monkey model was found to be suitable for testing the efficacy of treatment for pneumonic plague, as the monkeys exhibited a rapid course of disease with fever and pneumonia, and levofloxacin was found to be effective in treating established pneumonia. While the study did not directly evaluate the late efficacy of levofloxacin treatment, it suggests that the antibiotic would likely be effective in preventing bubonic plague as well given its broad spectrum of activity against Y. pneumococococcus. The authors propose that a clinical trial of levofloxacin could be undertaken for the treatment of bubonic plague in humans.
The paper investigates how the bacteria Porphyromonas gingivalis evades autophagy and survives within immune cells, specifically myeloid DCs, to promote chronic infection. The bacteria has a minor fimbria (Mfa1) that binds to the DC-SIGN receptor on the surface of DCs, allowing it to internalize and evade the conventional endocytic pathway and autophagy pathway. This routing is distinct from the major fimbria (FimA) that targets TLR2. Engagement of DC-SIGN by Mfa1 allows P. gingivalis to persist within DCs, while TLR2 signaling activates autophagy. The bacteria expresses Mfa1 in response to environmental cues such as pH and temperature. The study shows that P. gingivalis can survive within DCs by evading autophagy through coordinated regulation of Mfa1 and FimA expression. This allows it to disseminate and persist in tissues, potentially contributing to chronic inflammatory diseases. The findings suggest that P. gingivalis' ability to regulate fimbrial expression and evade autophagy may play a role in its pathogenicity and dissemination in disease.
This paper describes a genetic screen to identify genes involved in regulating the production of pheromones in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. The screen identified 12 genes that contribute to the production of cuticular hydrocarbons, which are used in mate choice and other behaviors. One of these genes, spidey, was found to regulate the levels of ecdysteroids, which in turn affect the viability of oenocytes, leading to changes in the cuticular hydrocarbon profile. Silencing spidey expression in oenocytes resulted in a loss of oenocytes and a decrease in cuticular hydrocarbon production, leading to reduced stress resistance, desiccation resistance, and lifespan. The results suggest that oenocyte viability throughout adulthood depends on ecdysteroid signaling, and that the loss of ecdysteroids during early adulthood can have long-lasting effects on oenocyte development and cuticular hydrocarbon production. The findings provide evidence for the role of ecdysteroid hormones in regulating pheromone biosynthesis and suggest that environmental and physiological cues can modulate pheromone production via ecdysteroid signaling.
The paper presents a study on how humans plan their actions when faced with a decision that requires prospective computation. The researchers designed a task where participants had to choose a path through a branching stimulus to maximize their accumulated reward. They analyzed human behavior using various methods to quantify the depth of computation and recalculation period used by participants. They found that humans traded off the depth of computation against the frequency of recalculation, with larger depths resulting in less frequent recalculation. They also found that humans did not use simplifying heuristics like seeking large or small rewards, but instead took into account all the information within their current depth of computation. The results suggest that humans place high priority on representing the spatial layout of the visual scene, which is likely processed in posterior parietal cortex. The authors conclude that the computational capacity of such mechanisms limits the ability for prospective visual behavior and the speed at which computations must be made, and propose future research to explore this further using brain imaging and behavioral methods. The study provides insights into human prospective computation and decision making in complex dynamic environments.
The paper describes the spikefinder challenge, a community-based competition where researchers were asked to develop algorithms to infer spike rates from calcium imaging data. Ten algorithms were submitted, which showed improved performance compared to previously evaluated methods. The algorithms were based on different principles, including generative models, deep neural networks, and hybrid approaches. While the algorithms were generally similar in terms of performance, they had different strengths and weaknesses, such as computational efficiency, interpretability, and adaptability to new data. The challenge demonstrated the potential of community-based benchmarking to catalyze algorithmic developments in neuroscience and highlighted the need for standardized metrics and data. The algorithms provided a solid basis for further advancing the field, but the optimal algorithm to choose depends on factors like performance, simplicity, run time, and model complexity. The challenge was successful in showing that a range of approaches can achieve good performance and highlighting the need for more comprehensive data and new indicators to push the state-of-the-art further.
The paper investigates the mechanism underlying Wolbachia-mediated antiviral resistance in Drosophila melanogaster against the alphavirus Sindbis virus (SINV). The authors find that Wolbachia infection leads to increased expression of the host DNA/RNA methyltransferase gene Mt2, which in turn inhibits SINV RNA synthesis at an early stage of in the virus replication cycle. This results in reduced virus titer and particle production. They identify Mt2 as a key factor mediating Wolbachia-induced antiviral resistance. While Wolbachia-infected flies have reduced virus titer, the Mt2 expression is lost upon SINV infection. The authors propose that Mt2 may inhibit viral RNA synthesis by altering the methylation status of the viral RNA, which in turn affects its stability or usage as a template for translation. The study provides evidence that Wolbachia-induced Mt2 expression is required for Wolbachia-mediated antiviral resistance, and that the mechanism likely involves Mt2 interacting with the SINV RNA. Further work is needed to determine the exact nature of the Mt2-SINV RNA interaction and how Mt2 modulates virus replication. The findings suggest that Wolbachia-mediated antiviral resistance may be an effective strategy for controlling arthropod-borne viruses, but more research is needed to understand the molecular details.
The paper describes a study that aimed to determine the role of the ligand FGF20 (FGFR1) and its receptor FGFR1 in the development of the organ of Corti in the inner ear. The authors found that loss of FGF20 signaling leads to a delay in prosensory specification and premature differentiation, resulting in a more severe phenotype in the basal end of the cochlear duct. The authors propose that FGF20 regulates the temporal buffer between specification and differentiation, with Sox2 and Fgf20 interacting to modulate the borders of this buffer. They showed that Fgf20-KO mice, which have a normal prosensory domain but lack Fgf20 expression, exhibit a milder phenotype compared to Fgf20-null mice that lack Fgf20 expression. In contrast, Fgf20-het mice that have a reduced level of Sox2 expression exhibit a more severe phenotype compared to Fg20-null mice, suggesting that Sox2 regulates the temporal buffer. The authors conclude that FGF20/FGFR1 signaling is involved in differentiation rather than prosensory specification.
The paper describes the development and evaluation of an open-source mobile app called VectorPoint that provides risk maps to help health inspectors select houses to survey for Chagas disease vectors. The app generates risk estimates based on data from previous inspections and the attack phase of a vector control campaign. During a field trial, inspectors who used the app visited significantly more high-risk houses compared to those who used paper maps. Inspectors also showed evidence of using the risk information in their decision-making, such as skipping lower-risk houses and adjusting their movement patterns. While the results suggest the app can enhance vector surveillance, there were still some inspectors who did not show any signs of using the risk information and the app's utility may depend on individual factors. The authors note that the model behind the app increases as more data are collected, and that future versions could improve spatial coverage and exploration-exploitation tradeoffs. The app is cloud-based and open-source, making it easy to deploy and adapt to other diseases. However, its success depends on the availability of cellular network coverage and human expertise to maintain the backend components.
The paper presents a high-resolution mapping of origins of replication (ORIs) in mouse embryonic stem cells using a novel algorithm that can identify replication initiation sites in a genome-wide manner. The authors found that the majority of ORIs are associated with annotated transcriptional units, with CpG island promoters showing the highest efficiency. They also found that the replication initiation sites at CpG islands are strongly correlated with the transcription start sites of the genes, and that the most efficient ORIs are associated with early embryonic expression. This suggests that transcription initiation early in development sets the probability of ORI firing. The authors propose that active promoters in germ cells and early embryonic cells recruit pre-RC and acquire the ability to drive replication, transmitting an epigenetic state that enables efficient replication initiation. The results support the "many are called, but few are chosen" model of ORI specification and provide experimental evidence for the co-evolution of regulatory regions driving replication and transcription initiation.
The paper describes the discovery of a mechanism of long-distance communication and kind recognition in the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa. The authors found that genetically identical cells can distinguish themselves from non-identical cells through a mechanism involving the DOC-1 and DOC-2 proteins, which oscillate out of phase with the SOFT protein during chemotropic interactions. This allows genetically identical cells to coordinate their behavior while avoiding self-stimulation. The DOC proteins are paralogous and mediate assortative kind recognition by negatively regulating interactions during germling fusion. The authors identified five communication groups, each defined by distinct haplotypes at three linked loci. The communication locus is under long-term balancing selection, which suggests that recombination within the locus is reduced, allowing the maintenance of polymorphisms. The mechanism of kind recognition mediated by DOC proteins adds complexity to germling communication and allows cells to avoid self-stimulation. The authors propose a model in which a communication ligand/receptor is activated in the receiving cell, transmitted intracellularly to DOC-1/DOC-2, which together function in quality control. The authors provide evidence for this mechanism through genetic and genomic analysis, including deletion mutants and genealogical concordance analyses. The findings provide a basis for research into self/non-self recognition mechanisms in other eukaryotic species, particularly in filamentous fungi.
This paper discusses how the insulin signaling pathway in Caenorhabditis elegans, a nematode worm, is involved in regulating life span. The insulin signaling pathway has two distinct states: a reproductive state where it promotes cell proliferation, and a longevity state where it activates protective mechanisms. The pathway is primarily regulated by the transcription factor DAF-16FOXO. The authors found that mutations that strongly reduce insulin signaling, like those in the age-1 gene, result in extremely long-lived adults that are resistant to oxidative stress. They found that the reduced insulin signaling leads to transcriptional silencing of many genes involved in the insulin signaling pathway, including kinases and transcription factors. This silencing likely contributes to the exceptional longevity of these mutants. The authors propose that the mutants are trapped in a non-adaptive state that is unable to respond to environmental and internal signals, and the low insulin signaling state is self-sustaining. The authors suggest that the mechanism that allows this longevity state is a "flip-flop" circuit involving both kinase and transcriptional signals.
The paper describes the induction of resistance to drug combinations in Leishmania parasites using a step-wise adaptation process. They found that Leishmania parasites can develop resistance to different drug combinations, including MLF/PMM and SbIII/PMM, with higher resistance indices than resistance to single drugs. The resistance was confirmed in both promastigote and intracellular amastigote forms. The study showed that the cross-resistance profile to different anti-leishmanial drugs was different between promastigote and intracellular amastigote forms. The results suggest that the resistance phenotype of the induced drug combination resistance is unstable. The study also found that Leishmania parasites develop an increase in cellular thiol redox metabolism as a drug-detoxification mechanism to protect against drug-induced loss of ATP and mitochondrial membrane potential. The findings provide valuable insights into the development of resistance to drug combinations for the treatment of leishmaniasis and suggest that optimal drug combinations will need to be tailored to different Leishmania species. The results highlight the importance of further research into combination regimens that are given for a short period and at lower dose to minimize the risk of resistance emergence.
The paper explores the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in replicative senescence, which is the gradual accumulation of cellular damage that leads to age-related decline and disease. The authors find that mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with replicative senescence in human fibroblasts, which is characterized by high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and low mitochondrial membrane potential. They propose that the increase in ROS production is an adaptation to high levels of cellular ROS, which triggers the retrograde response, a mechanism that induces a variety of cellular changes including increased mitochondrial biogenesis and activation of Ca2+-dependent signaling pathways. This results in cellular senescence. The authors find that mitochondrial dysfunction and the resulting retrograde response are linked, as they both involve upregulation of uncoupling proteins, which in turn slows down telomere shortening. They show that cell-to-cell variation in mitochondrial ROS production determines cell-to-cell variation in replicative senescence, which is evident in the marked heterogeneity in lifespan among cultures of human fibroblasts. The results suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction and the retrograde response are a conserved mechanism of cellular aging from yeast to mammals.
The paper investigates how tissue inflammation and cell division interact to influence the risk of DNA damage-induced genetic mutations in pancreatic tissue. The authors created a mouse model called FYDR that can detect DNA recombination in intact tissues, enabling them to study the interplay between DNA damage and cell proliferation in vivo. They found that acute inflammation causes DNA double strand breaks, which can induce homologous recombination, but cell division during the acute phase of inflammation acts as a barrier to DNA damage-induced recombination. However, if cell division occurs during the subsequent proliferative phase of inflammation, the barrier is breached and there is a synergistic increase in homologous recombination events. This suggests that inflammation-induced proliferation sensitizes tissue to DNA damage and alkylating agents, which can cause mutations. The study shows that inflammation-induced hyperproliferation can act synergistically with alkylating agents to induce DNA recombination events, which has implications for cancer risk. The results highlight the importance of considering a person's physiological state when assessing cancer risk, particularly for chronic inflammatory conditions.
This paper investigated the role of genetic polymorphisms in controlling Trypanosoma brucei rhodesis infections in northern Malawi. The authors genotyped 96 single nucleotide polymorphisms in 17 genes and found an association between the APOL1 G2 variant and reduced susceptibility to T.b. rhodesis infections. This is the first study to show such an association in Malawi, consistent with previous studies in Uganda and Guinea. The APOL1 G2 variant was found to reduce susceptibility by 7-fold. However, the study also found that the G1 variant did not associate with T.b. rhodes infections in Malawi, in contrast to studies in Guinea where it was protective. The G2 variant was found to provide resistance through its inability to bind to SRA and lyse the parasites. The study highlights the complexity of genetic associations with HAT in different populations and the need for further studies to determine the effect of the G1 variant on T.b. rhodes infections and gene expression. The findings suggest that genetic polymorphisms may play a role in controlling morbidity in HAT.
The paper proposes an algorithm called fastcore for context-specific metabolic network reconstruction. The algorithm takes as input a core set of reactions that are known to be active in a given context and searches for a flux consistent subnetwork of the global network that contains all reactions from the core set. The key insight is that consistency testing can be defined via a set of sparse modes of the global network, and this allows an efficient search strategy that maximizes the flux cardinality of the reactions in the core set. This approach is contrasted with existing algorithms that first prune the network and then check consistency, which can be computationally expensive. Fastcore iteratively expands the active set starting with the core set and minimizes the L1 norm of the fluxes, resulting in fewer iterations and faster reconstructions. The results show that fastcore is significantly faster and produces more compact models than existing context-specific reconstruction algorithms, especially when applied to liver data. However, the authors also demonstrate that fastcore can obtain functionally relevant reconstructions by adding reactions not included in the core set if necessary. The paper argues that the ability to efficiently reconstruct models that are compact but also capture alternative pathways is important for biological relevance.
The paper describes a method to identify "axes of variation" in gene expression across healthy individuals that could potentially predict disease risk. The authors find that there are nine major axes of gene expression variation that are highly conserved across two healthy adult studies and are associated with different biological functions like immune response, inflammation and metabolism. They show that genes associated with these axes tend to be co-regulated across studies and are differentially expressed under different disease conditions. The axes are found to be repeatable across different blood cell types and are enriched for genes related to inflammation, viral response and signaling within specific cell types. The authors propose that the axes may shape an individual's response to genetic and environmental challenges and potentially predict disease risk. The axes are associated with biological processes like immune response and metabolism and can be used as biomarkers for disease. The authors argue that the axes may be a key factor in constraining gene expression and influencing disease susceptibility.
The paper proposes a framework for understanding the relationships between complexity, connectivity and stability of large biological systems, specifically metapopulations of patches distributed in space. The authors derive a simple persistence criterion for metapopulations that is controlled by the spectral radius of the adjacency matrix, which represents the connectivity between patches. They show that connectivity enhances persistence, while less connected patches are disadvantaged and lose recruits. They examine three network topologies and find that connectivity and the existence of cycles in the network play key roles in determining persistence. The framework allows exploration of how network motifs and fine-scale features influence persistence. The results show that connectivity, heterogeneity in connectivity and the existence of cycles in the network are important factors that enhance persistence, while age structure and more complex migration schemes play a role in determining which patches survive. The framework has conservation applications and could guide the design of marine protected areas and management of metapopulations. The paper's findings reveal new insights into how network structure and connectivity affect the stability of metapopulations and provide principles for managing complex systems.
The paper describes the use of CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing to investigate the function of the Drosophila transcription factor ZLD. The authors used CRISPR-Cas9 to generate mutations in conserved domains within ZLD and examined the resulting phenotypes to determine if the domains were essential for viability and fertility. They found that mutations in the second zinc finger of ZLD, which is the most conserved domain, caused maternal-effect lethality due to increased ZLD-mediated transcriptional activation. This suggests that the early embryo is particularly sensitive to ZLD activity, and that too little or too much is lethal. The authors propose that a cofactor that binds this domain specifically in the early embryo may be responsible for the maternal-specific lethality. They also found that ZLD hyperactivity resulted in precocious activation of zygotic genes and precocious degradation of maternal RNAs, leading to misregulation of genes essential for embryonic development. The results demonstrate that ZLD activity is strictly controlled and must be precisely executed during the transition from a specified germ cell to a population of totipotent cells. The authors propose that rapid transitions in cell fate, such as during the maternal-zygotic transition, require tight control of master regulators of these cell changes to ensure proper development.
The paper discusses the genetic circuitry that regulates the transition from yeast to hyphae in the fungal pathogen Candida albicans. The authors identify Mfg1 as a previously uncharacterized regulator of morphogenesis in Candida that plays a key role in the transition, while Flo8 and Msg1 are well characterized regulators. They find that while Flo8 and Msg1 are required for most transitions, Msg1 is dispensable for some filamentations in response to different stimuli. They show that Msg1 physically interacts with both Flo8 and Msg1 under basal conditions. However, the mechanisms by which Msg1 regulates filamentation remain unknown. To better understand the role of Msg1, they employ a novel evolutionary approach to evolve mutants that can filament in the absence of Msg1. They find that aneuploidy formation, specifically increasing chromosome 6 copy number, can restore filamentation in the absence of Msg1. This suggests that Msg1 may be involved in hyphal extension rather than initiation of filamentation. Overall, the study highlights the complexity of the regulatory circuitry governing the transition between yeast and hyphae in Candida albicans, and identifies Mfg1 as a key regulator that plays a novel role in the process.
The paper investigates how the replication of a second chromosome (Chr2) is coordinated with the replication of the first chromosome (Chr1) in the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. The two chromosomes have different sizes and replicate at different times, with Chr2 replicating after Chr1. The mechanism of Chr2 replication initiation is not well understood. The authors find that doubling the number of a specific gene (crtS) that regulates Chr2 replication, without requiring the act of replicating it, is sufficient to trigger Chr2 replication. This suggests that replication helps to remodel the initiator protein RctB, which is limiting for Chr2 replication. The results suggest that unreplicated crtS copies have activity, though the exact mechanism is not clear. The authors propose that doubling the crtS copy number raises the activity above the threshold required for initiating replication, which then allows the initiator to function. The ability to follow the consequences of crtS excision in real-time allowed them to determine that a single unreplicated crtS copy has significant but insufficient activity.
The paper describes an analysis of a cohort of over 50,0000 adults in the UK who were prescribed lansoprazole, omeprazole, or pantoprazole for gastric acid symptoms, and were followed for 1-2 years to see if they were at lower risk of developing tuberculosis (TB). The researchers found that compared to those prescribed omeprazole or pantoprazole, those prescribed lansoprazole had a lower rate of TB disease, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.65 (0.51-0.84). This association was seen even after adjusting for potential confounding variables and censoring follow-up at the end of treatment. The study suggests that lansoprazole may have some clinical activity against MTB, consistent with in vitro studies that showed lansoprazole was active against drug-sensitive and drug-resistant MTB strains. However, the study was limited by not being able to assess the optimal dose of lansoprazole needed for MTB treatment or the effect of lansoprazole on TB diagnosis. The results suggest that lansoprazole may be a useful addition to current TB treatment regimens, but further studies are needed to confirm this.
The paper discusses the role of arginase (ARG) activity in Leishmania major and Leishmania tropica infections. The authors found that ARG activity in the logarithmic growth phase of the parasites is higher than in the stationary phase. They also found that pathogenic Leishmania infections in susceptible mice result in higher ARG activity at the site of infection and in draining lymph nodes, while resistant mice infections have lower ARG activity. This suggests that higher ARG activity is associated with uncontrolled parasite growth and disease progression. The authors propose that the parasites may activate ARGs in macrophages, which then enhance parasite survival by depleting L-arginine and reducing NO levels. They conclude that ARG activity is a pivotal element in the outcome of cutaneous leishmaniasis, and that understanding its role in Leishmania parasites may provide valuable insights for vaccine and treatment development.
The paper proposes a new method for modeling the binding preferences of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) based on their structural contexts. The authors introduce an annotation scheme called RNAcontext that annotates RNA sequences in terms of their structural context, including paired, unpaired loop, hairpin, bulge, internal loop, etc. They use this annotation scheme to train a motif model that considers multiple structural contexts for each RBP. They show that their RNAcontext motif model can accurately predict the binding preferences of RBPs from quantitative RNAcompete data, outperforming existing motif finding methods that consider a single structural context or do not model RNA structure. The RNAcontext model is trained on the RNAcompete data and can also predict binding preferences for RBPs from in vitro and in vivo. The authors find that the structural context of the binding site is important for accurate prediction of RBP binding preferences and that their RNAcontext motif models match previously reported binding sites. They conclude that RNAcontext represents an advance over existing methods for modeling RBP binding preferences, which may be due to the ability to capture the flexibility of RNA compared to DNA.
This paper investigates the cellular factors involved in the unusual cell entry pathway of Old World arenaviruses like Lassa fever virus (LASV) and Lassa virus (LASV). The authors use recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudotypes bearing LASV or LCMV GPs as a surrogate to study the entry pathway of LASV and LCMV. They find that cell entry of LASV and LCMV pseudotypes requires microtubules and phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3K activity. Infection of cells with the pseudotypes is dependent on LBPA and the ESCRT proteins Hrs, Tsg101, Vps2, and Vps24. Co-localization studies indicate that the virus transiently passes through a compartment associated with Tsg101 before entering late endosomes. The authors propose a working model for LASV and LCMV cell entry where the virus-receptor complex is internalized and then sorted into ILV within the MVB/late endosome, allowing the virus to penetrate the endosome through back-fusion at the level of the late endosome. The low fusion pH of LASV and LCMV suggests that the fusion event occurs in a late endosome. The findings suggest that LASV and LCMV use a pathway bypassing classical endosomal trafficking routes to enter cells.
The paper summarizes evidence from over 2000 observational studies across 15 countries on the association between socioeconomic position (SEP) and healthcare received in the last year of life. The studies showed that low socioeconomic position (SEP) is associated with increased odds of dying in hospital, rather than at home, receiving acute care in the last 3 months of life, and reduced odds of receiving specialist palliative care in the last year of life. The studies used a range of measures of SEP, including area deprivation, education, income, occupation, housing quality and social class. The association between SEP and place of death was strongest, with people in the most deprived areas more likely to die in hospital than those in the least deprived areas. However, there were some differences in the strength and direction of the associations between different measures of SEP for different outcomes. The findings suggest that socioeconomic inequality persists in end-of-life care and may be an important factor in shaping healthcare received towards the end of life. The paper recommends that studies and interventions should account for socioeconomic position and consider the different effects across different social groups.
The paper describes a genetic dissection of the quorum sensing pathway that regulates differentiation in African trypanosomes. The authors used extragenic suppression to identify the genes that are required for the response to the signaling molecule stumpy factor, SIF. They created null mutants for these genes and then ectopically expressed the genes in the null mutants to assess their ability to differentiate to stumpy forms. They found that some genes were required for differentiation, while others were redundant. The paper also identified inhibitors of stumpy formation and phosphoproteomic changes that occurred in response to stumpy factor depletion. The authors propose two models for the differentiation pathway, with one involving two branches, one dependent on the kinase YAK and the other on the gene RBP7. The study highlights the complexity of the differentiation pathway and the non-linear nature of its regulation. The results demonstrate that cell cycle arrest does not always result in stumpy formation, and that the expression of some genes requires the presence of other genes in the pathway. The study used pleomorphic cell lines to assess differentiation parameters and phosphoproteomic analysis to identify changes in response to gene depletion.
The paper analyzes protein-protein complexes involving homologous proteins binding to different partners to investigate promiscuous protein binding at the family level. The authors find that while the binding sites of the homologous proteins exhibit significant similarity, the binding sites of the different partners exhibit only weak similarity. They conclude that different proteins use their own binding strategies to recognize their partners. They suggest that promiscuous binding may involve atom groups interacting specifically with a single partner rather than common binding sites. The results suggest that there may be generic binding modules in the promiscuous binding sites, but the authors were unable to confirm this. The authors also find that evolutionary conservation is not a good discriminant of hotspots, but it can improve hotspot prediction when combined with other features. They highlight the importance of considering the structure of the binding sites, as opposed to just the atomic or residue-based representations.
The paper describes a new method for detecting Trypanosoma cruzi antigens in urine using nanotechnology. The authors developed hydrogel nanoparticles functionalized with different dyes that can capture and concentrate T. cruzi antigens in urine. They showed that the poly(NIPAm/TB) particles were the most effective at capturing T. cruzi antigens, protecting them from enzymatic degradation. They tested the method on urine samples from infants with congenital Chagas disease and found that it could detect T. cruzi antigens in a single urine specimen at one month of age with a sensitivity of 90.3% and specificity of 96.5%. The method was more sensitive than microscopy and PCR, which typically require multiple samples, and it could detect T. cruzi antigens in urine from infants that were missed by other diagnostic tests. The authors believe that this method has the potential to enable early point-of-care diagnosis of congenital Chagas disease in resource-limited settings.
The paper describes a study that identifies a genetic locus that affects female fecundity in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. The researchers used quantitative trait mapping and RNA interference (RNAi) experiments to identify a chromosomal region that affects fecundity in the population. They found that a genomic interval between bands 47D-4E on chromosome 2R contains the causative polymorphism. They identified four genes within this interval, including the aquaporin gene Drip, which is expressed in neurons in the brain and modulates fecundity. The expression of Drip in neurons reduces fecundity. The authors propose that natural variation in Drip affects the physiological basis for environmentally dependent life history trade-offs by altering corazonin and dopamine production, which in turn affects stress resistance and activity. The study suggests that genetic variation in Drip that modulates fecundity may be subject to balancing selection because it modulates the physiological basis for these trade-offs.
The paper describes the discovery of a new transducing phage, ΦTE, which can transduce chromosomal markers and carry a ToxIN plasmid. ΦTE was isolated from sewage effluent and was found to have an isometric head and tail morphology. It was shown to be resistant to phages ΦM1 and ΦAT1. The genome of ΦTE contained a repetitive DNA sequence that was expanded in escape mutants, which was found to be sufficient to inhibit Abi activity. This was shown through an in vitro assay where excess antitoxin RNA was provided to test whether it could inhibit ToxN activity. The expanded repeat was found to be composed of pseudoknots of ToxI RNA, which folded into an antitoxin structure that could inhibit ToxN. This expansion of the repeat was found to occur through strand slippage during replication. The paper concludes that ΦTE demonstrates a novel mechanism of escape from Abi through upregulation of an inactive antitoxin, which is selfishly provided by the phage. This may provide an example of "infectious altruism" and may help explain the horizontal transfer of Type III TA systems between phages. The study also showed that ΦTE can be used as a tool for functional genomics, as it had a low but similar transduction efficiency to other transducing phages. The findings suggest that the interaction between phages, ToxIN and phage resistance mechanisms is a complex system where selection favors escape mutants, but may also lead to the spread of the ToxIN plasmid.
The paper describes a new retroviral vector system that allows for quantitative measurement of cell-to-cell transmission of retroviruses in cell culture. The vectors are designed to measure reporter gene expression in infected cells only after virus particles are produced in the target cells, thus avoiding high background expression in effector cells. The system is used to study cell-to-cell transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV-1) in Jurkat cell-RajiCD4 cocultures. The results show that HIV infection in Jurkat-RajiCD4 cocultures is predominantly cell-free, while HTLV-1 transmission requires cell-cell contact and remodeling of the cytoskeleton. The HTLV-1 Tax protein is found to be a major determinant of the difference in transmission mechanisms between the two viruses. The authors conclude that the new vector system will help enable future studies of cell-to-cell transmission of retroviruses, particularly for HTLV-1.
The paper describes a genetic study of how zebrafish iridophores, a type of pigment cell, develop from neural crest cells. The study shows that iridophore development involves a complex network of genetic interactions and gene regulation. The authors identified a key positive feedback loop between the genes Tfec, Ltk and Sox10 that is required for maintenance of Tfec expression in iridoblasts, a stage of iridophore development. They used mathematical modeling to test different versions of this network and found that model A3, which included the repression of melanocyte fate by an unknown factor, best predicted the experimental gene expression data. They also showed that pnp4a expression is regulated by both Tfec and Mitfa, and is not a definitive marker of the iridophore lineage at early stages. The study highlights the importance of gene repression in cell fate specification and the need to identify the factor that represses melanocyte fate in iridophores. The authors propose that foxd3 is a candidate for this repressive factor, but further experiments are needed to confirm this. The study provides a framework for integrating the melanocyte and iridophore GRNs and identifying the mechanisms that repress melanocyte fate in iridophores.
The paper investigates how a plant resistance protein called RB recognizes and responds to a pathogen effector protein called IPI-O4. RB recognizes IPI-O1 which elicits resistance through its CC domain. However, IPI-O4 can also interact with the CC domain of RB and suppress resistance elicitation by preventing RB oligomerization. The authors found that IPI-O4 can interact with the RB CC domain in yeast and in plants, but not directly interact with IPI-O1. They identified four amino acids in IPI-O4 that are important for its interaction with the RB CC domain. They showed that mutating these amino acids in IPI-O4 can suppress resistance elicitation by RB. Their findings suggest a model where RB remains in a resting state without IPI-O1, but upon recognition of IPI-O1, it oligomerizes through its CC domain and activates signaling. However, when IPI-O4 is present, it interacts with the CC domain and prevents RB oligomerization, thus suppressing resistance elicitation. This interaction between RB and IPI-O4 was observed in multiple wild species of potato. The study demonstrates how a pathogen effector can co-evolve with a host resistance protein to overcome resistance, providing insights into designing new resistance genes that can continue to control disease.
This paper uses a combination of molecular dynamics simulations, molecular mechanics simulations, and protein stability analysis to investigate the mechanisms of activation of protein kinases. The authors analyze the conformational changes of the ABL and EGFR kinases that occur upon mutations that activate the kinase. They find that activating mutations tend to induce conformational changes in the in the inactive kinase form, which leads to a shift in the equilibrium towards the active kinase form. The authors propose a multi-stage activation mechanism involving cooperative transitions between different conformational states of the kinase domain. They also find that activating mutations tend to destabilize the inactive kinase form and enhance the stability of the active form. The results provide a molecular basis for understanding how activating mutations in protein kinases can lead to enhanced kinase activity and tumorigenesis. The study shows that activating mutations may exploit conserved structural features to accelerate a conformational transition and stabilize the active kinase form, leading to enhanced kinase activity. The study highlights the importance of understanding the conformational landscapes of protein kinases and how they are regulated in order to design cancer drugs targeting kinase activation.
This paper analyzes data from 12 African sites to assess the predictive value of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) white blood cell (WBC) counts at 6 and 12 months after treatment for second-stage African trypanosomiasis gambiense (HAT) to determine whether patients have relapsed or been cured. The authors found that the CSF WBC count at 6 months was significantly higher among patients who later relapsed compared to those who were cured, with a median count of 29.5 cells vs. 4 cells for patients who relapsed vs. 13 cells for patients who were cured. The difference increased at 12 and 18 months, but not at 6 months for patients receiving drug combinations. The authors found that the CSF WBC count at 6 months showed the best trade-off between sensitivity and specificity as a predictor of outcome, with a cut-off of 10 cells predicting relapse with 76.2% sensitivity and 80.4% specificity. They developed a two-step algorithm that classified patients as cured or relapsed at 6 and 12 months, which performed well and could potentially reduce the need for long follow-up. The study provides evidence that CSF WBC counts at 6 and 12 months can be used to predict the efficacy of HAT treatment in the field, with the two-step algorithm showing good performance.
This paper discusses how hypoxia can induce latent EBV infection to reactivate into lytic replication, which in turn contributes to EBV-associated tumorigenesis. The authors found that hypoxia-induced HIF-1α protein can activate the BZLF1 gene, leading to lytic EBV expression. They identified a specific HRE within the Zp gene that is activated by HIF-1α protein and not the other HIF-2α isoform. They showed that HIF-1α protein accumulates during epithelial and B-cell differentiation, which correlates with the stages when EBV infection reactivates. They identified a consensus HRE sequence within Zp that is activated by HIF-1α protein. They showed that HIF-1α-induced reactivation of EBV in cells is enhanced in hypoxic regions of tumors, which correlates with the distribution of Zta+ cells in tumor sections. They propose that HIF-1α-induced BZLF1 expression contributes to EBV tumorigenesis by activating cellular genes involved in angiogenesis and anaerobic metabolism in the tumor microenvironment. They propose that briefly targeting HIF-1α stabilizing drugs could be a useful strategy for EBV lytic-induction therapy, as long as the drugs are used in combination with other drugs that activate BZLF1 gene expression.
The paper presents a new approach to modeling the passive transmission of synaptic inputs across dendrites. The authors show that the voltage in dendrites attenuates faster than the radius changes, allowing for an approximation of the voltage profile using a 'slow' variable x and a 'fast' variable ε. This allows for a simple and accurate approximation of the voltage evolution in non-uniform dendritic structures. An optimal taper profile is found by maximizing the current transfer to the soma, which matches the results of numerical optimizations. The authors demonstrate that the optimal taper profile can be derived using variational calculus and maps well onto real dendritic morphologies across different cell classes. The authors show that the optimal taper profile favors transmitting synaptic currents towards the soma, with deviations along certain sections of dendrites that are functionally significant. The approach provides a new intuition for understanding dendritic function and the importance of a specific form of taper in maximizing current transfer. The paper highlights the importance of a quadratic taper profile for equalizing synaptic inputs across dendrites.
This paper describes a human challenge study that tested the efficacy of a new typhoid vaccine, M01H09, in preventing typhoid fever in healthy adult volunteers who were exposed to a challenge with Salmonella Typhi bacteria. The study found that neither a single dose of M01H09 nor three doses of a comparator vaccine, Ty21a, provided significant protection against typhoid fever after challenge. Despite this, both vaccines caused a reduction in the microbiological burden of infection and altered clinical disease profiles, with M01H09 showing a significant reduction in the attack rate when adjusted for baseline anti-Vi antibody levels. The study demonstrates the utility of a human challenge model for evaluating vaccine efficacy in a controlled setting, despite the limitations of using a relatively low dose of challenge bacteria and a short follow-up period. The findings suggest that anti-LPS antibody levels may not be sufficient alone to confer protection against typhoid infection, but that other immune responses are likely involved. The study highlights the importance of considering multiple immune responses, including mucosal and adaptive immunity, in addition to anti-LPS antibodies, in developing effective typhoid vaccines. The study also underscores the challenges of evaluating vaccine efficacy in a controlled model, particularly the impact of background exposure and antigen durability.
The paper discusses the results of a randomized controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of two different interventions for preventing malaria during pregnancy: insecticidal nets (LLINs) and intermittent preventive treatment with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP) vs. dihydroartemin-piperaquine (IPTp-DP). While IPTp-SP was found to be effective in reducing malaria during pregnancy, there was no significant difference in the incidence of malaria in infancy between children born to mothers who received IPTp-SP vs. those who received IPTp-DP. In fact, children born to mothers who received IPTp-DP had a higher incidence of malaria and parasitemia in infancy, especially among female children. The authors suggest that consistent exposure to dihydroartemin-piperazine during pregnancy may result in sex-specific differences in metabolism and pharmacokinetics, leading to lower levels of the antimalarial drug phosphate (PQ) in female infants. The results suggest that IPTp-DP may not be an effective intervention for reducing malaria risk in infancy. The study highlights the importance of further research into the biological mechanisms of in utero drug exposure and how it affects drug metabolism and dosing for malaria treatment and prevention.
The paper investigates the impact of drought on HIV infection in Lesotho, particularly among young women and girls. The study found that drought was associated with higher odds of selling sex, forced sex, and early sexual debut among young women in rural areas, as well as reduced educational attainment among girls. The association between drought and HIV infection was stronger among young women, particularly in rural areas where food shortages and income shocks were more pronounced. The results suggest that drought may exacerbate vulnerability among women, particularly through increased reliance on transactional sex work to cope with food insecurity. While the study had some limitations due to the ecological design and incomplete data, the findings highlight the need for targeted policies to mitigate the effects of drought on HIV transmission, particularly among young women. Interventions to reduce drought-related income shocks and improve resilience of crops could help protect vulnerable populations.
This paper presents a novel approach for comparing gene co-expression networks between two biological states, such as young and old mice. The approach focuses on comparing changes in gene co-expression relationships rather than just changes in gene expression levels. The authors generated gene expression networks for young and old mice using the AGEMAP dataset, and calculated the correlation between genes in each age group. They found that the correlation between genes decreased with age, indicating a loss of gene co-expression. They identified genes that showed a loss of correlation with age and analyzed the mechanisms that could account for this loss. They found that changes in transcription factor activity, chromatin structure, and gene expression levels were possible causes of the loss of co-expression. They also found that genes that showed a loss of correlation tended to be clustered together on the same chromosome. The approach could be applied to compare other biological networks and non-biological networks, and could be used to study changes in social or economic networks over time. The findings suggest that the loss of co-expression between genes is a hallmark of aging and may be due to changes in transcriptional machinery, tissue specificity, or chromatin structure. The approach provides a global view of gene expression changes during aging, complementing traditional differential expression analysis.
This paper analyzed the genome sequences of 21 Myxoma virus (MYXV) isolates from Scotland and England between 2008 and 2014, focusing on how they evolved and caused disease in laboratory rabbits. The study found that multiple lineages of MYXV have circulated in UK rabbits, with some viruses having different disease phenotypes. The researchers found that highly virulent and attenuated viruses were present in the field, but disruptions to major virulence genes were not necessarily associated with attenuation. The disease caused by these viruses was clinically distinct from the progenitor Lu strain, with alterations in tissue tropism and pathogenesis in acutely affected rabbits, demonstrating that the virus can explore many pathways to evolutionary success. They also found that the disease caused by some viruses was acute and resembled septic shock with mild signs of myxomatosis, while others had a nodular cutaneous or myxomatous phenotype. They conclude that changes in the genome of MYXV have caused changes in the pathogenesis of myxomatosis, with the emergence of different disease types depending on interactions between the virus and the rabbit genetics and environmental factors. The study highlights the complex evolution of virulence in large DNA viruses, with multiple epistatic mutations likely playing a role, and the role of genetic resistance in driving the evolution of the virus.
The paper discusses how plants regulate their growth in response to energy availability. The authors found that the low-energy activated bZIP1-related TFs, which are controlled by SnRK1 kinases, are involved in regulating auxin transport and root growth. They showed that bZIP1-related TFs, in particular bZIP1, bZIP2, bZIP4, and bZIP5, are required for root growth under energy-depleted conditions by repressing the expression of the auxin transporter PIN1 and the negative regulator IAA3SHY2. This results in impaired auxin transport and auxin-mediated root growth. The authors propose a model where bZIP1 expression is controlled by SnR1, which in turn represses PIN expression and PAT. The bZIP1-mediated repression of PIN expression is achieved through the recruitment of histone acetylation machinery. The authors also showed that bZIP1 expression is induced by SnR1 activity and repressed by sugars. The study highlights the importance of balancing energy input into growth processes to ensure plant fitness and survival.
The paper argues that the current WHO classification of dengue fever patients into non-severe and severe categories is not effective in identifying patients who require advanced level of care and predicting severe outcomes. The authors analyze a cohort of 35 laboratory-confirmed dengue patients in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, and find that the current classification misses 14% of patients who required level III care. They propose two new criteria to revise the severe dengue classification: acute decompensation of chronic disease and evidence of minor bleeding in association with thrombocytopenia <20,00 platelets/mm3. Adding these criteria improves the sensitivity of identifying patients who need level III care from 65% to 98%, and the sensitivity of predicting severe outcomes from 72% to 8%. The addition of these criteria also improves the specificity of the classification, with NPVs of 97% to 99%. The authors argue that the revised classification would help direct patient management and reduce morbidity and mortality by identifying patients who need advanced interventions, while avoiding unnecessary hospitalization during outbreaks. However, the study has limitations due to retrospective design and incomplete data, and the authors note that more research is needed to confirm the findings.
The paper describes a novel noncanonical BMP signaling pathway that regulates the accumulation of presynaptic pMad at active zones in Drosophila neurons. Pre-synaptic pMad is required for the accumulation of postsynaptic BMPR complexes and is mediated by Wit and Sax, which are expressed in motor neurons. The local pMad pool is not required for the transcriptional response to BMP signals, but is instead necessary for the stable accumulation of postsynaptic BMPR complexes. The local pMad pool depends on postsynaptic GluRIIA receptors and is sufficient to accumulate pMad at active zones. This noncanonical pathway does not contribute to NMJ growth and instead appears to set up a positive feedback loop where active GluRIIA receptors induce the accumulation of pMad at active zones, which in turn stabilizes the type-A receptors at synaptic sites. This positive feedback mechanism is thought to shape the synaptic composition for iGluRs as a function of type-A receptor activity. The authors propose that this novel pathway is triggered by glutamate receptors and is the first example of a BMP pathway triggered by selective neurotransmitter receptors and influencing receptor distribution at presynaptic sites. The findings suggest that some of these functions may also apply to mammalian glutamatergic synapses, where BMP signals may influence the activity of postsynaptic glutamate receptors by modulating their synaptic distribution and stability.
The paper describes how the bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes regulates its virulence genes in response to its intracellular environment. It finds that the bacterium has evolved a mechanism to control the production of branched-chain amino acids, which it uses as a signal to regulate its virulence genes. The bacterium has a global regulator CodY that represses its virulence genes under rich nutrient conditions. However, the paper finds that a second mechanism is needed under low nutrient conditions, which it identifies as the Rli60 gene. Rli60 is a ribosome-mediated attenuator that limits the production of branched-chain amino acids, allowing the bacterium to grow within the host. The study shows that this control of branched-chain amino acids is necessary for Listeria to function within the host and that Rli60 restricts the production of branched-chain amino acids, which in turn limits the activity of the global regulator CodY, allowing it to regulate virulence genes in response to the intracellular environment. The study suggests that the ability to sense and control nutrient availability is an important adaptation for Listeria to infect its host and that the regulation of branched-chain amino acids may be a key factor in Listeria pathogenesis.
This paper describes the draft genome sequence of the domestic turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) assembled from a combination of Roche 454 and Illumina GII sequencing data. The draft sequence covers approximately 93% of the turkey genome and was used to identify genetic variations, including single nucleotide polymorphisms, insertions/deletions, and gene conversions. The turkey genome was assembled using Celera Assembler 5.3 and compared to the chicken genome to identify regions of high and low nucleotide diversity, which are indicative of different evolutionary histories. The turkey genome was found to have a higher proportion of interspersed repeats compared to the chicken genome, which is consistent with a stable genome. The turkey genome was also compared to the zebra finch genome to identify genes involved in the innate immune system and show evidence of accelerated evolution. The turkey genome was found to have more genes involved in transcriptional regulation and less genes involved in protein turnover and cell proliferation compared to the chicken genome. The differences between the turkey and chicken genomes suggest that the turkey has undergone artificial selection for domestication, while the chicken has undergone more genetic variation. The turkey genome sequence provides a valuable resource for comparative genomics studies.
The paper discusses a mathematical model for understanding the assembly of triple-layered rotavirus VLPs. The authors developed a hierarchical assembly model based on Zlotnick's equilibrium framework to describe the assembly of the layers of subunits. They used the model to simulate the assembly of the innermost vp2 layer, vp6 layer and outer vp7 layer. They analyzed how the Gibbs free energy of subunit association affects the assembly efficiency. They found that assembly efficiency decreases as Gibbs free energy of subunit association increases, and that low Gibbs free energy favors assembly of intact particles. The model also showed that the optimal conditions for assembly occur when the protein concentrations are at or near the stoichiometric composition of the particles. The authors suggest that an equilibrium analysis of complex multi-layered VLPs could provide important insights into the feasibility of in vivo production systems.
This paper discusses the regulation of flagellar genes in the bacterium Xenorhabdus nematophila. The paper shows that the flagellar regulon, which is regulated by the FliZ protein, is expressed in a bimodal manner in X. nematophila, with some cells expressing flagellar genes at high levels and others at low levels. This bimodal expression leads to the establishment of cellular states where some cells express the FliZ regulon at high levels, while others express it at low levels. The authors propose that the amount of FliZ within each cell determines the fate of the cell, with cells with high levels of FliZ expressing the flagellar genes and producing flagella. The FliZ regulon regulates the expression of many non-flagellar genes, including hemolysin genes, which are important for virulence in insects. The bimodal expression of flagellar genes in X. nematophila may allow the generation of specialized cell types with different virulence potentials within a population of infecting bacteria. The paper demonstrates that FliZ plays a key role in flagellar regulation and is required for efficient flagellin expression, motility, and virulence in insects. The bimodal expression of flagellar genes may also contribute to the generation of specialized cell types with different virulence potentials within a population of infecting bacteria.
This paper presents a model that investigates how movement and conformity of individuals influence the emergence and stability of local cultural traditions in animal populations. The model describes the transmission of information between individuals and movement of individuals between spatially distinct subpopulations. The model introduces a new foraging problem that requires a solution, with two equally difficult and rewarding solutions. The model shows that conformity, which favors the most common solution, is key to the emergence of local traditions. The strength of conformity and the magnitude of movement relative to the learning rate determine the emerging patterns. The model can predict when local traditions are most likely to establish, and how the spatial configuration of subpopulations affects the outcome. The model was tested on a real-world example using the great tit population in Wytham Woods, with good agreement between the model and empirical diffusion curves. The results highlight the importance of both movement and conformity for local traditions, and demonstrate the generalizability of the model. The model can be extended to consider other factors like initial conditions, population size, age structure, and demography to make predictions for different species and populations.
The paper describes the isolation of a human IgG antibody (P1F12) from a patient with suspected Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) that was infected with Zika virus. The P1F12 antibody was found to bind specifically to Zika virus and not to any of the dengue virus serotypes tested, despite having no detectable somatic hypermutation (SHM). The P1F12 antibody was able to neutralize Zika virus at a concentration of approximately 2 μg/mL, indicating high neutralizing activity. The results suggest that germline-encoded antibodies can generate virus-neutralizing responses without extensive somatic hypermutation. The P1F12 antibody did not exhibit signs of extensive affinity enhancement, indicating that it likely arose directly from a germline precursor without undergoing affinity enhancement through somatic hypermutation. The results imply that germline-encoded antibodies may play a role in controlling Zika virus infection and may have potential as a diagnostic tool.
The paper investigates the use of molecular methods (qRT-PCR) to monitor Trypanosoma cruzi parasitemia in HIV-infected patients with or without Chagas disease reactivation. The study found that qRT-PCR was more sensitive and efficient than traditional parasitological tests (xenodiagnosis and blood culture) for detecting T. cruzi infection in HIV-infected patients, especially those with high levels of parasitemia. The highest levels of parasitemia were found in patients with reactivated Chagas disease, followed by coinfected patients and then chronic Chagas disease patients. The correlation between parasitemia and HIV viral load, CD4+ count and CD4+/CD8+ ratio in peripheral blood suggests that monitoring parasitemia levels could be used to determine when to initiate therapy in HIV-infected patients with immunosuppression. However, the low number of patients with Chagas disease reactivation limits the conclusions that can be drawn regarding the reactivation of the disease. The study proposes that prospective studies are needed to determine the factors that lead to reactivation in HIV-infected patients with low levels of parasitemia and the optimal timing of therapy. The results demonstrate the potential of qRT-PCR for monitoring parasitemia levels in Chagas disease patients, but further studies are needed to determine its utility as a criterion for initiating pre-emptive therapy.
The paper compares four different methods for detecting Trypanosoma brucei subgenus African trypanosomiasis infections using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). It evaluates the reliability of two metal ion indicator methods, calcein and hydroxynaphthol blue, and two DNA intercalating dyes, Quant-iT PicoGreen and SYBR Green, for endpoint detection. It finds that the hydroxynaphthol blue method is the easiest, most consistent and most reliable, with the highest inter-observer agreement. However, the agreement between the color change and gel electrophoresis results was variable and imperfect, indicating that more than one observer is needed for large-scale screening and monitoring. The violet to blue color change was also easier to see and more consistent, but not perfect. The calcein and MnCl2 method showed partial inhibition and difficulty distinguishing positive and negative controls. The study shows that hydroxynaphthol blue is the most promising method for low-cost, easy and reliable endpoint detection, but more work is needed to improve the consistency of color interpretation across multiple observers. The cost of the methods was also evaluated and hydroxynaphthol blue was found to be the most cost-effective. In summary, the study concludes that hydroxynaphthol blue is the best method for LAMP endpoint detection, but more work is needed to improve the consistency of color interpretation across multiple observers.
The paper describes a computational model of a cortical column that investigates what type of computation it might perform as a candidate model of cortical processing. The authors find that the model implements a subtractive mechanism that compares two input streams and expresses any differences in the mean activity of layer 5. This computation can be implemented via layer 5, which receives sensory inputs from the primary thalamus and projects to subcortical structures like the basal ganglia and colliculus. The authors suggest that this model could support theories of predictive coding, where cortical layers represent different stages of a hierarchical processing pipeline and the difference between expected and actual sensory inputs is calculated. The results suggest that layer 5 neurons perform a comparison operation that represents the error signal between reality and expectation, which may be relayed to subcortical structures like dopaminergic neurons. The paper demonstrates that the model's linear response to balanced inputs and nonlinear response to selective targeting of cell types could support this hypothesis. The findings provide evidence for the idea that cortical layers play different roles in different stages of a hierarchical processing pipeline, with layer 4 representing the internal model and layer 5 representing the output of a comparison operation. The study demonstrates how population density modeling can quickly explore the dynamical consequences of population level computational models.
The paper discusses the relationship between the dN/dS ratio and selection pressure in single populations versus divergent species. The dN/dS ratio is commonly used to detect positive and negative selection in protein-coding sequences, but the paper shows that this ratio is not a reliable indicator of selection pressure within a single population. The dN/dS ratio within a population is not a monotonic function of the selection coefficient, as it is when comparing divergent species. In fact, the dN/dS ratio within a population is less sensitive to changes in selection pressure and can even occur under both negative and positive selection. This means that inferences of selection based on the dN/dS ratio from a single population sample are problematic and may give misleading results. The paper also shows that the dN/dS ratio is less powerful at detecting positive selection within a population, especially when comparing samples from different time points. The paper highlights that the distinction between single and divergent populations is important when interpreting dN/dS values, as sequences from a single population may represent polymorphisms rather than fixed substitutions. The findings suggest that when analyzing dN/dS within a population, caution should be used when interpreting the results and more sophisticated methods may be needed to account for linkage disequilibrium and other complications.
The paper discusses the role of intrinsic MyD8 signals in CD8+ T cell responses during anti-fungal immunity. The authors found that intrinsic MyD8 signaling is required for the development and accumulation of Tc17 cells, but not Tc1 cells, after vaccination. Tc17 cells are indispensible for vaccine-induced immunity in CD4+ T cell deficient hosts. Intrinsic MyD8 signaling is necessary for the sustained proliferation of Tc17 cells, but not Tc1 cells. The authors identified a mechanism where MyD8 signaling through Akt and mTOR enhances Tc17 cell responses. They showed that intrinsic IL-1R and TLR2 signaling are required for Tc17 cell responses, while IL-1R signaling is dispensable. Intrinsic MyD8 signaling is essential for vaccine resistance in CD4+ T cell deficient hosts. The results highlight a potential target for augmenting adaptive immunity against pathogenic fungi, especially in individuals with CD4+ T cell defects.
The paper describes a method called MEX (Motif Extraction) to extract deterministic sequence motifs from protein enzyme sequences that can be used for functional classification. The method is based on an unsupervised motif extraction algorithm and applies it separately to each of the six main enzyme commission (EC) levels. This results in a large number of short peptides (SPs) that occur on enzyme sequences, but only a subset of which are specific to one EC level. The SPs are found to provide accurate functional classification of enzymes, with a coverage of 87-93%, depending on the level of EC hierarchy. The SPs are found to cover a majority of active sites and active binding sites, even when the enzymes have high sequence similarity. The method is compared to other classification methods and found to have higher coverage and accuracy, indicating that SPs are useful for enzyme classification. The paper demonstrates that the SPs can provide a concise and powerful tool for functional annotation of enzymes, even when enzymes have high sequence similarity. The SPs can be used as a complement to large-scale methods that rely on multiple sequence alignment and other computational models. The study lays the foundation for further experimental investigation of the SPs to understand their biological roles.
The paper presents a new mechanism for how the Wnt signaling pathway regulates gene expression during development in the nematode worm C. elegans. The authors found that cells that express Wnt ligands have higher levels of the downstream transcription factor β-catenin in their nuclei, which leads to quantitative differences in the expression of target genes. The authors identified 222 genes that require the transcription factor POP-1 for their expression, and found that genes expressed in posterior lineages with higher levels of β-catenin are more likely to depend on POP-1 for activation. This suggests that the transmitotic enrichment of β-catenin and POP-1 in response to Wnt signals represents a new mechanism for context-specific regulation of gene expression. The authors propose that the difference in β-catenin levels between cells with high and low expression of POP-1 leads to different activation and repression of target genes in different lineages. The results indicate that the Wnt pathway can contribute to context-specific regulation of gene expression by transmitting differences in β-catenin localization between cells, even in the absence of direct Wnt ligand expression. The mechanism may also contribute to the diversification of cell fates during development.
This paper describes a new model system for studying Plasmodium vivax, the less common malaria parasite that is often resistant to chloroquine. The authors used Plasmodium knowlesi, a closely related species that can be cultured in human red blood cells, to express genes from P. vivax and study their impact on drug sensitivity. They generated 14 constructs expressing P. vivax genes and found that most of the proteins were trafficked to the correct organelles, including the food vacuole, cytosol, and mitochondria, in a manner consistent with their known functions in Plasmodium falciparum. However, they were unable to test whether the genes were actually associated with drug resistance as the isolates used to generate the constructs had not been tested for drug sensitivity. The results suggest that expression of the P. vivax genes did not lead to increased drug resistance in the P. knowi parasites, possibly due to technical factors. The study demonstrates that Plasmodium knowi can be a useful model for studying P. vivax genes and proteins, but more work is needed to confirm the relationship between gene expression and drug resistance. The authors suggest that CRISPR/Cas9 technology could be used to directly insert P. vivax genes into the P. knowi genome to eliminate issues with expression from wild-type knowi genes and better investigate the role of these genes in drug resistance.
The paper assessed the burden of zoonotic diseases in Kyrgyzstan, a country in Central Asia, by using a disability-adjusted life year (DALY) approach to quantify the health loss. The authors analyzed data on the prevalence and incidence of 7 zoonotic diseases (anthrax, brucellosis, campylobacteriosis, congenital toxoplasmosis, non-typhoidal salmonellosis, rabies, echinococococcosis, and listeriosis) in Kyrgyzstan from 2013. They found that the majority of the burden came from anthrax, brucellosis, and non-typhoidal salmonellosis, with the majority of deaths due to premature mortality. However, the authors note that the data was limited and that the actual burden may be higher due to underreporting. They acknowledge that the estimates are conservative and based on assumptions, but provide an initial attempt to quantify the burden of these diseases. The authors suggest that more accurate data on incidence and aetiology is needed to improve the estimates. They also suggest that an integrated approach between human and veterinary health officials is important for disease intervention and prevention. The paper highlights the importance of considering the economic impact of zoonotic diseases in both humans and animals, and not just the direct health impact.
The paper discusses how immunodeficient mice lacking lymph nodes (LNs) or spleen (lymphoid tissues) can still develop immune responses after immunization through the skin or muscle. The authors show that splenectomized immunized mice lacking LNs can still mount T cell-driven autoimmune diseases like experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, which requires T cell activation from draining LNs. However, splenectomized mice lacking LNs do not mount high-affinity antibody responses. The authors also show that immunization in splenectomized mice can induce T cell priming in the liver, which then leads to T cell accumulation and autoimmune responses in the liver. They suggest that the liver can serve as an alternative site for T cell priming when draining LNs are not available. This finding has implications for understanding adaptive immunity and vaccination, and suggests that immune responses may not require dedicated lymphoid tissues.
This paper investigates how membrane fluctuations modulate the input-output behavior of stellate cells in the mouse entorhinal cortex. The authors find that while stellate cells exhibit some degree of fluctuation-mediated modulation of input-output responses, the modulation is relatively low compared to other types of neurons. They identify two factors that contribute to the limited modulation: (1) a nonlinear membrane resistance that increases with depolarization over a large sub-threshold voltage range and (2) a voltage-dependent slope conductance that activates over a significant sub- and peri-threshold voltage range. The authors use an exponential integrate-and-fire model to show that these factors influence the voltage trajectories leading up to spike threshold, which in turn affect the degree of fluctuation-mediated modulation. The model shows that a larger slope conductance generates a shallower voltage trajectory and a steeper slope-voltage relationship, reducing fluctuation-mediated modulation. The authors conclude that the limited modulation in stellate cells likely helps maintain stable firing patterns and spatial representations, and that the observed modulation mechanism is likely applicable to a wide range of neurons.
The paper discusses the role of the bacterial protein BacA in the symbiosis between Sinorhizobium meliloti and Medicago species. BacA is found to be essential for the survival of S. meliloti within nodules of these legume plants, where it protects the bacteria against the antimicrobial activity of nitrogen-fixing peptides produced by the plant. In vitro, BacA is shown to reduce the sensitivity of S. meliloti to these peptides, but in vivo it is not critical for the differentiation of bacteria into nitrogen-fixing bacteroids. Instead, BacA is required for the survival of S. meliloti within the plant symbiosomes. The paper proposes that BacA mediates this protection by limiting the damage caused by the peptides to the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane. However, the precise mechanism by which BacA limits peptide-induced membrane damage is not known. The authors also show that BacA complements the chronic infection of S. meliloti by B. abortus, a bacterium that also requires protection from host antimicrobial peptides. Overall, the study suggests that BacA plays a key role in enabling the establishment of chronic bacteria-host interactions by protecting bacteria from host antimicrobial peptides, and highlights the potential for studying different effects of peptides on bacteria within different symbioses.
The paper discusses how the bacteria Helicobacter pylori modulates its inflammatory response to maximize its ability to persist in the host. The bacteria has a type IV secretion system (T4SS) that is responsible for inducing inflammation and allowing it to colonize the stomach. The T4SS has five genes, cagPAI, cagY, cagA, cagB, cagX, cagV, cagW, and cagU, and cagM, which encode proteins involved in translocating CagA, a peptidoglycan, and other factors across the host cell membrane. The paper shows that H. pylori can undergo recombination in the cagY gene, which encodes the T4SS pilus, resulting in variants that have lost or gained function. These recombinations can occur in vivo and are associated with changes in the bacterial population. The paper proposes that the recombination in cagY acts as a "molecular switch" that modulates the inflammatory response by tuning the T4SS to maximize the bacteria's ability to persist in different hosts. The bacteria with lost function of the T4SS are less inflammatory and more likely to be selected for by the host, while bacteria with gain of function are more inflammatory and better able to colonize. The paper also shows that the cagY gene is a contingency locus that generates diversity at the population level and allows the bacteria to adapt to changing conditions.
This paper investigates the relationship between genomic features associated with translation efficiency and intrinsic noise in gene expression. The authors use a computational approach to decompose protein expression noise into a transcriptional component attributed to the presence of a TATA box, and a translational component attributed to high codon usage. They find that the amplification of noise strength that can be attributed to high codon usage is comparable to the amplification that can be attributed to the presence of a TATA box. This suggests that translation efficiency plays a significant role in noise amplification in protein expression, which is consistent with previous studies. However, the authors also find that the correlation between codon usage and noise differential varies between ribosomal and nonribosomal genes. Ribosomal genes tend to have lower noise differential, while nonribosomal genes have a higher noise differential. The authors suggest that optimization of codon usage for rapid expression may also involve other efficiency boosting features such as unstructured 5' UTRs, which is consistent with their results. The approach of decomposing noise into transcriptional and translational components provides a first estimate of the relative impact of these factors, but more experimental data would be needed to precisely factor in the contributions. Overall, the study demonstrates that translation efficiency plays a significant role in noise amplification and that genomic features associated with translation efficiency can be used to identify genes that are optimized for rapid expression.
This paper investigates the role of catalase in the fungal pathogen Candida albicans. The authors find that high basal levels of catalase expression in C. albicans promote resistance to oxidative and combinatorial stresses, but this comes at a cost of reduced fitness in the absence of stress. Specifically, high basal catalase expression increases the demand for iron, which is an essential but limiting micronutrient in the host. This fitness defect is observed in both in vitro and in vivo, and is mediated by the increased expression of genes involved in iron assimilation and homeostasis. In contrast to previous studies, the authors find that catalase overexpression does not compromise the virulence of C. albicans, at least in short-term infection models. They propose that this may be due to the fact that in these models, sufficient fungal doses are applied to overcome phagocytic clearance. In vivo, high basal catalase expression may not be required for virulence. The findings suggest that C. albicans has evolved to have low basal catalase expression to protect against host phagocytic killing while minimizing iron demand. The study provides insights into the impact of catalase levels on C. albicans pathogenicity and the tradeoffs between resistance to stress and virulence.
The paper examines the genetic diversity of Schistosoma japonicum, one of the five Schistosoma species that infect humans, in seven endemic municipalities in the Philippines. Using microsatellite markers, they found that there is ongoing gene flow among the S. japonicum populations from different areas, indicating movement of infected humans and animals between endemic sites. This is supported by the presence of migrant individuals and the lack of geographical structuring of the populations. High genetic diversity was found in municipalities with high prevalence of infections, which may indicate the presence of alleles that contribute to the parasite' infectivity. The study suggests that genetic variation among the parasite populations is important for their survival and resistance to drug treatment, and that monitoring genetic changes in response to mass drug administration (MDA) is necessary to improve control programs. The authors recommend using additional polymorphic microsatellite markers to analyze genetic diversity in S. japonicum and other Schistosoma species to better understand the impact of treatment and improve control measures.
The paper describes a case of hybrid necrosis in Arabidopsis thaliana where three different alleles at a conventional NLR resistance gene cluster (RPP7) and alleles at a complex, non-NLR resistance gene cluster (RPW8/HR) interact to trigger autoimmunity in the absence of pathogens. The study shows that variation in the number of C-terminal repeats and the short C-terminal tail of RP8/HR proteins predicts the degree of incompatibility between common RP8/HR alleles and corresponding RPP7-like alleles. The authors use chimeric plants to demonstrate that the C-terminal tail of RP8/HR proteins plays a regulatory role in modulating the autoimmune phenotype. They find that naturally occurring variation in the configuration of RP8/HR repeats and tails, rather than repeat number alone, is the main determinant of the severity of autoimmune symptoms when combined with RPP7-like alleles. The study suggests that RP8/HR proteins form similar pores as MLKL proteins and that the C-terminal tail regulates activity of RP8/HR proteins, providing a possible target for pathogen effectors. The findings provide evidence that certain pairs of loci are more likely to misbehave than others within the plant immune system. The study highlights the complexity of the plant immune system and how genes of different resistance clusters can interact in unexpected ways to confer broad-spectrum disease resistance.
The paper describes how the intracellular bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes adapts to the cytosolic niche of infected macrophages. The authors used a computational approach called integrative metabolic analysis (iMAT) to analyze the global metabolic state of L. monocytogenes during infection, predicting which metabolic pathways are active or inactive during intracellular growth. They found that four metabolic pathways - arginine biosynthesis, branched chain amino acid biosynthesis, glycerol utilization, purine biosynthesis and histidine biosynthesis - are specifically active during intracellular replication, while other pathways like fatty acid biosynthesis are inactive. They validated this prediction by generating gene deletion mutants of key genes in these pathways and observing that the mutants exhibit growth defects in macrophages. They also found that low concentrations of certain amino acids, specifically isoleucine, are required for the induction of virulence genes, which is linked to the activation of the transcriptional activator CodY. This suggests that L. monocytogenes modulates its metabolism in response to the cytosolic environment to optimize its intracellular growth and virulence. The study highlights the close relationship between bacterial metabolism and virulence, with intracellular carbon sources signaling the bacteria for their intracellular location and metabolic pathways being required for virulence.
This paper investigates the distribution and genetic diversity of Toxoplasma gondii strains in Senegal, West Africa. The study finds that there are four main clonal lineages of the parasite in Senegal: type II, type III, Africa 1, and Africa 4, with type II being the most common in coastal regions and Africa 1 being the most common inland. The authors suggest that the distribution of these lineages is influenced by the presence of invasive rodents like Mus musculus domesticus and Rattus rattus, which likely introduced type II and III lineages to Senegal through maritime trade. The Africa 4 lineage appears to have spread through terrestrial routes connecting Asia and Africa, while Africa 1 is thought to have an autochthonous origin in West Africa. The study finds that strains of Africa 1 are more virulent for mice and likely introduced to Senegal through terrestrial pathways, leading to its lower prevalence in coastal regions where Musculus domesticus is common. The authors conclude that the differences in virulence among T. gondii strains for different reservoir hosts may be an important factor in determining which strains persist in the environment and are available for human and animal infection.
The paper discusses the importance of monitoring drug efficacy and resistance to anthelmintic drugs used to control soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH) infections in humans. The authors propose a study to compare different diagnostic methods to assess drug efficacy, including egg counting methods like Kato-Katz smear and Mini-FLOTAC, and DNA-based methods like qPCR. The aim is to recommend diagnostic methods that can effectively monitor drug efficacy in resource-constrained settings, detect emergence of resistance at an early stage and provide cost-effective and accurate estimates of drug efficacy. The study will compare the performance of these methods for assessing egg reduction rate, which is the recommended method for monitoring drug efficacy. The FECPG2 platform, which allows for remote egg counting and automated analysis, is a new diagnostic method that could potentially provide a game-changing shift in how drug efficacy is monitored. The study will also assess the sensitivity of each method and provide proof-of-principle for qPCR to assess infection intensity and drug efficacy. The results are expected to provide insights into the use of SNPs in the β-tubulin gene as a marker for BZ resistance in human STHs. However, some challenges remain, including the possibility that observed trends in SNPs do not necessarily indicate resistance and the classification of individual response based on imperfect tests. The results will provide recommendations for the scientific community on the best diagnostic methods for monitoring drug efficacy in ongoing control programs.
The paper describes a randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating the effectiveness of the Respond to the First Fall to Prevent the Second (RESPOND) intervention in reducing falls in older people who presented to the emergency department (ED) with a fall. The RESPOND intervention aimed to provide personalized education and support to improve knowledge, self-efficacy and participation in evidence-based falls prevention activities. The RESPOND intervention included a face-to-face session and telephone-based coaching, using motivational interviewing and positive health messages. The results showed that RESPOND led to a significant reduction in falls but not fall injuries in older people presenting to the ED. However, there was no significant difference in hospital presentations, deaths or falls efficacy. The study highlights the challenges of conducting a trial in this setting, including high dropout rates and potential co-intervention bias. The results suggest that more intensive interventions may be needed to affect falls injuries and hospitalization outcomes. The RESPOND approach of providing telephone-delivered patient-centred care, motivational interviewing and positive health messages may be effective in reducing falls but further study is needed to determine if this is the case. The study also identifies the need to prioritize participants with frequent falls and address social support issues to improve outcomes.
This paper investigates the interaction between population dynamics and evolutionary dynamics in a social microbial species. The authors find that evolutionary changes in the frequency of a gene that enables cooperative growth can have a strong feedback effect on the population dynamics. The cooperators grow more slowly at low population densities and faster at high population densities, creating a density-dependent selective pressure that favors cooperators. However, the cheaters grow faster than cooperators at high population densities. This feedback loop can cause cheaters to proliferate at the expense of cooperators, potentially leading to the loss of cooperation. The authors demonstrate experimentally that populations that start at an eco-evolutionary equilibrium point will spiral to a new equilibrium point when invaded by cheaters, and that mixed populations with cheaters are less resilient than pure populations. The findings suggest that rapid environmental deterioration can be more harmful to mixed populations at eco-evolution equilibrium. The study highlights the importance of considering the interaction between evolutionary and population dynamics in understanding the emergence and maintenance of cooperative behaviors in microbial communities.
The paper describes the dynamics of immune responses in the red pulp of the spleen during Listeria monocytogenes infection using intravital microscopy. The authors show that CD1c+ cells in the subcapsular region of the red pulp capture Listeria within 2 minutes of injection and do not directly contribute to the innate control of bacterial growth beyond 48 hours. Macrophages (Mcs) converge on foci at 48 hours post infection and restrict blood flow around infected cells. CD8+ T cells are recruited to foci at 5 days post infection and make prolonged interactions with infected cells, but do not directly take up Listeria. Mcs within foci are primarily found in proximity to DCs. The authors demonstrate that Listeria association with DCs immediately after injection is consistent with CD1c+ cell depletion studies that show CD1c+ cells are required to capture Listeria in the spleen. The results suggest that scDC are phenotypically similar to DC found in other tissues and are a reservoir for Listeria, allowing Listeria to maintain foci. While DC are required to prime adaptive cells, they are not necessary for ongoing innate control of Listeria beyond 48-72 hours post infection. Antigen specific T cells in foci are arrested and resume migration after clearance of live bacteria, indicating that antigen presentation does not persist at the site of infection in the absence of live bacteria. The study shows that Listeria association with DCs and Mcs at foci is a complex relationship where DC may provide a niche for pathogen growth while mediating protection through recruitment of innate effectors and antigen presentation.
This paper examines the relationship between the diversity of reef fish assemblages and their ecosystem functioning, using a global survey of 6,142 reef locations. The authors found that the relationship between reef fish biomass and diversity is non-saturating, meaning that the impact of losing biodiversity on ecosystem functioning is greater than previously thought. They also found that human population density has a significant negative impact on reef biomass, particularly in more diverse reefs. They suggest that this is likely due to selective extinction of large species, which can have a rapid loss of ecosystem functioning. The authors argue that their findings challenge the current paradigm that biodiversity loss has a near-universal asymptotic relationship with ecosystem functioning and imply that the true impact of biodiversity loss may have been underestimated. They conclude that comprehensive reef governance at local, regional and global scales is necessary to maintain biodiversity and address the variety of drivers and stressors associated with coastal habitation.
This paper describes a new role of the transcription factor DAF-16 in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. The authors find that DAF-16 can both extend lifespan and induce germline hyperplasia and disruption of the gonadal basement membrane. They show that the lifespan extending effect of DAF-16 is balanced by its ability to induce germline hyperplasia and basement disruption. The authors find that mutations in the insulin/IGF signaling pathway that inhibit DAF-16 activity also extend lifespan, while mutations in the AGC kinases that activate DAF-16 promote germline hyperplasia and basement disruption. They propose that DAF-16 acts cell-nonautonomously to promote germline hyperplasia through the hypodermis. They also find that SHC-1, which inhibits DAF-16 activity, can antagonize DAF-16's effect on the germline basement membrane. The study suggests that DAF-16 has a complex role in regulating lifespan and germline function, with different aspects of its function affecting longevity and the germline in opposite ways.
This paper identifies a new protein complex called AP-5, which is a novel adaptor complex that mediates endosomal trafficking. The authors show that the AP-5 complex consists of two large subunits (μ5 and β5) and a medium subunit (C14orf108) that binds to a small subunit (DKFZp71E198). The complex was identified by searching databases for homologous sequences and performing yeast two-hybrid screens to identify interacting proteins. They found that C14orf108 binds to DKFZp71E18, which is homologous to the β-adaptin subunits of the other AP complexes. AP-5 depletion affects endosomal trafficking and accumulation of certain proteins in perinuclear regions. The authors propose that AP-5 functions as a late endosomal coat that facilitates vesicle budding from this compartment, although the exact site of action is unclear. The discovery of AP-5 highlights the evolutionary expendability of adaptor complexes, which have been lost from various organisms, and suggests that the specialization of different Golgi compartments may have contributed to the emergence of new adaptor complexes. The AP-5 complex represents a novel example of this expendability and provides a promising lead for investigating its function.
The paper proposes a method to integrate experimental data on the structure of a neural network with the activity of that network to constrain the structure and activity. The method uses a mean-field model of the network, which predicts the activity based on the connectivity and model parameters. The activity is then used to find a set of modifications to the model structure that can bring the activity closer to the desired level. The modifications are found by analyzing the sensitivity of the model's fixed points to changes in parameters, and focusing on the connections that determine the basin of attraction of the low-activity fixed point. The modified connections are then applied to the full spiking model to obtain realistic activity levels. The method is demonstrated on a multi-scale model of the vision-related areas of the macaque cortex, where it identifies critical connections between areas and leads to increased firing rates in the desired populations. The results show that the method can find a realistic activity level within the experimental uncertainties, indicating that the modified structure better captures the experimental data. The method provides a way to constrain the structure of a model based on experimental data, which can then be used to guide experiments to test the predictions.
The paper describes a comparative genomic study of Strongyloides stercoralis, a parasitic nematode that infects humans and dogs, using whole genome sequencing (WGA) of individual nematodes from Japan and Myanmar. The study aimed to determine intra-species genomic variations of S. stercoralis present in the two countries, which differ in socioeconomic status, history of infection and prevalence of the parasite. The WGA technique detected approximately 0.3 million variant positions, representing 0.6% of the genome, compared to the reference strain. The analysis showed that Japanese samples had higher heterozygosity compared to Myanmar samples, indicating that the Japanese samples likely had longer persistence of the parasite through auto-infection. The exceptions Rk9-1, Rk9-3 and Rk8-7, which had lower heterozygosity in sex chromosomes, likely arose through recent sexual crossing between closely related individuals. The results suggest that the frequency of sexual reproduction, which reduces heterozygosity, is an important factor in determining the number of heterozygous sites in the nematode genome. The study provides evidence that S. stercoralis has not been endemic in Japan for at least 50 years, as the Japanese samples had accumulated more heterozygous sites through auto-infection. The findings suggest that genome-wide analysis of heterozygosity can help infer the history of infections and prevalence of parasites in a specific area.
The paper presents a model-based approach to analyze age-related slowing in a continuous compensatory tracking task. The authors hypothesize that age-related impairment in sensorimotor systems is an adaptive response to increased endogenous noise, rather than a primary cause of impairment. They propose an optimal control model that fits the behavior of young and elderly subjects using parameters representing control cost, noise intensity, noise amplitude, and noise bandwidth. The model shows that elderly subjects employ simpler control strategies with reduced complexity, which results in slower response times but no increase in response latency. The results are consistent with the idea that elderly subjects adapt their motor control strategies to reduce the effects of increased noise. The modeling approach is able to quantify the extent to which subjects should use slower control strategies to reduce the effects of noise, and shows that elderly subjects use simpler control strategies. The results suggest that age-related slowing in this task is consistent with the hypothesis that it is an adaptive response to increased endogenous noise.
The paper proposes a model to estimate the spatio-temporal transmission patterns of dengue fever in Guangzhou, China based on available surveillance data and environmental, ecological, and demographic information. The model integrates the Ross-Macdonald theory with mathematical and computational models to simulate the transmission process and account for the spatial heterogeneity of mosquito densities and human mobility. The model estimates the quantities of adult mosquitoes and infection risk based on vector indices and environmental factors, and quantifies the transmission parameters. The results show that the spatio-temporal distribution of infections is highly heterogeneous, with urban areas having higher infection rates. The basic reproduction number, an indicator of infection risk, decreases from a peak in September to a trough in November, indicating the effectiveness of control measures. However, the actual infection rate still differs from the reported cases, suggesting that more effective interventions are needed. The approach provides insights into the dengue burden, transmission dynamics, and infection risk in Guangzhou that can inform public health planning.
This paper conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of 198 studies to identify factors associated with severe dengue shock syndrome (DSS), a life-threatening complication of dengue fever (DF). The study found that:   Female sex was a significant risk factor for DSS, with an odds ratio of 1.37 (95% CI: 1.17-1.60).   Neurological signs (restlessness, irritability, dizziness, stupor, coma, or convulsion) were associated with DSS.  Gastrointestinal bleeding was a strong predictor of DSS.  Hemotional signs (nausea and vomiting) were associated with DSS.  Abdominal pain was also associated with DSS.  Liver damage (ascites, hypoalbuminemia, pleural effusion, hepatomegaly) was strongly correlated with DSS.  Plasma leakage signs (hemoconcentration, pleural effusion, ascites, hypoalbuminemia) were highly correlated with DSS.  Blood platelet count was negatively associated with DSS.  Secondary infection was positively associated with DSS.  Dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) was associated with DSS in Thailand.  The study found a decreasing trend in the ratio of DSS to DF over time, likely due to improved clinical recognition and management.   The results suggest that the age of children was negatively correlated with DSS, while malnutrition was positively correlated with DSS.   However, the study had several limitations, including the difficulty in assessing the impact of primary/secondary infection, underlying diseases, and early treatment on DSS due to limited data.   In summary, the study identified 21 factors associated with DSS, which could help improve understanding of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of this complication.
The paper investigates the role of thalamic synchrony in the emergence of feature selectivity in primary visual cortex. The authors simulate cortical responses using a biophysically inspired integrate and fire model and measure the timing jitter in LGN inputs to determine the effect of synchrony on cortical orientation selectivity. They find that increasing synchrony leads to higher information transmission efficiency, but at the cost of increased firing rate. The optimal level of synchrony, around 10-20ms, is found to be the most efficient. This suggests that populations in the LGN are arranged to be synchronized in this range, allowing information transmission without sacrificing precision. The results demonstrate that synchrony plays a prominent role in shaping the feature selectivity of cortical neurons, but existing models of orientation selectivity have ignored this aspect. The findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the observed thalamic synchrony and cortical orientation selectivity.
This paper investigates the mechanism by which chemotactic signaling molecules are packaged and released from cells during chemotaxis. The authors find that chemotactic signaling molecules like LTB4 are packaged in membrane-bound vesicles called MVBs that are released as exosomes during chemotaxis. They show that LTB4 is present in both membrane-bound vesicles and exosomes, which contain enzymes required for its synthesis. The exosomes mediate the effects of LTB4 on neutrophils by sensitizing them to primary chemoattractants and acting as molecular beacons for other cells. They show that the release of exosomes is the primary mechanism by which LTB4 is released during chemotaxis and that exosomes are required for LTB4 signaling. They demonstrate that depletion of a key proteins involved in exosome release, Rab27a and sphingomyelinase 2, leads to defects in LTB4 signaling. Overall, the study provides insight into the mechanisms of how chemotactic signals are packaged and transmitted during neutrophil migration and contributes to our understanding of how neutrophils migrate in response to chemoattractants.
This paper investigates the role of the ZHP-4 protein in meiosis, specifically in the formation of chiasmata, or chromosome bivalents, during the transition from recombination intermediates to crossovers. The authors find that ZHP-4 is required in two stages: at mid-pachytene stages to promote the formation of an RH-1-mediated recombination intermediate, and at pachytene exit to convert the RH-1-marked recombination intermediates into chiasmata. They show that ZHP-4 is required for the formation of RH-1 foci at mid-pachytene stages and that the failure to do so leads to defects in recombination initiation and chromosome segregation. However, ZHP-4 mutants are still able to form genetic crossing over at late pachytene stages, but fail to produce chiasmata. The authors propose that the failure to form late RH-1 foci at designated crossover sites likely disrupts the remodelling that is required for chromosome segregation. They also show that ZHP-4 localizes to the synaptonemal complex at mid-pachytene stages and later to designated crossover foci at pachytene exit, indicating that ZHP-4 is required for the conversion of recombination intermediates into chiasmata. The paper highlights the distinction between the early role of ZHP-3 in the crossover pathway and the later role of ZHP-4 in stabilizing RH-1 at late pachytene stages.
The paper investigates the role of the Nlrp3 inflammasome in Francisella tularensis (Ft) infection in mice. The authors find that Nlrp3-deficient mice are resistant to lethal Ft infection, while mice lacking Casp1/1 or Aim2 are susceptible. Nlrp3-deficient mice have reduced levels of inflammatory cytokines, but still exhibit a protective neutrophil response, suggesting that Nlrp3 plays an inflammasome-independent role in promoting mortality. Nlrp3-deficient mice have reduced immature myeloid cells and fewer necrotic changes in the lungs compared to susceptible mice, indicating that Nlrp3-mediated death of myeloid cells and stromal cells contributes to lung damage. The authors conclude that Nlrp3 plays a host susceptibility factor role during Ft infection, independent of its role in the inflammasome, by preventing an early neutrophil response and promoting necrotic/necroptotic death of myeloid cells.
The paper investigates the evolutionary history of the IRGM gene family in nonhuman primates. The gene family consists of multiple copies in mice and other mammals but has been reduced to a single copy in humans and two copies in humans. Analysis of genomes of nonhuman primates shows that the gene has been pseudogenized in most species, except for humans and African great apes. The authors find that the human IRGM gene has a restored ORF, while other primates have a nonfunctional ORF. They propose two possible scenarios for the evolutionary history of the IRGM gene: either it was lost in humans 40 million years ago and then resurrected in the common ancestor of humans and apes, or it was lost in the primate ancestor and then pseudogenized in Old and New World monkeys. The data suggests that the gene has been undergoing structural changes over time, including the integration of an ERV element that altered expression and splicing in humans, consistent with the hypothesis of gene resurrection. The authors propose that the gene's dynamism and ability to undergo rapid evolutionary changes may be important for its function in modulating the autophagic response and resistance to intracellular pathogens.
The paper discusses the results of a prospective cohort study of Leishmania donovani (Visceral leishmaniasis) infection in HIV patients in Northwest Ethiopia. The study aimed to assess the long-term outcomes of visceral leishmaniasis patients with HIV co-infection, including relapse-free survival and risk factors for relapse or death. The study found that 50% of patients with a CD4 cell count below 20 cells/μL at the end of visceral leishiasis treatment achieved relapse-free survival at one year, compared to 43% of patients with a CD4 count above 20 cells/μL. However, the study had limitations in that the allocation of pentamidine secondary prophylaxis was dependent on CD4 count, which made it difficult to determine if the effect was due to the prophylaxis or the CD4 level. The study suggests that patients with a CD4 count below 20 cells/μL who received pentamidine had a higher relapse rate compared to those without, but there were still a significant number of relapses in both groups. The study recommends that secondary prophylaxis should be considered for patients with a CD4 count below 20 cells/μL after effective visceral leishias treatment, especially those with a history of previous visceral leishias treatment. However, the study highlights the need for more research to determine the optimal dosing and frequency of pentamidine and other prophylactic regimens to improve relapse-free survival for hard-to-treat patients.
The paper presents a method to identify loss of constraint on transcription factor binding sites (TBS) between closely related yeast species. The authors used a phylogenetic model to distinguish between conserved and semiconserved binding sites, where semiconserved sites have lost constraint on some lineages but maintained function. They found that 5-6% of TBS are semiconserved, and 1-2% of the semiconserved sites showed evidence of functional loss of constraint. They tested whether semiconserved sites affect gene expression by recreating the loss of three TBS and found that substitutions predicted to result in loss of function altered expression. The results suggest that binding site turnover may be common, but the frequency of semiconserved sites is difficult to estimate. The authors note that the assumptions of their model are questionable, and more comparative data would be needed to reliably identify functional divergence in regulatory sequences. The approach provides an efficient way to identify loss of constraint on putative binding sites, but has a high false positive rate. The results suggest that semiconserved binding sites may be low-energy sites that are not necessarily functional, but the true number of semiconserved sites could be higher. The paper highlights the challenge of distinguishing between functional divergence and non-functional divergence within regulatory sequences.
This paper describes a functional genomics approach to identify candidate effectors from the aphid species Myzus persicae that may function as aphid salivary proteins and perturb plant cellular processes. The authors used a combination of bioinformatic and functional assays to identify 46 candidate effectors from the aphid salivary gland ESTs. They found that three of the effectors, Mp10, Mp4, and MpC02, modulate host cell processes and affect aphid performance. Mp10 induced chlorosis and local cell death in Nicotiana benthamiana and suppressed the oxidative burst response to the bacterial elicitor flg2. The overexpression of Mp10 in plants reduced aphid fecundity, suggesting that it may be a genuine effector that interferes with plant immunity. The other two effectors, Mp4 and MpC02, enhanced aphid performance. The identification of these effectors provides new insights into the molecular basis of plant-aphid interactions and may lead to the development of novel strategies for controlling aphid infestations.
This paper presents an approach to analyze high-dimensional single-cell data to diagnose diseases. The approach uses cell averaging into "supercells" to smooth out cell-to-cell heterogeneity, and machine learning to determine the optimal combination of parameters needed to distinguish between disease phenotypes. The key insight is that the optimal combination of parameters inferred from overlapping distributions is different from the optimal boundary obtained from supercells, which has predictive power for phenotyping. The approach is demonstrated on two examples: distinguishing healthy individuals from patients with two non-infectious uveitides and diagnosing Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome. For the former, only one parameter (CD27) was needed to distinguish healthy from diseased cells, while for the latter, a combination of 12 nuclear shape measurements was sufficient. The number of cells needed to achieve a reliable diagnosis was found to be a function of the number of parameters measured, but not necessarily the number of measurements taken on each cell. The results provide a guideline for optimizing the number of cells needed in future disease assessments and high-throughput drug screenings of age-related diseases. The approach could be applied to emerging technologies that allow for multi-parameter single-cell measurements.
The paper describes the discovery that Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a bacterium that causes hospital-acquired infections and is a major pathogen in cystic fibrosis, has a Quorum sensing (QS) system that controls the production of virulence factors. The QS system is mediated by the LasI/R receptor complex, which recognizes a homoserine lactone autoinducer. The authors found that a second LuxI homolog, RhlI, is also involved in QS regulation, but it requires the presence of C4-HSL to function. However, they discovered that RhlI is not required for RhlR function in colony biofilms, suggesting an alternative ligand exists that can activate RhlR in its absence of C4-HSL. This ligand promotes the expression of RhlR-regulated genes in biofilms. This provides insight into how the LasI/R system can continue to regulate virulence factors in mutants that have lost the LasI gene, which is often observed in cystic fibrosis patients. The finding that RhlR is active in the absence of RhlI in animal models of infection suggests that targeting RhlR could be a promising approach to develop novel antimicrobials against P. aeruginosa.
The paper analyzed whole exome sequencing data from 174 individuals with atrial fibrillation (AF) and 943 without AF to assess the role of coding variation in the condition. The study found that coding variation, which includes missense and nonsense mutations, is unlikely to be the predominant mechanism underlying common forms of AF. While genome-wide association studies have identified genetic variants associated with AF, the current sample size and power were not sufficient to identify coding variants with allele frequencies as low as 1%. The findings suggest that noncoding variation, particularly those with larger effect sizes, and coding variation with smaller effect sizes, may contribute to AF pathogenesis. The lack of association between coding variants and AF implies that efforts to identify potential therapeutic targets through exome sequencing analyses will require much larger samples or populations enriched for large genetic effects. The study was predominantly of European ancestry and may not be generalizable to other ancestral groups. The study had limited power to detect rare coding variants, particularly those predicted to be damaging. The results suggest that future studies should integrate coding and noncoding variation, such as whole genome sequencing, to clarify the genetic contributions to AF.
The paper discusses how bacterial lipopeptides, which mimic bacterial cell wall components, can enhance the infection of the human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in different cell types. The lipopeptides, such as Pam3CSK4, bind directly to RSV and target cells, enhancing the efficiency of infection. The authors found that the lipopeptides that enhance RSV infection are structurally similar to bacterial TLR1/2 ligands, suggesting that interactions between lipopeptides and bacterial structures may mediate the enhancement. They showed that pre-incubation of RSV with lipopeptides before infection, rather than infection, resulted in the highest enhancement of in RSV infection. The lipopeptides did not block or influence post-binding steps of RSV infection, indicating that they directly or indirectly enhance infection. The lipopeptides also enhanced the infection of other viruses like HIV-1, HMPV, and MV, suggesting a general mechanism. However, the lipopeptides inhibited RSV infection in immortalized epithelial cell lines that highly express glycans, suggesting that the lipoptides interfere with RSV binding to glycans. The findings suggest that carriage of respiratory bacteria in the respiratory tract may facilitate binding of RSV to target cells and thus play a role in the pathogenesis of severe RSV bronchiolitis. The study suggests that lipopeptides could be considered as potential adjuvants for live-attenuated RSV vaccines.
The paper describes an experimental approach to better understand the regulatory logic of the human genome by knocking down transcription factors and measuring the impact on gene expression. The approach uses high-throughput transfection of siRNA to knockdown 59 transcription factors and 131 chromatin modifiers, measuring gene expression changes 72 hours after transfection. The results show that while many genes are differentially expressed following knockdown of a factor, only a small fraction of the bound genes are also differentially expressed. The binding of transcription factors to their target genes is also found to be associated with stronger binding motifs and greater distances from the transcription start site. The authors argue that their definition of functional binding, based on proximity to the transcription start site, is somewhat noisy and may underestimate the true functional interactions. They observe that many factors function as repressors as often as activators, and that the apparent contradictions between their biochemical characterization and their regulatory effects may be resolved by the fact that activators release regulatory regions when their concentration is reduced. The paper highlights some limitations of their approach and concludes that more experiments are needed to develop a more sophisticated understanding of functional transcription factor binding and gene regulation.
The paper describes a novel computational approach to detect conserved regions in the HIV genome. The approach uses a scale-free method to identify regions of nucleotide conservation without assuming a priori knowledge of the scale of conserved features. The method is applied gene-by-gene to identify conserved regions within each gene, and is shown to detect novel regions that were missed by previous methods. The authors identify eleven conserved regions within the HIV genome, some of which correspond to known functional features like splice sites and regulatory regions, but others remain unexplained. The conserved regions are analyzed structurally using RNAfold to identify novel stable structures that may represent potential drug targets. The authors propose that the identified conserved regions could be used to prime the folding algorithm to predict the locally conserved secondary structure, allowing the algorithm to identify shorter conserved regions that may not have been detected by previous methods. The approach is shown to detect conserved regions within the env and gag genes that correspond to known splicing-dependent structures, and the conserved regions within the tat gene that correspond to alternative splicing. The conserved regions within the env gene are shown to be associated with the A4/5 splice acceptor cluster and may stabilize the 5' cap of the env transcript. The approach is validated using A-subtype sequences and shows good performance. The authors caution that the method may miss short or non-contiguous conserved regions, especially in genes with low nucleic acid variability. The approach is an important step towards identifying novel drug targets in the HIV genome.
The paper investigates the roles of ROR and REV-ERB genes in regulating Bmal1 expression in the circadian clock. The authors use cell-based models to study the redundancy among ROR and REV-ERB genes in regulating Bmal1 expression. They find that while ROR genes are not required for Bmal1 rhythmicity, REV-ERB genes are necessary for Bmal1 rhythm. The REV-ERB genes play a more prominent role in regulating Bmal1 expression, but ROR genes can also contribute to the rhythm through activating Bmal1 transcription. The REV-ERB genes are required for Bmal1 rhythmic expression in peripheral tissues, while ROR genes are only required for maintaining the amplitude of Bmal1 expression. The authors suggest that the REV-ERB genes play a more prominent role in regulating local clock outputs, while the ROR genes contribute to the basic clock function. The interlocking loops between ROR and REV-ERB genes help regulate expression rhythms in peripheral tissues and contribute to circadian signal transduction. The results provide insights into the mechanisms of circadian clock regulation and how different genes are regulated in different tissues, and suggest that the core loop of PER/CRY genes is primarily responsible for maintaining basic clock function while the interlocking loops contribute to local output rhythms.
The paper investigated the antibody status of survivors and close contacts of individuals infected with the Ebola virus during the 2013-2016 outbreak in West Africa. They collected blood samples from survivors 15-32 months after recovery and close contacts 15-28 months after exposure to determine the presence of antibodies against the three major viral antigens (GP, NP, and VP40) and neutralizing antibodies. They found that 97% of survivors had measurable antibodies against at least one of the antigens, with 85% possessing antibodies against NP, 10.7% against VP40, and 2.3% against GP. In the close contact cohort, 67% were positive for antibodies against all three antigens, 75% against two, and 25.8% against one. While neutralizing antibodies were detected in 97% of survivors, 70% of close contacts had undetectable titers. The study suggests that the incidence of asymptomatic EBOV infections may be higher than previously estimated due to the limitations of serology studies, with 34% of close contacts testing positive for GP antibodies but only a majority having measurable neutralizing antibodies. These findings suggest that some individuals may have been exposed to EBOV but never developed symptoms, potentially contributing to the transmission dynamics of the outbreak. The study highlights the importance of studying asymptomatic cases to better understand the transmission dynamics of EBOV.
The paper proposes a method to identify the minimal circuitry generating specific oscillations in a layered cortical network. The authors first use mean-field theory and linear response theory to determine the stationary firing rates of the populations and then analyze the fluctuations around these rates using eigenvalue decomposition. They show that the eigenvalue trajectories of the effective connectivity matrix can be used to identify the anatomical connections that shape the population rate spectra and determine the high-frequency peak. The sensitivity measure is introduced to analyze the contributions of individual connections to the spectra. The method is applied to a microcircuit model, which reproduces experimental oscillations in the γ range and low-γ range. The sensitivity measure is used to identify the minimal circuit that generates the high-γ peak, revealing that the self-coupling of population 4I is crucial. The authors find that the connections within layer 4 and the feedback connection from layer 4 to layer 2/3 are important for the amplitude of the peak. The method can be used to engineer circuits with desired oscillatory behavior. The results demonstrate that the sensitivity measure can be used to identify relevant connections for generating specific oscillations and provide insights into the anatomical origin of phase-amplitude coupling. The findings provide a general framework for integrating anatomical and physiological data into more consistent models of cortical circuitry.
The paper investigates the role of different proteins in DNA recombination and repair in the bacterium Deinocococcus radiodicus radiodurans. The authors find that RecA-independent recombination between direct repeats occurs mainly through a DdrB-dependent single strand annealing (SSA) pathway. They show that DdrB protein plays a key role in RecA-independent recombination between direct repeats, leading to the occurrence of deletions, and substantially contributes to the induction of deletions in γ-irradiated recA+ bacteria. They find that the distance between the repeats does not affect the frequency of RecA-independent recombination, suggesting that the DdrB-dependent SSA pathway is the primary mechanism. The results suggest that DdrB-dependent SSA plays a major role in genome plasticity in D. radiodurans, enabling the bacterium to rapidly reconstitute an entire genome from hundreds of fragments after high dose radiation exposure. The study also finds that the absence of the DdrB protein disturbs DNA replication and increases genome instability, and that RecA-independent recombination between repeated sequences is influenced by the availability of single-stranded DNA on the lagging strand template. The findings support the idea that DdrB-dependent SSA plays an important role in DNA repair and genome reconstitution in D. radiodurans.
The paper investigates how the neural representation of space in the hippocampus and medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) is organized to encode spatial information. The traditional view assumes that the hippocampal place cells are sparse and the MEC grid cells are dense, but recent experiments show that MEC grid cells can also generate place cells independently of grid-field firing. The authors propose a model where MEC grid cells are connected to hippocampal place cells via feed-forward connections and the MEC grid cells generate place fields that are remapped to cover different environments. They find that a relatively small number of grid cells can encode multiple environments with a similar spatial resolution, but the place field quality (sparseness) deteriorates as more environments are encoded. This suggests that the hippocampal place cells are not sparse due to coding requirements but serve other purposes like energy efficiency and autoassociative memory. The results argue against a pure feed-forward model of place field formation from grid cells and support the idea that the grid and place representations are generated independently. The grid cells likely provide modulatory or stabilizing effects on place cell activity.
The paper presents a predictive model for predicting acute kidney injury (AKI) within 24 hours of onset in hospitalized patients. The model was developed using electronic health record (EHR) data from three hospitals and showed good predictability in predicting AKI, sustained AKI, requirement for renal replacement therapy, and mortality. The model uses time-varying laboratory values, such as changes in creatinine and potassium levels, as the primary predictors. Time-invariant demographics, like sex and race, were found to be weak predictors. The authors argue that the laboratory-based model has the potential to be implemented more easily into EHR systems than prior models and provide real-time alerts to providers. The model was able to identify predict AKI within 24 hours, which may be useful for preventing or changing the course of the disease. However, the authors acknowledge that the model does not provide causal explanations and that more work is needed to optimize the implementation and interventions.
This paper presents results from a retrospective study conducted in Ecuador to assess the impact of mass distribution of ivermectin on the prevalence of Strongyloides stercoralis, Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura and hookworm. The study looked at fecal and serological data collected before, during and after ivermectin distribution in areas where it was used and compared to areas where it was not distributed. The results showed that ivermectin mass distribution significantly reduced the prevalence of Strongyloides stercoralis, especially measured by serology, but not as much by fecal examination. The prevalence of Ascaris lumbricoides and hookworm was also reduced by ivermectin, especially in areas where it was distributed. The study found that ivermectin distribution had a long-term impact on the prevalence of Strongyloides stercoralis, six years after the last treatment, and that albendazole distribution may have contributed to the reduction of other soil-transmitted helminths. However, some individuals remained infected despite multiple ivermectin courses, suggesting that transmission persists in the area. The study highlights the potential of using ivermectin as part of preventive chemotherapy campaigns to control strongyloidiasis and the possibility of replacing albendazole-diethylcarbamazine regimens with ivermectin-albendazole combinations for lymphatic filariasis prevention. The study also suggests that ivermectin distribution could be used to control scabies. The limitations of the retrospective design, including differences in diagnostic methods and sampling, mean that the impact of ivermectin on other soil-transmitted helminths may be underestimated.
The paper describes the cryo-EM and cryo-ET structure of the spuma virus glycoprotein, which is the main structural protein of the virus responsible for budding and membrane fusion. The glycoprotein is composed of two subunits: Gag and Env. The authors found that the Env protein forms a hexagonal lattice on the surface of the virus, which is thought to be advantageous for host cell entry as it increases the avidity of the virus for host receptors. They also found that the glycoprotein is trimeric, with three transmembrane helices that interact with each other to form a hexagonal lattice. The Env trimer is composed of two subunits: gp80SU and gp48TM. The gp48TM trimer is in close proximity to interact with each other, which is important for fusion. The capsid is found to be surrounded by an intermediate shell of density, which is thought to be derived from the Gag N-terminal domain and the cytoplasmic domain of the gp18LP. The capsid at the center of the virus is surrounded by a second shell of density, which is likely derived from the Gag core and Env. The capsid at the center is found to be more uniform in size, indicating it is the mature form of the virus. The authors suggest that the capsid is a pseudo-symmetrical structure. They also found that the Env trimer has coiled coil regions, which are typical of class I fusion proteins. The study provides new insights into the structure of the glycoprotein and will help develop the virus as a gene therapy vector.
The paper proposes a crowd-sourced forecasting method called Epicast to predict influenza and chikungunya outbreaks. The method collects predictions from a large number of people and aggregates them to produce a forecast. The paper finds that Epicast performs relatively well compared to individual participants and statistical methods in predicting short-term outcomes, especially peak height and the number of weeks until the peak. However, it struggles with predicting long-term outcomes, as the peak is often delayed and the data is incomplete. The authors acknowledge the limitations of the human judgment approach, including that it requires a large number of participants, collecting and processing predictions is tedious, and that it is not robust to rare or atypical events. They propose combining human and statistical methods as a future direction to potentially improve forecast accuracy.
The paper proposes a new method to identify sets of genomic loci (PoCos) that collectively exhibit improved power in predicting a disease phenotype compared to individual loci. PoCos are identified by selecting genomic loci that cover a larger fraction of disease cases while minimally covering controls. The authors identify two types of PoCos: network-free PoCos and NetPocos that incorporate prior biological knowledge. They show that PoCos contain functionally related loci that are more robust and reproducible compared to individual loci. They demonstrate that PoCos improve risk assessment performance compared to using individual loci, especially when combined with functional information from protein-protein interaction and expression quantitative trait loci data. The authors also find that including functional data does not significantly improve prediction performance but still provides useful insights into disease mechanisms. The PoCos identified by the method contain genes related to the disease and provide potential new susceptibility genes. The proposed method is implemented in MATLAB and made publicly available.
This paper investigated the role of FAK (a non-receptor tyrosine kinase) in regulating RET/MAPK signalling in Drosophila. The authors found that FAK negatively regulates RET/MAPK signalling in the context of ectopic RET expression. When RET is constitutively activated, FAK is required to suppress the excessive activation of the MAPK pathway and prevent cell death. When FAK is absent or mutated, the MAPK pathway becomes hyper-activated and leads to ectopic differentiation and cell death. FAK inhibits RET/MAPK signalling by reducing the recycling of the EGFR receptor, which is normally located at the plasma membrane. The authors propose that FAK acts as a "fuse" that can buffer cells against potentially harmful tyrosine kinase-mediated oncogenic signaling by promoting internalization. The negative regulation of MAPK by FAK is evolutionarily conserved and has important consequences for cell and tissue fate. FAK's role in regulating RTK/MAPK signalling is context-dependent and not simply related to its role in integrin engagement. The authors also found that the negative regulation of MAPK by FAK is conserved in human breast cancer cells downstream of EGFR signalling.
The paper presents a fine-mapping study of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) locus, which is one of the most intensively studied regions in the vertebrate genome. The authors used a high-density SNP panel and long-range haplotype phasing approach to characterize the association of IgA deficiency (IgAD) with the HLA locus in four independent populations from Europe. They found that the strongest association was with the HLA-DQB*02 allele, which includes both the DQB*02 and DQB*02 alleles. Recombinant haplotypes carrying the DQB*02 allele showed no association with IgAD, while extended haplotypes containing the DQB*02 allele were associated with increased risk. The association was found to be due to the additive effect of two independent susceptibility alleles located on the HLA-B*08-DR103-DQB102 and HLA-DRB*07-DQB102 haplotypes. The paper also identified a protective effect associated with the HLA-DRB*15 allele. The associations were consistent across the three populations, despite population-specific differences in the distribution of the haplotypes. The results suggest that the causal variant is likely located in the telomeric end of the Class II region, most likely within the HLA Class III region. The study provides new insights into the genetic basis of IgAD and highlights the complexity of the association with the HLA locus, involving multiple loci and haplotypes. The approach used to compare recombinant and extended haplotypes allowed the authors to better characterize the individual haplotype background and their contribution to disease susceptibility.
This paper presents a study on how protein disorder affects protein structure and function. The authors used simulations to investigate the relationship between protein disorder, protein length, and the number of charges in a protein sequence. They found that protein disorder (IDP) has a power-law relationship with protein length and the number of charges in the sequence. This relationship was tested using experimental protein disorder data, which showed good agreement with the simulation results. The authors found that the simulation results were best when using experimental protein disorder data from Hilser et al. and a composite disorder data scale that combined Hilser, Kallenbach, and Creamer data. The experimental data showed that protein disorder was larger than random coil estimates, indicating that protein disorder has non-trivial preferences for structures. The simulation results also showed that charge effects on IDP were weakened by mixing positive and negative charges. The study suggests that molecular descriptions of protein disorder depend mostly on protein disorder propensities, but other intramolecular factors like electrostatic effects are also important. The study demonstrates the importance of understanding protein disorder for understanding protein structure and function.
The paper shows that immunization with certain salivary proteins from sand flies can have a profound effect on Leishmania infection. Immunization with the protein PpSP15 protects against Leishmania infection, while immunization with the protein PpSP4 exacerbates the infection. The mechanism is thought to be through the priming of a Th1 immune response, which is correlated with an increase in IFNγ producing CD4+ T cells. However, the amount of salivary protein injected by the sand fly during feeding is not enough to produce a protective response. Instead, the early induction of an immune response to the salivary protein by sand fly bites is sufficient to recall the same level of immunity. The results suggest that an adaptive immune response specific to a salivary protein is able to prime the anti-Leishmania immune response leading to protection or exacerbation of infection, depending on the protein. The findings emphasize the importance of identifying the molecules in saliva that are responsible for this effect and the role of salivary proteins in endemic areas.
This paper describes an in vitro circadian oscillator composed of the cyanobacterial proteins KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC. The authors used electron microscopy and crystallography to determine the structures of the proteins and analyze their interactions. They found that KaiB binds to KaiC in a rhythmic manner, and KaiC undergoes phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in a rhythmic manner. They propose a model that explains the oscillations of KaiC phosphorylation based on the interactions between KaiA and KaiB and KaiC, with KaiB binding KaiC when it is hyperphosphorylated. Monomer exchange between KaiC hexamers is observed, which helps maintain synchrony among the KaiC hexamers and sustain high amplitude oscillations. The model predicts that the KaiA•KaiC and KaiB•KaiC complexes are present at different phases of the oscillation, and the Class IV complex (KaiA•KaiB•KaiC) may be a mixture of the two. The authors also demonstrated that the oscillator can be reset by temperature pulses, which shows that the oscillator is temperature-compensated. The paper highlights the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms of the in vitro oscillator as a step towards understanding the circadian clock in vivo, and the potential for a purely post-translational clock in cyanobacteria.
The paper describes a randomized controlled trial comparing different frequencies and timing of school-based mass drug administration (MDA) of praziquantel to reduce schistosomiasis infection in Kenyan communities with moderate prevalence of infection among school-age children. The study found that both biennial and annual MDA resulted in significant reductions in prevalence and intensity of infection over 5 years, but annual MDA was slightly more effective. However, the study found that MDA alone was not sufficient to achieve the goals of schistosomiasis elimination as only half of the initial prevalence was reduced. The study suggests that MDA can help control morbidity but will need to be supplemented with other measures such as improved water and sanitation systems, snail control, and potential vaccination to achieve elimination. The study is the largest randomized trial comparing schistosomiasis MDA regimens to date and contributes to the evidence base for development of new guidelines. While the study had some limitations due to low sample sizes, it demonstrates that school-based MDA can be effective at reducing schistosomiasis prevalence in moderate-risk communities and may be a useful strategy for countries to consider.
This paper investigates how a parasitic infection of intracellular parasites, Toxoplasma gondii, modulates the migration of immune cells, specifically dendritic cells (DCs), in order to facilitate systemic dissemination. The authors find that Toxoplasma infection of DCs leads to a rapid hypermotile phenotype, which is dependent on the expression of the L-type voltage-gated calcium channel subunit Cav1.3. They show that Ca2+ signaling through Cav1.3 is required for the rapid migration of DCs, which is mediated by GABAergic signaling and membrane depolarization. The hypermotility of infected DCs is restored by addition of exogenous GABA, depolarization of the membrane, or inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels. The authors propose a model where initial invasion of DCs by Toxoplasma triggers GABAergic signaling, which leads to membrane depolarization and activation of Cav1.3, allowing for Ca2+ entry and downstream signaling pathways that induce cytoskeletal rearrangements and hypermotility. They find that silencing of Cav1.3 expression by RNA interference or selective inhibition of Cav1.3 with drugs abrogates the hypermotility of infected DCs, while baseline motility and morphology of DCs remain intact. This suggests that Cav1.3 is the main VDCC subtype involved in the hypermotility induced by Toxoplasma infection. The findings demonstrate for the first time that DCs express the L-type VDCC subunit Cav1.3 and that Ca2+ signaling via Cav1.3 is required for the hypermotility of DCs. The results provide evidence that Toxoplasma can manipulate host calcium signaling pathways to modulate immune cell migration and promote systemic dissemination.
This paper identifies a novel mechanism by which the filovirus matrix protein VP40 is regulated by the host protein BAG3. VP4 is essential for virus assembly and egress, but BAG3 interacts with the PxY motif of VP4 via its W domain to inhibit VP4-mediated budding and virus release. BAG3 binds VP4 and sequesters it away from the site of budding at the plasma membrane and into aggresomes, thus reducing virus egress and spread. This is the first host protein shown to negatively regulate VP4-mediated egress. BAG3 is a stress-induced co-chaperone that regulates protein homeostasis and is the first host protein to inhibit VP4-mediated budding. The mechanism involves sequestering VP4 away from the site of budding and accumulation in aggresomes. The results provide new insights into host-virus interactions and may inform the development of antiviral therapies targeting VP4.
The paper proposes a new theory for the role of the locus coeruleus (LMC) in the brain. The authors argue that the LC is not just a simple monitor of reward prediction error, but rather a driver of adaptive model updating and flexibility in behavioral responses. They propose that the LC is linked to the state-action prediction error, which is the difference between the agent's current model and the true model of the world. When the state-action prediction error is high, the LC responds with a temporary increase in activity, boosting the agent's ability to learn and adapt to changing environmental conditions. This activity is linked to the model decay parameter, which controls how quickly the agent forgets previous experiences. The authors simulate this effect using the Active Inference framework, a theory of behavior that models the agent's internal generative model as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). They show that the LC activity is able to reproduce many experimental observations of LC responses, such as phasic and tonic activity, and the link between LC activity and model decay. The key insight is that the LC responds to the outcome of the agent's decision-making process, rather than just reward prediction error. This allows the LC to modulate the agent's model updating and flexibility in real-time, enabling it to adapt to changing environmental conditions and respond to large prediction errors.
The paper discusses the frequency and function of circulating γT cells in hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in humans. The study found that γT cells are preserved in circulating frequency in both acute and chronic HBV infection, with CD3hiCD4- Vδ2+ γT cells as the predominant subset. However, γT cells in chronic HBV infection showed distinct innate-like phenotypes and functions compared to uninfected controls. γT cells from chronic HBV patients had increased expression of Tbet and Eomes markers, which correlated with their expression of NK markers. In contrast, γT cells from acute HB patients showed weaker IFNγ/TNF responses, which correlated with serum ALT levels. The study suggests that γT cells may participate in lymphoid stress surveillance during HBV infection and may have a role in protecting against liver inflammation and fibrosis. However, the lack of correlation between γT cell function and HBV DNA levels suggests that γT cells may not be fully activated to exert antiviral activity. The findings provide new insights into the role of γT cells in HBV pathogenesis and may have implications for immunotherapy against HBV.
This paper discusses the role of necroptosis, a highly pro-inflammatory form of cell death, in the pathogenesis of severe pneumonia caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylocococcus aureus (MRSA) USA30. The authors found that multiple staphylococcal toxins, including Hla, LukAB, and PSMs, induce necroptosis in immune cells in the lung, leading to excessive inflammation and tissue damage. Specifically, Hla induces MLKL phosphorylation and macrophage death, which contributes to lung pathology. Loss of alveolar macrophages through necroptosis, which are critical immune cells in controlling inflammation, amplifies the consequences of infection. The authors demonstrated that macrophage necroptosis is a key factor in the protection of mice from MRSA USA30 infection, as depletion of macrophages led to increased inflammation and tissue damage. The activation of necroptosis by staphylocin-mediated toxins likely provides a final common pathway that could be targeted to prevent S. aureus-induced lung damage. The results suggest that necroptosis is a shared consequence of staphylocin toxins, and the susceptibility of specific immune cells in the lung to individual toxins and hence to necroptosis further amplifies their destructive effects in vivo. The signaling components of the necroptosis cascade may provide a potential therapeutic target to prevent S. aureus-induced lung damage.
The paper discusses how developmental dynamics of a trait, in this case plant height, can be related to the final plant height, fitness, and yield. The authors used function-valued trait (FVT) modeling to estimate continuous growth curves of plant height and found that parameters describing growth curves were correlated with plant height, fitness, and yield. They then used QTL mapping, MR/WGCNA co-expression analyses, and eQTL mapping to identify genetic architecture underlying the FVT parameters. They found that QTL mapping and MR/WGCNA approaches were effective at explaining variation in FVT parameters, but that eQTL mapping identified genes that likely regulate the FVT phenotypes, with a higher proportion of cis-QTL and colocalization with FVT QTL. The eQTL results suggest pleiotropic gene regulation and that expression traits are likely components of the molecular regulatory mechanisms mediating the generation of FVT phenotypic variation. The study demonstrates the importance of examining developmental dynamics in an agroecologically relevant field setting and highlights the importance of combining multiple approaches to identify candidate genes with cis-QTL.
The paper describes a computational study of ligand migration paths in the enzyme Vanilly alcohol oxidase (VAO). The authors used protein energy landscape exploration (PELE) simulations to identify three migration paths for ligands entering and exiting the enzyme's active site: a cap path, a FAD path, and a subunit interface path. The cap path is the only path identified for small phenolic ligands and requires large side chain movements of residues, while the FAD path and subunit interface path require only small movements. The subunit interface path is conserved in closely related enzymes EUGO and PCM, suggesting that VAO dimerization may be linked to ligand migration. The re path identified for dioxygen and hydrogen peroxide is the shortest path to the solvent and involves residue Tyr51, which could assist in reduced flavin oxidation. The study identifies a novel substrate migration channel through the subunit interface and an additional co-substrate migration path, providing insight into VAO's mechanism and how it differs from related enzymes. The findings shed light on the role of specific residues in the migration paths and suggest that VAO dimerization may be linked to ligand migration. The study highlights the potential of computational methods for mechanistic enzyme study and the conservation of migration paths in related enzymes.
The paper proposes a new algorithm called ConvexCluster for performing convex clustering on large genomic datasets. ConvexCluster is designed to address the limitations of hierarchical clustering in handling large datasets and noisy data. ConvexCluster uses a proximal distance algorithm that minimizes a penalty function to find the optimal number of clusters. The penalty function accommodates prior knowledge by incorporating weights that encode the importance of similarities between observations. The algorithm also supports sparse weights and can handle missing data. The paper demonstrates that ConvexCluster is more robust to noise and can deliver more interpretable solutions than hierarchical clustering, especially when applied to large datasets. While hierarchical clustering is fast and visually appealing, ConvexCluster's ability to reliably deliver an entire solution path makes it a promising tool for exploratory analysis of large genomic datasets.
This paper discusses the results of a retrospective analysis of 68 patients diagnosed with neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) at a tropical medicine referral unit in Madrid, Spain over a 19 year period. The study found that NTDs were more common among immigrants than travelers and VFRs, with the majority of cases occurring in immigrants from Central Africa, West Africa and South America. NTDs occurred more frequently in immigrants, followed by VFRs and then other travelers. The most common NTDs were ascariasis, schistosomiasis, onchocerciasis and leishmaniasis. NTD polyparasitism (co-infection with two or more NTDs) was most common amongst immigrants, followed by VFRs and then other travelers. The study suggests that NTDs are not restricted to the tropics and may be diagnosed in countries of the developed world in travelers, immigrants and VFRs. However, the authors note that the sample size was limited by under-representation of patients from Asia, Oceania and North America, and some patients were lost to follow-up. The study highlights the emerging issue of imported NTDs and their potential impact on the epidemiology of these diseases in non-endemic areas. The authors argue that health professionals should consider protocols for screening and prevention of NTDs in their everyday practice and pre-travel advice for travelers, especially VFRs, to prevent secondary transmission and control NTDs in non-endemic areas.
This paper presents evidence that both MutSα and MutSβ proteins, which recognize mismatches during DNA replication, track with the replisome during DNA replication. The study employed chromatin immunoprecipitation and DNA tiling arrays to show that the MutSα protein is associated with the replisome during S phase, and that the MutSβ protein is also associated with the replisome, but in a less efficient manner. The study found that the MutSα protein is in excess of MutSβ protein levels, and that both proteins are required for repairing single base substitutions, single base indels and larger indels during DNA replication. The authors propose a model where MutSα and MutSβ associate with the replisome to cover the full spectrum of mismatches generated during replication, with MutSα possibly loading first and MutSβ loading independently of the replisome. They also show that the MutSβ protein persists in newly replicated regions after the leading strand polymerase has cleared the region, suggesting that it interacts with PCNA molecules that remain behind the replisome. The study provides evidence that both MutSα and MutSβ are associated with the replisome during DNA replication and are needed for efficient repair.
The paper discusses the structure and function of the pseudokinase protein STRADα, which lacks intrinsic kinase activity but can still activate the LKB1 tumor suppressor protein. STRADα interacts with the MO25α protein through multiple interfaces, including a conserved WEF binding pocket and a concave surface on the MO25α molecule. The authors found that binding of ATP to STRADα enhances its interaction with MO25α, which in turn enhances its affinity for ATP and ability to activate LKB1. They also found that mutations in the WEF pocket of MO25α that prevent ATP binding do not affect LKB1 activation, while mutations that prevent ATP binding to STRADα prevent LKB1 activation. These results suggest that the closed "active-like" conformation of STRADα, maintained through ATP binding, is required for its ability to activate LKB1. The structure of STRADα and the interactions with MO25α provide a model for how pseudokines may function by adopting a conformational state rather than catalytic activity.
The paper proposes a new method called single-cell probabilistic trait locus mapping (scPTL) that can identify genetic variants that modify the statistical properties of single-cell traits, but do not necessarily affect their mean values. The method can complement traditional quantitative genetics approaches that focus on identifying genetic variants that affect the mean or variance of cellular traits. The authors develop a novel genome-scan method that exploits the power of single-cell measurements by quantifying the distribution of single-cell traits at the cell population level and searching for genetic linkage at the cell population level. The scPTL method identifies genetic variants that modify the probabilistic properties of single-cell traits, such as cell-to-cell variability, without necessarily affecting the mean or variance of the trait. The authors demonstrate the feasibility and potential of the scPTL approach by applying it to a yeast dataset where they identified a genetic locus that modulates the variance of expression of a protein in response to galactose stimulation, which was not detected by traditional quantitative trait linkage mapping methods. The paper also discusses challenges and future directions for the scPTL method, such as how to estimate the proportion of variance explained by scPTL and how to map scPTL affecting multiple cellular traits simultaneously. Overall, the scPTL approach has the potential to identify small-effect genetic variants that underlie incomplete trait penetrance at the multicellular scale.
The paper discusses the discovery of a new mechanism by which the protein WDR23 regulates the activity of the transcription factor NRF2, which is involved in cellular stress response pathways. The authors find that WDR23, a protein related to KEAP1, negatively regulates NRF2 levels through the ubiquitin proteasome system. They show that WDR23 is able to interact with NRF2 and reduce its levels, and that this regulation is specific to NRF2 and not other transcription factors. They find that WDR23 mutations are present in some cancers and that overexpression of WDR23 can reduce the resistance of cancer cells to chemotherapy drugs. The authors propose that mutations in WDR23 could be useful for developing new therapies to enhance the regulation of NRF2 in cancer cells where KEAP1 is lost, which could help treat cancers that are resistant to chemotherapy due to high levels of NRF2 activity. The paper highlights the complexity of the regulation of NRF2 and the potential for WDR23 to play a role in cancer treatment.
The paper describes a study that used high-resolution digital photographs of irises to quantify eye color into two dimensions: hue (H) and saturation (S). They found that H and S correlated highly (r = 0.7), likely due to biological reasons. They identified 17 predictors that explained 48.8% and 56.3% of the variance in the quantitative eye color trait, including age and sex, 1 SNPs from 9 genes, and 4 SNP-SNP interactions. The predictors showed significant effects on both H and S. They identified 3 new genetic loci that were not previously known to be involved in eye color, which were located on chromosomes 1q21 and 1q42. The association signals at 1q42 were not replicated in TwinsUK and BTNS studies, likely due to small effect size and photo quality. The authors conclude that using quantitative eye color information can improve the power of genetic association studies and identify new genetic variants involved in human pigmentation. Their quantitative prediction model explained 49-56% of the eye color trait variance, which is the highest accuracy achieved so far. They propose using quantitative eye color prediction for for for forensic applications to trace unknown individuals based on eye color, as categorical eye color is prone to subjective and may have inter-individual differences.
The paper discusses a field-based approach to evaluate the role of animal odors in enhancing mosquito trap catches for Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) vectors. The researchers trapped mosquitoes in two ecologically distinct areas in Kenya and added sheep skin odors to the standard CO2-baited CD light trap. The results showed that traps baited with sheep odors caught more mosquitoes, especially those that are known to feed on sheep, compared to traps without odors. The effect was most pronounced for the primary and secondary RVFV vectors. The results suggest that host odors from sheep, in combination with CO2, can enhance mosquito trap catches. However, the study had limitations in that the animal odors used in the traps were not standardized and the mosquito species caught may have varied in their responses. The findings indicate that identifying and understanding the specific components of the skin odors that contribute to attraction is important for developing an effective monitoring tool.
The paper describes a cross-sectional survey of 1908 people in remote communities in the Western Province of the Solomon Islands to assess the prevalence of scabies and impetigo, a parasitic skin infections caused by Sarcoptes scabiei and Streptococococcus, respectively. The survey found that 19.2% of participants had scabies and 87.4% had impetigo, with higher prevalence among children and infants. The authors note that scabies was associated with a higher risk of impetigo, but there was no consistent association with household crowding. The study highlights the high prevalence of scabies and impetigo in the region, particularly among children, and suggests that community-based control of scabies could be an effective method to reduce the burden of impetigo and its complications. The study has limitations due to low participation and inability to conduct full clinical examinations, but the findings suggest that scabies control programs could be useful in reducing the prevalence and impact of impetigo in the Solomon Islands.
This paper presents the results of a large-scale serological survey of leptospirosis in Thailand, conducted between 2010 and 2015. The survey gathered serum samples from buffaloes, cattle, and pigs and humans in all 5 regions of Thailand, as well as from 7,28 livestock samples. The survey aimed to determine the predominant leptospira serovars circulating between humans and livestock in the epidemiological context of Thailand, identify spatial distributions of leptospira serovar seroprevalence in each region, and species, assess the similarity between predominant serovars across and within species and regions, and provide insights into host-serovar associations. The survey found that the most common infecting serovars were serovar Shermani, Ranarum, Sejroe and Tarassovi in all species, with serovar Shermani being the most common in humans. Seroprevalence was highest in the southern region, lowest in the north. Multiple serovar association was observed in cattle and buffalo. The survey suggests that livestock, particularly buffalo and cattle, may be an important source of infection for humans, and the results highlight the potential for transmission of leptospires between humans and livestock through contact with infected animals or contaminated animal products. However, the survey's results should be interpreted with caution as the samples were collected from passive surveillance and may not represent the entire population. Further studies are recommended to better understand the epidemiology of leptospirosis in Thailand, including animal density, movement and environmental factors.
This paper proposes Bayesian models to analyze mosquito populations from mosquito recapture (MR) experiments. The models can estimate mosquito abundance, survivorship and recruitment rates from MR data. The models are based on existing methods used for MR analysis, but account for the limitations of MR experiments, such as low capture efficiency and recapture rates. The authors show that their Bayesian models can tolerate low capture efficiencies and can provide estimates of recruitment rates even with low pupal counts. The models are applied to analyze data from an MR experiment in Rio de Janeiro to estimate the abundance, survivorship and recruitment of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. The results indicate that the models can provide useful estimates of recruitment rates, but may underestimate abundance if the number of released mosquitoes is low. The models suggest that pupal counts can provide useful information on recruitment rates but are sensitive to the extent of pupal collection. The paper highlights the potential of using Bayesian models to improve vector control strategies by estimating recruitment rates and vectorial capacity.
The paper discusses the mechanisms of nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) of mRNAs with premature termination codons (PTCs) in human cells. The authors propose a unified model for NMD in human cells, which suggests that the balance between NMD-antagonizing and NMD-stimulating factors determines whether a termination event is considered normal or premature. The Upf complex is the central NMD factor, which interacts with translation factors to trigger NMD. The paper presents evidence that 3' UTR introns are neither necessary nor sufficient for NMD in human cells. Instead, cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) antagonizes NMD by preventing the interaction of the Upf complex with translation factors. The authors suggest that a proximal PABP is dominant over 3' UTR exon-exon junctions, although introns may still antagonize NMD in some cases. The paper also suggests that some mRNAs have evolved mechanisms to evade NMD, such as inserting a premature termination codon downstream of a splicing event. The findings are consistent with the idea that the NMD pathway is conserved between mammals and other eukaryotes, but differences exist between yeast and mammalian cells in terms of when NMD occurs. The paper raises questions about how cytoplasmic PABP antagonizes NMD and how specific mRNAs evade NMD, suggesting future studies are needed to understand these mechanisms.
The paper discusses how concentration gradients can be used to determine positional information within a biological system. The authors show that for a gradient with a single source, to achieve precise positional information, the concentration must be averaged over time. They find that for subcellular gradients, even with only a few hundred copies of the protein, a minute of averaging can achieve high precision (e.g. ± 1% of cell length). For systems with a few thousand copies, longer averaging times (e.g. hours) are required. They also show that a two-gradient system, where both gradients are produced at both ends, can achieve greater precision by comparing the concentration at a threshold position and averaging over time. However, intrinsic noise in the gradients places a limit on the precision that can be achieved, and for developmental biology systems with longer effective lifetimes and non-steady state gradients, more complex mechanisms may be required. The authors conclude that while concentration gradients can provide a high level of precision, they require adequate copy numbers and time-averaging to achieve reliable positional information.
This paper discusses the results of a study in Haiti that found evidence of Lymphatic Filariasis transmission in areas previously identified as having low prevalence of the disease, suggesting that current mapping strategies may not be capturing all transmission foci. The study found that living within 20 meters of an index or autochonous index case increased the likelihood of being antigen-positive, indicating that microfoci of transmission are present. The study suggests that areas with low prevalence may still have transmission risk and that active surveillance may be needed to detect and address such foci. The paper notes that while the study had limitations in terms of sample size and the use of an inaccurate diagnostic test, the findings provide evidence that areas with low prevalence may still have transmission occurring and highlights the need for more sensitive diagnostic tools to detect infection. The study concludes that with more comprehensive programs and monitoring, transmission foci may be addressed and elimination of the disease may be achieved.
The paper discusses how different policy objectives (limiting morbidity and mortality, limiting the peak prevalence of serious disease, minimizing the impact on society and economy) may conflict with each other during a pandemic outbreak. The authors use a mathematical model of influenza transmission to evaluate the impact of interventions aimed at different objectives. They find that an intervention starting in the early stages of the epidemic, while still reducing the peak prevalence and incidence, is not always the most cost-effective option. In fact, starting a little later may be a better policy if the intervention is strong enough to prevent a resurgence of the epidemic. The model shows that even low levels of vaccine coverage can reduce the required intervention level. The authors argue that more detailed economic cost functions and data on the costs of interventions are needed to guide policy decisions. The paper highlights that the complexity of including socio-economic factors into models is more important than increasing the complexity of modeling infectious disease transmission.
The paper examines the genetic diversity and population structure of two mosquito species, Aedes mcintoshi and Aedes ochraceus, which are known to transmit Rift Valley fever virus in Kenya. The study finds that Ae. mcintoshi consists of at least four distinct clades, while Ae. ochraceus clusters within two clades, with some samples showing substructure between samples from Kenya and Senegal. The clades are associated with different RVF outbreak patterns in Kenya, with samples from RVF epidemic areas forming a distinct clade. The authors propose that the genetic structure of Ae. mcintoshi may be related to environmental factors, while the expansion of Ae. ochraceus in Kenya may have contributed to its increased ability to transmit the virus, leading to more frequent outbreaks. The study highlights the importance of comprehensive genetic characterization of these mosquito species and regular monitoring to develop strategies for controlling them.
This paper presents an analysis of the transcriptional response to Notch signaling in Drosophila cells. The authors used a short pulse of EDTA to activate Notch activity and monitored gene expression over a 150 minute time course. They found that genes responded in different ways based on when they were activated, with some upregulated within 10 minutes and others taking longer to respond. They identified clusters of genes that showed similar response profiles, including early upregulation and delayed upregulation. They found that early responding E(spl)bHL genes may feed forward to enable the expression of later responding genes by reducing repression. They propose that hairy repression by early targets is a key mechanism for delayed upregulation. They also found that Pol II binding and Su(H) binding were not sufficient to predict the response of genes, suggesting that other mechanisms are involved. This model could explain why mutations in E(spl) genes phenocopy Notch knockdown and why some genes are only partially upregulated by hairy knockdown. The study highlights the importance of analyzing transcriptional responses to understand regulatory mechanisms and demonstrates the potential for feedforward repression in the Notch pathway.
This paper investigates how the adaptation of primate lentiviruses to new hosts requires the acquisition of both species-specific inhibitors and the ability to optimally use key factors critical for virus replication. The authors find that most HIV-1 Env proteins have reduced ability to use macaque CD4 compared to human CD4, and that adaptation of HIV-1 Env proteins in macaques can improve this ability. They identify a single amino-acid change, A281T/V, within the CD4 binding site that enables HIV-1 Env proteins to use macaque CD4 and replicate more efficiently in macaque cells. This change, A281T/V, occurs repeatedly during HIV-1 Env adaptation in macaques and does not have major effects on Env neutralization properties. The authors propose that residue 281 in the CD4 binding site is a determinant of the narrow tropism exhibited by HIV-1 Env. Introduction of the A281V mutation into HIV-1 Env proteins can improve their ability to use macaque CD4 without changing overall Env conformation or neutralization properties. The findings suggest a blueprint for manipulating HIV-1 Env proteins in a highly targeted way to generate SHIVs that can accurately represent HIV-1 strains circulating in humans as models for testing Env-directed prophylactic and therapeutic interventions.
The paper discusses the function of the protein Rok in the bacterium Bacillus subtilis. Rok is a negative regulator of genes involved in horizontal gene transfer, and is similar to the nucleoid-associated protein H-NS from Gram-negative bacteria. Rok binds to A+T-rich DNA and represses genes acquired by horizontal gene transfer. The protein has a C-terminal DNA binding domain that is responsible for its DNA binding activity. Rok binds to genes and regions of the chromosome that are known or thought to have been acquired by horizontal gene transfer and are characterized by high A+T content. It helps keep the integrative and conjugative element ICEBs1 quiescent by inhibiting spontaneous excision. Rok also represses the expression of some genes directly or indirectly. The paper finds that Rok binds preferentially to A+T-rich regions of the chromosome and helps to silence foreign DNA with a high A+T content. The authors propose that Rok is functionally analogous to H-NS from Gram-negative bacteria and Lsr2 from Mycobacterium and related high-G+C actinomycetes, and suggest that other organisms likely have similar proteins that are not readily recognized by sequence similarity. The paper concludes that Rok is a key regulator of horizontal gene transfer in B. subtilis and helps to maintain the stability of the genome by repressing genes and elements acquired by horizontal gene transfer.
The paper discusses the role of the histone demethylase KDM6A in regulating the expression of the Rhox6 and Rhox9 homeobox genes, which are involved in reproduction. The authors find that KDM6A specifically binds to and demethylates the promoters of these genes in female ES cells, leading to increased expression compared to male cells. They show that this increased expression is due to the sex-specific binding of KDM6A in female cells, which removes the repressive histone mark H3K27me3 and enables the genes to be expressed. They find that KDM6A is also bound to these genes in the ovary, where they are highly expressed. The authors conclude that KDM6A plays a critical role in regulating the expression of Rhox6 and Rhox9 in a sex-specific manner, with female cells showing higher expression due to their escape from X inactivation. They propose that the sex-specific binding of KDM6A may be favorable for Rhox6 and 9 expression in the ovary, where it keeps these genes active. The paper provides evidence that KDM6A is a sex-specific regulator of Rhox6 and 9 expression, highlighting a previously unappreciated mechanism of gene regulation.
This paper describes the discovery of the mechanism of mating-type switching in the yeast species Ogataea polymorpha. The authors used a combination of genetic, transcriptomic and biochemical approaches to identify genes involved in the pathway that regulates mating-type switching in this species. They found that the transcription factor EFG1 is required for nitrogen-dependent switching and upstream of the pathway, and acts as an activator of the transcription factor RME1. The transcription factor RME1 is required for switching, and is activated by the transcription factor STE12, which is induced by nitrogen depletion. Overexpression of either EFG1 or STE2 is sufficient to induce switching. The authors propose a model where EFG1 represses RME1 in the presence of nitrogen, and in its absence, RME1 activates switching. The final steps in switching involve homologous recombination, but the intermediate steps remain unknown. The authors also found that genes involved in mating-type switching have distinct transcription profiles compared to genes involved in the mating response, indicating that the two processes are regulated by different pathways. The paper highlights the complexity of the pathways involved in switching between mating types in different species of yeast, and how different species have reorganized their networks to decide how to respond to nutrient status and pheromone signals.
The paper investigates the dissociation of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) capsids upon nuclear import. HBV capsids are composed of 240-180 core proteins and are encapsulated with the viral DNA. The authors used digiton-permeabilized cells to study the intracellular fate of HBV capsids. They found that HBV capsids dissociate into core protein dimers upon nuclear import, which then reassemble into mature capsids. This dissociation and reassembly occurs inside the nucleus, not outside the cell. The core protein dimers are likely derived from dissociated capsids. The core protein dimers then reassemble into capsids, which are then released into the cytoplasm. The authors propose that the nuclear pore complex is the likely compartment where capsid disintegration occurs. This dissociation of capsids into core protein dimers likely occurs before capsid entry into the cytoplasm. The paper provides evidence that capsids dissociate into core protein dimers followed by rapid RNA-dependent reassembly to capsids, which is misdirected in the absence of RNA. The time at which the polymerase-RNA complex interacts with the capsid subassemblies is likely important for efficient assembly. The findings suggest that the cytoplasm and nucleus support the assembly reaction, with the nucleus providing the environment for disintegration and the cytoplasm providing the environment for reassembly.
This paper describes the identification and characterization of the C. elegans gene ATF-7 as a transcription factor that regulates the innate immune response downstream of the p38 MAPK pathway. The authors used genetic screens to identify ATF-7 as a key downstream target of the p38 MAPK pathway in C. elegans. They found that mutations in the ATF-7 gene resulted in increased susceptibility to pathogens and a diminished expression of p38 MAPK-regulated genes, suggesting that ATF-7 functions as a negative regulator of the p38 MAPK pathway. ATF-7 was shown to physically interact with activated p38 MAPK and undergo phosphorylation by p38 MAPK, leading to a switch in activity from a transcriptional repressor to an activator that facilitates p38 MAPK-regulated gene expression. The authors propose that the regulation of ATF-7 by p38 MAPK represents a conserved mechanism by which p38 MAP modulates the activity of ATF2/ATF7 family bZIP transcription factors in innate immunity, which has been retained even after the loss of Toll-like receptor signaling. The study provides insights into the molecular mechanisms of p38 MAPK-mediated regulation of ATF2/ATF7 in innate immunity and highlights the importance of the p38 MAP-ATF7 pathway as a major pathway of C. elegans innate immunity.
The paper investigates the role of FOXO3 in regulating the clonal expansion and memory CD8 T cell responses to a viral infection. The authors find that FOXO3 deficiency leads to increased clonal expansion of CD8 T cells during the primary response, but does not affect their phenotype or function. The expanded CD8 T cells are maintained for extended periods without compromising their quality. The enhanced CD8 T cell memory is mainly observed in the spleen, where FOXO3 deficiency leads to reduced cellular apoptosis and increased accumulation of memory CD8 T cells. The authors propose that FOXO3 regulates the magnitude of CD8 T cell memory by T cell intrinsic mechanisms, including promoting apoptosis of proliferating cells. The findings suggest that modulation of FOXO3 activity during the expansion phase might be a fruitful strategy to boost vaccine-induced CD8 T cell memory and protective immunity.
The paper discusses the challenges of estimating transmission investment in malaria parasites, particularly in in the Plasmodium chaba parasite species. The current methods for estimating transmission investment are shown to be limited and produce biased results due to the blurring together of synchronized cohorts of parasites. The authors propose an alternative approach that uses a time series model to account for the carryover of gametocytes from previous asexual stages. The method uses effective propagation numbers to estimate the growth of parasites within each individual host and can handle autocorrelated errors in gametocyte counts. By fitting the model to simulated time series data, the authors demonstrate that their approach can accurately estimate transmission investment and reveal variable patterns of transmission across different hosts, even when inoculated with the same parasite strain. The authors apply their method to real data from mice infected with Plasmodium chaba and find highly variable transmission investment patterns across different hosts, suggesting that estimating transmission investment is a more complex problem than previously appreciated.
This paper studies the role of the JNK signaling pathway in the morphogenesis of the Drosophila embryo during dorsal closure (DC). The authors identify 164 genes that are up-regulated in embryos with increased JNK activity. They show that these genes are differentially expressed along the anterior-posterior axis and within the epidermal layers, with different patterns of expression in the lateral ectoderm and dorsal ectoderm. They find that HOX genes like Abd-A and Abd-B regulate the expression of some of these JNK target genes, and that loss of HOX genes leads to delays in segment closure. The authors propose that the HOX genes work together with JNK signaling to generate a complex transcriptional response that allows for proper DC. They use in situ hybridization and quantitative analysis to show that scaf, a JNK target gene, is specifically regulated by both HOX genes and JNK activity, exhibiting a complex expression pattern along the anterior-posterior axis. They also find that HOX genes are required for proper timing of closure of segments during DC. Overall, the study highlights the importance of the interplay between JNK signaling, HOX genes, and segmental information for proper tissue morphogenesis during dorsal closure.
This paper investigates the role of a protein called sortilin in the progression of prion disease. Sortilin is a member of the VPS10P sorting receptor family and is known to regulate the accumulation of prion protein (PrP) and prion protein scrapie (PrPSc). The study shows that sortilin plays an inhibitory role in the pathogenesis of prion disease by sorting PrP to the late endosome/lysosome pathway for degradation. However, PrPSc accumulation can also stimulate sortilin degradation in lysosomes, leading to a decrease in sortilin levels. This decrease in sortilin function allows PrP to accumulate more easily on the cell surface, leading to further PrPSc accumulation. The study also shows that sortilin is reduced in prion-infected cells and mice brains, which further accelerates the sortilin-mediated degradation of PrPSc. This suggests that sortilin-mediated lysosomal degradation of PrPSc could be a potential therapeutic approach for prion diseases. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of PrPSc accumulation and the role of sortilin in prion disease.
The paper describes a study on how the bacteria Brucella melitensis, a chronic bacterial pathogen, induces the unfolded protein response (UPR) in macrophages. The study found that Brucella infection activates all three branches of the UPR: IRE1, PERK and ATF6, leading to the upregulation of UPR target genes like BiP, CHOP and ERdj4. The UPR induction appears to be mediated by the bacterial surface protein TcpB, which causes ER fragmentation and disruption. The UPR supports Brucella intracellular replication by providing amino acid transport, lipid synthesis, autophagy, protein folding capacity and stress resistance. The UPR also enables the host cells to cope with ER stress. The study found that TcpB mutants, which have reduced virulence, have reduced UPR induction and ER fragmentation, suggesting that the UPR is required for Brucella replication. The results suggest that the UPR plays an active role in supporting Brucella replication and may provide a new avenue for drug development against the bacteria.
The paper presents the results of a study on the distribution and abundance of Trypanosoma brucei gambien, the vector, and the human population in the mangrove focus of Boffa in Guinea. The study found that while T. b. gambien is actively transmitted to humans in the mangrove, it has not been found in the tsetse flies sampled, suggesting that T. b. gambien is transmitted through human-to-human contact rather than through the tset flies themselves. The tset flies themselves have low infection rates, with only 0.1% of them infected with T. b. gambien. However, the study found that many humans are seropositive to T. bambien, indicating that they have been infected by an infective tset. This suggests that vector control targeting tset flies is unlikely to eliminate T. bambien transmission. Instead, an integrated strategy of medical surveillance and vector control targeting humans would be more effective to reduce tset/human contact and protect people from infective bites. The study recommends vector control targeting humans as an additional intervention to complement current case detection and treatment strategies.
The paper discusses the challenges faced by the Community-Directed Treatment with Ivermectin (CDTI) approach in controlling Onchocerciasis in Cameroon. The CDTI approach involves communities selecting and motivating Community Distributors (CDDs) to distribute Ivermectin. However, the study found that communities were not fully sensitized and informed of their roles and responsibilities in the process, leading to low adherence to treatment. Communities were not involved in planning, resource mobilization and monitoring of the process. This was due to a top-down approach to planning, lack of adequate health worker capacity at frontline health facilities, inadequate training of CDDs and CSM facilitators, and inability to conduct distributions during rainy seasons. The study highlights the importance of community participation, sensitization and training of CDDs and CSM facilitators to improve the CDTI process. It also suggests that integration of CDTI with other health interventions may dilute the concept. The paper concludes that better community participation, sensitization and training are needed to improve the CDTI approach in order to achieve the goal of controlling Onchocercias.
The paper describes the development and validation of a new real-time RT-PCR assay for the detection of rabies virus that overcomes some limitations of previous assays. The new assay targets a conserved region of the N gene and uses degenerate primers and probes to detect lyssaviruses from all major phylogenetic groups. The assay was validated using a diverse panel of representative lyssavirus isolates and was able to detect all major RABV variants. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay was found to be superior to conventional RT-PCR and DFA, even with samples of poor quality. The high sensitivity of the assay makes it suitable for detecting low levels of rabies RNA in ante-mortem samples and samples stored under suboptimal conditions. The real-time RT-PCR assay has the potential to improve rabies surveillance and diagnostics, especially in resource-limited areas where current methods are difficult to implement, by reducing logistical burdens and allowing for faster and more accurate testing. The authors expect that the LN34 assay will improve rabies diagnostic capacities in many laboratories around the world.
The paper describes an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) to identify epigenetic variations that could contribute to the development of type 1 diabetes (T1D). The study used monozygotic twins (MZ) and longitudinally sampled pre-T1D singletons to rule out genetic differences and establish the temporal origins of T1D-associated epigenetic variations. The authors found 58 T1D-Methylation variables (T1D-MVPs) that were hypermethylated (hyperT1D-MVPs) and 74 that were hypomethylated (hypoT1D-MVPs) in the T1D-affected twins, compared to their genetically identical monozygotic twins. The T1D-MVPs were confirmed using pyrosequencing and Illumina27K array analysis. The T1D-MVPs were found to precede clinical diagnosis and were stable over several years. The study demonstrates that T1D-MVPs can be identified in individuals before they show autoantibodies, suggesting that they may be causative rather than just a result of the autoimmune process. The results provide a blueprint for future EWASs of other complex diseases by demonstrating the importance of disentangling epigenetic effects from genetic and environmental influences. The study highlights the need to investigate the temporal origins of T1D-MVPs, define the boundaries of associated genomic regions, study their functional effects, and determine if they are biomarkers or causative.
The paper describes the structure and function of the fusion protein HAP2, which is involved in the fusion of gametes in flowering plants. HAP2 has been identified in multiple organisms, including Arabidopsis thaliana, Trypanosoma cruzi, and other eukaryotes. The authors found that HAP2 has evolved multiple modes of membrane interaction, with the Arabidopsis form having a single fusion loop that inserts into the lipid bilayer, while the T. cruzi form has three loops. They crystallized and structurally characterized HAP2 from both organisms and found that the core structure of the protein is conserved, but the membrane interaction surface is different. They showed that HAP2 inserts into membranes via nonpolar residues at the domain II tip and that are essential for function. They also found that the amphipathic helix at the domain II tip of the Arabidopsis form is required for membrane insertion. They showed that HAP2 can insert into artificial liposomes and that mutations of nonpolar residues in the helix affect membrane insertion. They propose that the high conservation of the core structure and the amphipathic helix at the domain II tip indicate that HAP2 evolved from a common ancestral form. The paper provides evidence that HAP2 has evolved multiple modes of membrane interaction, which may be related to the different lipid compositions of the target membranes in different organisms.
The paper discusses how the transverse filament protein Zip1 in budding yeast regulates interhomolog crossovers during meiosis. The study found that Zip1's first 20 residues are required for both its ability to promote MutSγ crossovers and assemble the synapsis-deficient SC. Zip1's residues 2-14 are dispensable for its capacity to promote Ecm1 SUMOylation, but regulate the extent of Ecm1 SUMOylation. Zip1's N terminal residues 15-20 appear to control Ecm1 SUMOylation through an interaction with Zip3. Zip1's residues 15-20 are required for Zip1's capacity to recruit Zip3 to DSB sites and centromeres. Zip1 mutants lacking residues 2-14 exhibit SC assembly but severely diminished MutSγ crossovers, while Zip3 is barely detectable on SC structures. Zip3 localizes more strongly on Zip1 structures when Zip1 residues 2-14 are missing. The study proposes that Zip1's N terminal residues 15-20 interface with a factor(s) involved in SC assembly, perhaps Zip3, to coordinate SC assembly with crossover recombination events. Zip1's N terminal region also appears to regulate Zip3's localization to DSB sites and SC structures. The study suggests that Zip1's N terminal region plays a key role in coordinating crossover recombination and SC assembly, but the exact mechanism of this interaction remains unclear.
The paper discusses a computational model of auditory processing that aims to understand how the auditory cortex represents sounds based on the statistical properties of the sounds. The model uses a non-linear and non-negative approach called Maximal Causes Analysis (MCA) that can handle hundreds of components to represent cochleagrams (representations of sound waveforms) in a more natural way than standard sparse coding models. The model shows that inhibitory subfields of the estimated STRFs (spectro-temporal receptive fields) can directly emerge from the assumptions of the statistical model itself, without any additional assumptions about explaining away effects. This suggests that inhibitory subfields can be a direct consequence of probabilistic inference and learning, rather than a property of the neural network. The authors argue that this provides evidence that probabilistic inference and learning may play a key role in how the auditory cortex represents sounds, and could lead to new tools for evaluating assumptions underlying probabilistic inference in the auditory cortex and beyond. The paper compares the MCA model to standard sparse coding models, showing that MCA can capture more realistic properties of the STRFs, such as frequency tuning widths and temporal tuning. The authors also find that inhibitory subfields emerge more naturally in MCA than in standard sparse coding models.
The paper investigated whether spatial and non-spatial information processed in the hippocampus are processed in separate subnetworks or integrated. The authors found that distal CA1 is more sensitive to retrieving temporal information while proximal CA1 and CA3 are more tuned to spatial information. This suggests that the spatial and non-spatial information subnetworks are segregated along the proximodist axis of the hippocampus. However, when both dimensions are salient, the subnetworks are not necessarily segregated. The authors also found that temporal information bound to objects engages distal CA1 more than proximal CA1, while spatial information bound to objects recruits the same part of the "spatial" subnetwork as spatial information bound to locations. This suggests that the traditional view of spatial and non-spatial information being integrated at the level of the hippocampus may be compatible with the idea of separate subnetworks for spatial and non-spatial information processing within the hippocampus. The study suggests that the integration of spatial and non-spatial information may rely on the same mechanism(s) but the number of dimensions of the memory retrieved may differ.
The paper describes a new method for measuring the rapid kinetics of outer membrane vesicle (OMV) entry into host cells. The method uses a genetically encoded fluorescent reporter probe that is targeted to the OMV surface and a cell-permeable dye that is cleaved upon OMV uptake, allowing for real-time monitoring of entry kinetics. The authors tested this method on OMVs from different E. coli serotypes and pathovars and found that the presence of the OMV antigen on the surface accelerates OMV entry into host cells, while OMVs lacking antigen rely more on clathrin-mediated endocytosis. They also found that different uptake pathways are used for OMVs with and without antigen, and that the length of the antigen may impact the maximum entry rate. The study demonstrates the ability to capture the rapid kinetics of OMV entry and cargo release in a sensitive and dynamic manner, which could help identify targets for inhibiting OMV-associated toxin delivery and enhance bacterial infections. The method can be extended to a high-throughput format and applied to cell-based assays consisting of bacteria releasing OMVs and host cells without isolating OMVs. The results provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying OMV entry and trafficking, which could aid the development of vaccines and engineered delivery vehicles.
The paper investigated the association between exposure to perfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) and weight change during a controlled weight loss trial. The study found that higher baseline PFAS concentrations were associated with greater weight gain during the follow-up period, especially among women. This was found to be the case for PFOS and PFNA, with PFDA and PFOA showing some associations as well. The association was found to be significant during the weight loss period but not during the weight regain period. The findings suggest that PFAS exposure may have a sex-specific effect on weight regulation, with women being more susceptible to the obesogenic effects. The study provides the first evidence from a controlled weight loss trial that PFAS exposure is associated with weight gain, particularly during the follow-up period, and that this effect is mediated through a decrease in resting metabolic rate. The study highlights the potential for PFAS exposure to play a role in the obesity epidemic and underscores the need for further research to elucidate the mechanisms.
The paper investigates the mechanisms of inflammasome activation in response to Chlamydia trachomatis infection of macrophages. The authors find that intracellular replication of Chlamydia trachomatis and production of a metabolite called cyclic di-AMP is required for activation of both canonical and noncanonical inflammasomes, which in turn activates type-1 interferon signalling through STING. This allows the host to mount appropriate immune responses. However, modulation of cyclic di-AMP production by Chlamydia trachomatis could provide a mechanism of immune evasion and contribute to mechanisms of infection latency. Targeting the STING/interferon pathway may provide useful vaccine adjuvants and therapeutic targets to aid treatment of Chlamydia trachomatis infection and its associated inflammatory pathology. The study demonstrates that intracellular replication of Chlamydia trachomatis and production of the metabolite cyclic di-AMP is a key pathogen-associated molecular pattern that is crucial for inflammasome activation, and that modulation of this metabolite could provide a mechanism of immune evasion.
This paper investigates the role of microRNA-263a/b in protecting sensory organs during developmental pruning. The authors find that miR-263a/b, but not miR-263a, is required for the survival of mechanosensory bristles in the developing eye. When miR-263a is mutated, the bristles are lost in a stochastic manner, indicating that the loss of individual cells is more likely due to chance. In contrast, miR-263a/b mutants show a consistent loss of bristles. The authors propose that miR-263a/b acts as a buffer to prevent the loss of specific cells during developmental pruning, ensuring that only a certain number of cells are lost. They find that miR-263a/b directly represses the expression of the gene hid, which is required for mechanosensory cell survival, and indirectly regulates the expression of the RAS/MAPK pathway. The results suggest that miR-263a/b may play a unique role in ensuring the robustness of sensory organ development.
The paper describes a study on lymphedema management in a resource-poor setting in Haiti where Wuchereria bancrofti filariasis is endemic. The study aimed to test the feasibility and effectiveness of basic lymphedema management as a public health intervention. The study found that patients were able to incorporate basic self-care measures, especially leg washing, into their daily routines and when proper hygiene and skin care were emphasized, the incidence of acute dermatolymphangitis (ADLA) episodes decreased to 31% of earlier levels and these reductions were sustained over time. While leg volume decreased in 78% of patients, these reductions were generally modest and statistically significant only for stage 2 lymphedema. The initial focus on reducing leg volume distracted attention from hygiene and skin care and compression bandages, which were associated with an increase in ADLA incidence. The study suggests that while leg volume is an "objective" measure, it may not be the primary goal of lymphedema treatment in resource-poor settings. The intervention consisted of training clinic staff, giving patients booklets and broadcasting a radio drama, and home visits to support patients. The study found that illiterate patients and those with advanced disease remained at risk of ADLA episodes and that additional effort may be needed for these patients. Despite the limitations, the study suggests that basic lymphedema management is both feasible and effective in filariasis-endemic areas where resources are limited, but simple messages emphasizing hygiene and skin care are important.
This paper presents a population dynamics model to investigate the efficacy of underdominance (UD) and killer-rescue (KR) gene drive systems for controlling mosquito populations. The model considers factors such as mosquito population size, density-dependent larval competition, adult mortality, and migration between populations. The results show that neither population size nor density dependence significantly impacts the outcomes of UD or KR gene drives, but density dependence affects the dynamics of reaching those outcomes. The model is then extended to investigate the effects of gene drive releases and different genetic systems on mosquito populations, showing that UD gene drives can achieve lasting introgression in both target and non-target populations, while KR drives can still produce some degree of population suppression in the target population. The paper concludes that the final outcomes of UD and KR gene drives are robust to ecological factors and may represent feasible strategies for mosquito control. The model provides insights into the impacts of different release strategies, genetic systems and population structure on the efficacy of these gene drive systems. However, the paper acknowledges that further work is needed to refine the model and better understand the impacts of mutations, resistance and human-mediated migration on gene drive efficacy.
The paper presents EmbryoPhenics, an open-source high-throughput platform for phenomics in aquatic embryos. The platform consists of an open-source video microscope (OpenVIM) and software (EmbryoCV) that enable the quantification and integration of interindividual and intraindividual temporal change in morphological, physiological, and behavioral traits with high resolution and at an unprecedented scale. The EmbryoPhenics platform enables the quantification and integration of integrated organismal responses to environmental change using experiments assessing chronic, acute, and interactive effects of environmental stressors. The authors demonstrate the ability of EmbryoPhenics to quantify complex phenome-level responses of large numbers of developing aquatic embryos, including assessing responses to acute and chronic thermal stress. The authors show that EmbryoCV successfully measured phenotypes in two ecologically important species with different developmental patterns, Rhynchonella balthica and Orchestia gammarellus, and provide examples of how EmbryoCV can detect lethal endpoints in embryos. The platform is modular, extendable, and open-source, enabling users to analyze data from a wide range of species and study designs. The authors argue that EmbryoPhenics provides the technological capability for studying organismal development in a way that captures temporal, spatial, and functional diversity at both interindividual and intraindividual levels, which is a major challenge in biology.
The paper discusses the discovery of endogenous hepadnaviruses (hepatitis B virus) fossils in turtle, snake, and crocodile genomes. The study shows that ancient hosts of hepadnaviruses, including birds, coexisted with hepadnaviruses at least as far back as the Early Mesozoic Era, around 207 million years ago. The study finds that the common ancestor of hepadnaviruses did not have an X gene, which emerged de novo in the orthohepadirus lineage. The hepadnavirus genomes have remained relatively stable over time, with the exception of the X gene, which is only present in mammalian hepadnaviruses. The lack of endogenous hepadnaviruses in mammal genomes despite their high genetic diversity and abundant exogenous hepadnavirus infections is puzzling, suggesting that mammals may have had less opportunity to endogenize hepadnaviruses due to slower DNA loss and lower substitution rates. The study proposes that mammalian hepadnaviruses may have emerged more recently, after many millions of years of coexistence with their amniote hosts. The stable genomes of hepadnaviruses and the lack of X gene in non-mammalian hepadnaviruses provide evidence for an ancient coexistence between hepadnaviruses and their amniote hosts.
This paper presents a mathematical model to investigate the effect of IL-7 on CD4+ T cell homeostasis in HIV-infected patients. The model suggests that IL-7 administration leads to a burst of peripheral proliferation that is likely associated with a lingering effect beyond the period of IL-7 administration, which could sustain CD4+ T cell counts. The model indicates that an additional effect of IL-7 beyond peripheral cell proliferation is needed to achieve a durable effect on CD4+ T cell homeostasis. The authors found that a model including an effect of IL-7 on cell survival in addition to proliferation (Model 2) provided a better fit to the data compared to a model with only an effect on proliferation (Model 1). They also found that the effect of IL-7 on loss rate of non-proliferating cells was important for sustaining CD4+ T cell counts. The model predicts that repeated IL-7 administration could be efficient and effective at maintaining CD4+ T cell counts above 50 cells/mL, but more studies are needed to confirm this. The study provides important insights for further development of IL-7 treatment strategies and distinguishing the persistent IL-7 effects involved in CD4 recovery in HIV-infected patients.
This paper examines the role of monocytes in Plasmodium vivax malaria infection. The authors found that monocytes in P. vivax-infected patients have a more activated and inflammatory profile compared to healthy donors. The three main monocyte subsets, classical, inflammatory and patrolling, were identified based on their expression of CD14 and CD16. The classical monocytes (CD14+CD16−) expressed higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, while the inflammatory monocytes (CD14+CD16+) had higher levels of mitochondria and reactive oxygen species. The inflammatory monocytes were the most efficient phagocytes of P. vivax infected reticulocytes and produced higher levels of TNF-alpha. The patrolling monocytes (CD14loCD16+) had lower levels of adhesion molecules and cytokines. The study suggests that highly activated monocytes are characteristic of acute malaria and play an important role in controlling parasite growth and symptoms. The findings highlight the importance of identifying specific targets for therapeutic intervention in this neglected disease.
The paper discusses the role of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in protecting against the bacterial infection Rickettsia typhi. The authors show that both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are capable of controlling the bacteria and preventing disease in mice infected with R. typhi. CD4+ T cells are found to enter the brain and other organs of infected mice and eliminate the bacteria, while CD8+ T cells are more efficient at eliminating the bacteria and preventing disease. However, CD4+ T cells are less effective at protecting mice with advanced infection. Adoptive transfer of CD4+ T cells into R. typhi-infected mice can also prevent disease and eliminate the bacteria. The authors conclude that CD4+ T cells alone are sufficient to protect against R. typhi infection, provided they are present in time, and that both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells together are more effective at controlling the bacteria. They suggest that CD4+ T cell-inducing vaccination may be as effective as inducing CD8+ T cells, and could potentially protect against both R. typhi and related Rickettsia.
This paper investigates the mechanisms by which Vibrio choleraeae O1, the main causative agent of cholera, resists infection by O1-specific phages. The authors find that two genes, wbeL and manA, are responsible for the phase variation of the O1 antigen, which is the dominant cholera antigen. Phase variation mediated by these genes allows some bacteria to be resistant to ICP1 phages. The mutations that confer resistance occur in the poly-A tracts of wbeL and manA, which are critical for O1 antigen biosynthesis. The mutations are reversible, allowing bacteria to switch between the wild type and mutant forms. The study shows that the wbeL and manA phase variants are attenuated in the mouse model, indicating that the mutations are less fit in the host environment. However, when bacteria are exposed to phage pressure in the environment, these mutations can confer resistance to the bacteria, allowing them to persist in the environment. The authors propose that this phase variation is a mechanism by which V. cholerae can respond to the selective pressures of phage predation and the human immune system, allowing some bacteria to persist in the host and resist infection. This phase variation may contribute to the emergence of new strains during cholera epidemics.
The paper discusses how Mycobacterium tuberculosis evades the host immune response by limiting the activation of CD4+ effector T cells in the lungs during in order to persist in the lungs and cause chronic infection. The authors found that even though many CD4+ effector T cells are recruited to the lungs during early stages of infection, only a small proportion of them are activated to produce IFN-γ, which is an important immune response. They hypothesize that this is due to limited availability of antigen for recognition by lung APCs and/MHCII presentation, and/or direct suppression by regulatory T cells. They tested their hypothesis by adoptively transferring CD4+ effector T cells specific for the M. tuberculosis antigen Ag85B peptide 25 into mice and measuring their activation in vivo. They found that the frequency of Ag85B-specific CD4+ effector T cells in the lungs was low and decreased during the chronic phase of infection, consistent with their model. They also constructed a recombinant strain of M. tuberculosis that expressed the antigen at high levels during the chronic phase, which showed increased activation of CD4+ effector T cells. Treatment of mice with peptide 25, which provides more antigen for recognition, also increased CD4+ effector T cell activation and reduced bacterial burden in the lungs. Overall, the results suggest that suboptimal activation of CD4+ effector T cells in the lungs is an important mechanism for M. tuberculosis to persist and evade the host immune response.
The paper investigates the population genetics of Plasmodium vivax in the Peruvian Amazon, specifically in the Iquitos area and surrounding villages. They analyzed genetic data from 292 isolates and found that the population is substructured into at least 3 genetic clusters, with the majority of the genetic variation occurring within villages rather than between areas. The study area with the highest mobility, Iquitos, was found to be the source of parasite spread to the other areas, with people from Iquitos transmitting parasites to other areas through daily travel. A bottleneck events were detected in areas where malaria control interventions had been implemented, indicating that the parasite population had experienced a reduction in effective population size. The study suggests that the predominant clonal propagation found in the population may have contributed to the reduction in malaria incidence seen in the area. The detection of bottleneck events could be used as a complementary tool to measure the efficacy of malaria control programs. The findings highlight the importance of understanding the population dynamics of the parasite population in order to inform future control strategies.
This paper describes the structure and function of Rap proteins, which are repeat proteins that regulate bacterial cell signaling through secreted oligopeptides. The authors determined the crystal structures of RapJ-PhrC, RapJ and RapI, and RapJ alone to understand how these proteins are regulated by oligopeptides. They found that RapJ-PhrC complexes undergo a large conformational change upon binding, which creates new intramolecular contacts that stabilize the closed conformation and inhibit RapJ Spo0F phosphatase activity. This conformational change involves the rotation of the 3-helix bundle and linker region, resulting in the disappearance of the concave groove on the surface of the 3-helix bundle. The residue at position -4 from the C-terminus of the oligopeptide, which is basic, forms a salt bridge with the residue at position 2 of the PhrC, which acts as a hotspot contact. The authors propose that the salt bridge anchors the peptide-receptor complex. They also identified a number of residues at the interface that contribute to specificity and binding energy. The study shows that Rap proteins can undergo large conformational changes upon binding to oligopeptides, which could be exploited to engineer affinity reagents.
The paper proposes a Bayesian framework for phylogenetic inference that incorporates both phylogenetic and spatial uncertainty to reconstruct the dispersal patterns of pathogens. The authors demonstrate the framework on two examples of avian influenza A-H5N1 and rabies virus. They show that the Bayesian approach can infer the migration history in natural time scales and provide insights into the spatial epidemic history of these viruses. The framework allows for the incorporation of geographic priors and the specification of non-zero migration rates, enabling the estimation of the most parsimonious migration graph. The results indicate that the root locations of the phylogenetic reconstruction are less uncertain and that the Bayesian approach can identify epidemiological links between locations more accurately than parsimony analysis. The authors highlight some limitations of the current framework, including the assumption of reversible migration rates and the need for non-reversible models to better fit continuous epidemic dynamics. They argue that the Bayesian approach has advantages over parsimony in terms of being able to control model complexity, estimate posterior probabilities of node states, and incorporate spatial information. The paper demonstrates the ability to perform ancestral state reconstruction and model phylogenetic and spatial uncertainty jointly. The framework has the potential to provide valuable insights into the dispersal patterns of pathogens and inform public health management strategies.
The paper investigates how the inheritance of the X chromosome and the asexual reproduction of aphids affects the location of sexually antagonistic mutations. Aphids have an XX/X0 sex determination system where females have two X chromosomes and males have one X chromosome. The authors use a model to predict that mutations beneficial for males will accumulate on the X chromosome and mutations beneficial for asexual females will accumulate on autosomes. They test this prediction using gene expression data from males, sexual females and asexual females. The results show that male-beneficial genes are enriched on the X chromosome and asexual female-beneficial genes are enriched on autosomes, regardless of the level of dominance of the mutations. This supports the hypothesis that the evolution of sex-biased gene expression may have helped solve intra-locus conflicts by restricting the product of sexually antagonistic alleles to the sex it benefits. The results also show that the X chromosome is masculinized, with male-beneficial genes being enriched on the X and asexual female-beneficial genes being enriched on autosomes. The study highlights the importance of studying systems with unusual modes of inheritance of sex chromosomes, such as aphids and nematodes, to understand the forces driving the evolution of sex chromosomes.
The paper describes a study on the role of the chromatin remodeler protein SNF5 in regulating the balance between pluripotency and differentiation in human embryonic stem cells. The researchers found that SNF5 plays a dual role in fine-tuning the expression of the transcription factor OCT4, which is essential for pluripotency. Upon differentiation, SNF5 represses OCT4-activated genes and activates OCT4-repressed genes, thereby determining the cell fate. Loss of SNF5 leads to cell death, while gain of SNF5 induces premature differentiation. The study shows that SNF5 is required for cell survival during differentiation and plays a critical role in regulating the balance between pluripotency and differentiation. The results highlight the importance of chromatin remodeling complexes in understanding genetic mutations in diseases such as cancer. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of stem cell fate determination and regenerative therapies.
The paper discusses the results of experiments testing the ability of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes in Florida to transmit two emergent strains of Chikungunya virus (IOC and AC). The experiments showed that Ae. albopictus transmitted the virus at a higher rate than Ae. aegypti, especially for the IOC strain, indicating that Ae. albopictus is more competent as a vector for this strain. However, transmission rates decreased over time for both mosquito species, indicating that transmission efficiency declines with length of infection. The study suggests that the shorter extrinsic incubation period of IOC in Ae. albopictus may contribute to its role as vector for this strain. Geographic variation in vector competence was observed among mosquito populations and strains, with Ae. albopictus from Indian River/St. Lucie Co. having higher transmission than other locations. The study highlights the need for further investigation of vector competence across species and populations in different regions, as geographic differences in vector competence may modulate local risks of infection and transmission. However, other factors such as vector survivorship and human biting rate are likely to be more important determinants of transmission potential.
The paper discusses how chronic infections with intestinal worms can affect immune responses. The authors found that chronic infections with the intestinal worm H. polygyrus cause atrophy of skin-draining lymph nodes, which have less cellularity and a reduced capacity to recruit and retain cells, resulting in a diminished immune response to secondary infections. This is not due to specific effects of regulatory and Th2 responses, but rather a broader reconfiguration of the lymphoid system. The authors suggest that the atrophy of skin-draining lymph nodes is due to a redistribution and competition for the available lymphocyte pool, where larger lymph nodes retain more circulating cells. The expansion of mesenteric lymph nodes is constrained and does not fully compensate for the loss of cellularity in skin-draining lymph nodes. The authors propose that deworming can restore lymphocyte cellularity in skin-draining lymph nodes, but this may take time, and a period of time is needed between deworming and vaccination to maximize the outcome.
The paper investigates the role of AMPK in modulating the host lipid metabolism during DENV infection and how this affects the viral replication cycle. The authors found that DENV infection inhibits AMPK activity, which in turn leads to increased activity of the enzyme HMGCR, which accumulates cholesterol and facilitates the formation of replication complexes. The activation of AMPK by metformin or other activators had a significant antiviral effect, suggesting that AMPK is an important host factor required for DENV infection. The authors also found that DENV does not affect P2A activity, which suggests that HMGCR activity is mediated by AMPK. The results suggest that AMPK modulation through lipid metabolism is an important mechanism for DENV to build and maintain replication complexes, and AMPK activation could be a new therapeutic target against DENV.
This paper describes a new mouse model of esophageal cancer development using a tetracycline-inducible Dek (DEK) transgene that can be overexpressed in the basal keratinocytes of the esophageal epithelium. The mice were exposed to the carcinogen 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4NQO) and were found to have increased cell proliferation and a higher incidence of gross esophageal tumors compared to controls. The data suggests that DEK overexpression promotes esophage squamous cell carcinoma growth. The authors conclude that DEK overexpression in basal keratinocytes may contribute to esophageal cancer development and could be a potential therapeutic target. The study demonstrates for the first time that DEK overexpression in vivo promotes esophage squamous cell carcinoma growth, providing evidence that even modest levels of DEK expression can contribute to cancer growth and maintenance.
This paper discusses how the genetic model used to explain the results of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) affects the performance of statistical tests for identifying causal genes associated with complex diseases. The authors simulate a 10 kilobase region of the human genome evolving under different demographic scenarios and genetic models, including additive codominance, multiplicative recession, and a gene-based recession model. They find that under the gene-based recession model, rare alleles of large effect explain a significant portion of genetic variance, but the current GWAS tests are not powerful at detecting these rare alleles. In contrast, tests that use permutation-based p-values, like the ESM test, are more effective at identifying causal genes. The paper argues that the genetic model used to explain the results of GWAS studies is important for both the design and interpretation of these studies, as different models predict different power to detect causal genes. The results suggest that GWAS studies that use a gene-based recession model, which assumes that recessive mutations fail to complement, may be able to detect rare alleles of large effect that are missed by current GWAS tests. The paper also argues that using region-based tests that include all variants, rather than single marker tests, would be more powerful for detecting causal genes.
The paper investigates the organization and integration of core and accessory genes in the multipartite genome of the soybean microsymbiont Sinorhizium fredii. The study shows that core genes are concentrated on the chromosome and chromid, while accessory genes are located on the symbiosis plasmid. The chromid genes are generally more conserved with the species and have a higher fitness in the rhizosphere. The study finds that the chromid genes are more highly expressed in stationary phase and nodules than the chromosomal genes, indicating that the chromid plays a role in stress adaptation. It also finds that accessory genes are linked with the core genes through co-expression networks, and that core genes are more highly expressed in free-living cultures than in nodules. The study suggests that the chromid genes may have a role in host adaptation, while accessory genes are more important for symbiotic adaptation. The results provide insights into the coordinated regulation of core and accessory genes in facultative microsymbionts, and the organization and integration of the prokaryotic pangenome.
The paper describes a study on the replication and stability of SXT/R39 integrative conjugative elements (ICEs), which are found in Gammaproteobacteria. The authors found that while ICEs excise from the chromosome at a lower frequency than they transfer, they are capable of replicating in a subset of cells as a plasmid-like form. This plasmid-like replication is mediated by the relaxase TraI and the origin of transfer oriT. However, the stability of ICEs is not limited by their ability to replicate as they are autonomously replicated only when excised from the chromosome. Instead, conjugation is not a key factor for ICE stability. Instead, the hipAB-like TA system and the plasmid-like replication of ICEBs1 are involved in maintaining the stability of ICEs. The paper shows that SXT/R39 ICEs have a conserved ParM-like partitioning system that is expressed only prior to excision and transfer, and is not required for stable maintenance of the element in the population. The study highlights that SXT/R39 ICEs exhibit features of both conjugative plasmids and integrative elements, blurring the distinction between the two. While ICEs are capable of replication, the plasmid-like form is transient and does not allow stable inheritance. Integration into the chromosome remains the main mechanism for stable transmission of SXT/R39 ICEs.
The paper describes the first thermodynamic analysis of how HIV Gag proteins (Pr5G) and RNA interact during assembly. The study shows that the interaction between Pr5G and RNA is an energetically favorable process, with Pr5G binding to RNA having a higher affinity than binding to GU-containing RNA. The study also finds that the type of RNA sequence interacting with Gag influences the binding affinity, with A-containing RNA binding having higher affinity than GU-containing RNA. Unexpectedly, the p6 domain within Pr5G is found to play a role in the binding of A-containing RNA. The study proposes a model where Pr5G molecules first bind to GU-containing RNA in the cytoplasm, forming low-order oligomers. The Pr5G-RNA complex then traffics to the plasma membrane and acts as a nucleation site for Pr5G assembly, with energy released from Pr5G-Pr5G interactions driving higher-order Pr5G oligomerization. Pr5G-A-containing RNA interactions are also favored, contributing to the assembly of the viral particle. The findings provide insight into the mechanisms of HIV assembly and how the virus derives the energy required to drive the Pr5G-Pr5G assembly.
The paper discusses the role of IL-10 in the immunopathogenesis of leprosy, a neglected tropical disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae. The authors investigated the effect of IL-10 deficiency on the immune response to M. leprae infection in mouse models with either a single IL-10 knockout or both IL-10 and nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2) knockout. They found that IL-10 deficiency resulted in a more inflammatory response and more T cell infiltration into the granuloma, particularly into nerves, in the NOS2-deficient model. This suggests that IL-10 plays a role in tempering the immune response and preventing tissue damage, while a lack of IL-10 in the NOS2-deficient model may lead to a neuropathologic response. The study presents the 10NOS2-deficient mouse as a model for investigating lymphocyte recruitment and tissue damage during long-term M. leprae infection, which could provide insights into leprosy immunopathogenesis and help develop M. leprae-specific diagnostics.
The paper discusses the immune evasion mechanisms employed by the herpesvirus Epstein-Barrus (EBV) during its lytic cycle replication. The authors deleted the gene BNLF2a from EBV recombinant viruses and analyzed the effects on antigen presentation to CD8+ T cells. They found that CD8+ T cell recognition of early and early antigens was increased in EBV transformed cells lacking BNLF2a compared to wild-type cells, indicating that BNLF2a functions to protect these epitopes from being efficiently processed and presented. However, CD8+ T cell recognition of late antigens was not affected in these BNLF2a-deleted cells. This suggests that BNLF2a functions in a stage-specific manner, likely in concert with other immune evasion genes, to reduce efficient T-cell surveillance of reactivating or productively infected cells. The results suggest that immune evasion genes like BNLF2a may play a role in shielding the virus from CD8+ T cell recognition during the early stages of replication.
This paper studies the evolutionary expansion of the Rap-Phr signaling system in bacteria. The authors find that both vertical duplication of the gene and horizontal transfer of genes through gene transfer contribute to the diversification of the Rap-Phr signaling system at different levels of organization. They identify that the acquisition of novel Rap-Phr systems occurs through horizontal gene transfer, while diversification of Rap-Phr specificity is facilitated by intragenic duplication of the autoinducer sequence. They find that putative autoinducer duplications are abundant and can serve as a transient intermediate between two states of specificity. They also observe that Rap-Phr pairs encoded in the same genome maintain orthogonality while some pairs encoded in different genomes show cross-talk. They propose that the ability of Rap-Phr pairs to maintain specificity involves co-evolution of the receptor protein and peptide, with the peptide's specificity influenced by amino acid substitutions. The authors suggest that the observed high diversity of Rap-Phr systems may be driven by a combination of duplication and horizontal transfer, which allows for rapid expansion and adaptation of signaling pathways.
This paper analyzed the nucleotide sequence of the HMA4 gene in the plant Arabidopsis halleri, which is a hyperaccumulator of heavy metals. The authors found that there was evidence of positive selection at the HMA4 promoter region, indicating that natural selection has driven gene copy number expansion and cis-regulatory divergence of this gene. They found that the HMA4 gene has been duplicated twice in Arabidopsis halleri, once before the split from Arabidopsis lyrata and a second time after the split. The gene copy number expansion and cis-regulatory divergence has led to strongly elevated HMA4 transcript levels that are necessary for metal hyperaccumulation and hypertolerance. The authors also found evidence of ectopic gene conversion, which has resulted in a complex genealogy that resembles a network rather than a simple haplotype structure. They conclude that gene copy number variation, likely driven by selection, has played a key role in determining the evolutionary history of the HMA4 gene. The findings suggest that gene copy number variation, particularly in tandem duplications, may be a key mechanism for adaptation in plants. The study highlights the importance of considering gene copy number variation in crop breeding strategies.
This paper studies the motion of African trypanosomes, parasites that cause sleeping sickness in animals and humans. The authors investigate how the parasites move in blood and how this movement helps them evade the host's immune system. They use high-speed microscopy and computer simulations to analyze the parasites' motion in various environments, including blood, cell culture and artificial micropillar arrays. They find that the parasites use a "plane-rotational" type of motion, where the flagellum generates a force that propels the cell forward, while the cell body rotates to generate a helical path. This motion is optimized for efficient locomotion in blood, where it is needed to remove host antibodies. The authors conclude that the plane-rotational motion is likely a genetically fixed adaptation to the crowded environment in the host, but is not easily traceable as it involves the cell's entire structure and flagellum. The study highlights the importance of understanding how the microenvironment affects the parasite's motility in order to combat the disease.
The paper proposes a theory of how the hippocampus, a brain region involved in memory recall, can efficiently recall memories from synapses with limited dynamic range. The theory shows that the optimal recall dynamics involve several critical motifs that were not predicted by standard autoassociative memory models. The key ideas are:   1) The recall dynamics use an approximately optimal solution to autoassociative memory, with all parameters derived from the statistical properties of the recall cue and the storage process, without free parameters to tune.    2) Excitability of neurons should be regulated depending on the efficacies of both incoming and outgoing synapses, reflecting the stored patterns.   3) The recall dynamics are stochastic and can be optimized for a squared-error loss, allowing for a simple representation of uncertainty and accounting for hippocampal flickering phenomena.   4) The recall cue modulates the network dynamics throughout retrieval, reflecting the quality of the memory.   5) The inhibitory circuitry that provides feedback inhibition in CA3 requires a form of feedback inhibition that dynamically tracks excitation, without the need for tonic levels of excitation and inhibition to be balanced.   6) Oscillations in the network can improve recall performance, but at the cost of increased variability.   7) The uncertainty about the recalled memories is represented alongside the memories themselves, allowing for better recall within the network and downstream functions.   The theory makes two main contributions: showing that high-quality recall from metaplastic synapses is possible with neurally plausible dynamics, and providing novel insights into the computational role of several aspects of hippocampal activity. The resulting recall dynamics involve critical motifs that had not been predicted by standard approaches and map onto known features of hippocampal dynamics. The theory provides a range of experimentally testable predictions that can be tested.
This paper describes a computational approach to identify potential c-MYC targets in the human genome. The authors integrated genomic sequence, gene expression data, and functional annotation to predict c-MYC binding sites and target genes. They developed a Bayesian network classifier that predicts the probability of c-MYC binding for each site based on features like distance to transcription start sites, CpG islands, and methylation levels. They used high-quality experimental datasets to validate their predictions and found that their approach correctly identified many known c-MYC targets. They also identified 46 novel c-MYC targets that were not previously reported. They analyzed the co-expression patterns of predicted c-MYC targets in different tissues and found that many shared functional categories like cell cycle and apoptosis. The approach was able to predict the functional categories of the predicted c-MYC targets. The authors conclude that integrating multiple types of data improves the specificity of c-MYC target predictions, but still underestimates the true number of direct c-MYC targets. The paper highlights the complexity of c-MYC binding and regulation and the challenges of distinguishing direct from indirect targets.
The paper proposes a local circuit model of the brain that can represent time on the order of hundreds of milliseconds. The model uses climbing activity in the timing network to estimate intervals, which is controlled by the strength of NMDA receptor conductance. The timing network estimates intervals by the time it takes to reach a fixed threshold. The model shows that estimates conform to Weber's law, which has been observed experimentally. The model can learn new intervals through a simple learning rule. The timing network controls the speed-accuracy trade-off in the decision network by gain modulating the activity of the decision network. The model demonstrates that the encoding of time in the hundreds of milliseconds range is a generic property of local cortical circuits, not a single central clock. The model supports a distributed temporal coding framework. The paper shows that the model can simulate both perceptual tasks with a timing requirement and decision tasks, demonstrating the speed-accuracy trade-off and the ability to estimate deadlines. The model provides a framework for studying the interactions between spatial and temporal codes in decision making.
The paper describes a study on rodent control for Lassa fever in rural Guinea. Rodents, specifically the Natal multimammate mouse (Mastomys natalensis), are known to be the reservoir of the virus. The study aimed to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness of chemical rodent control interventions in controlling rodent populations to reduce the incidence of Lassa fever in the region. The interventions involved distributing anticoagulant rodenticide baits in baiting stations in houses during the dry season when rodents aggregate indoors. The study found that the interventions significantly reduced the rodent population in treated villages compared to control villages, with a decrease in rodent abundance observed up to 3 months after treatment. However, the rodent population returned within 3 months due to factors such as high reproductive rates, nearby fields, porous houses and low predator numbers. The study concludes that a once-a-year intervention is not sufficient to maintain low rodent populations and recommends a holistic approach combining rodent trapping, environmental hygiene, house repairs and rodent-proof storage to prevent rodents entering homes and reduce their impact on human health and crops. The study suggests that a more comprehensive approach involving community involvement and education could be developed to sustainably control rodents and reduce Lassa fever incidence in the region.
The paper presents evidence that Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) can persistently infect adipose tissue, which provides a potential sanctuary for the bacteria. Mtb enters adipocytes through phagocytosis and becomes stressed, leading to the expression of genes associated with dormancy. Adipose tissue infiltration with immune cells, particularly T cells and macrophages, occurs after Mtb infection. Mtb-specific CD8+ T cells and activated NK cells infiltrate adipose tissue, where they produce IFN-γ. The presence of Mtb in adipose tissue correlates with infiltration of immune cells and the expression of genes associated with inflammation. The study demonstrates that adipose tissue serves as a potential reservoir for persistent Mtb infection. The findings provide a basis for rational intervention measures to combat the comorbidity of tuberculosis and type 2 diabetes, for which there is strong epidemiological evidence.
This paper presents a method for modeling the dynamics of the intestinal microbiota under perturbations such as antibiotics. The method uses the generalized Lotka-Volterra model to infer growth rates, interactions and susceptibilities from time-resolved metagenomic data. The model predicts that antibiotics reduce the diversity of the microbiota, leading to an increased susceptibility to colonization by pathogens like Clostridium difficile. The results suggest that the intestinal microbiota is relatively resilient and can persist for a while after perturbation but remains in distinct, perturbation-dependent equilibria. The authors propose a mechanism where certain bacteria like Coprobacillus, Akkermia and Blautia interact positively and inhibit Enteroccus, which in turn facilitates C. difficile colonization. The method has the potential to be applied to other ecological systems and could be used to guide antibiotic selection to reduce the risk of antibiotic-induced enteric disease. The paper demonstrates the potential of combining metagenomic data with mathematical modeling to advance our understanding of the relationship between humans and their microbial inhabitants.
The paper investigates the relationship between the presence of capsular loci in bacterial genomes and their ability to undergo genetic exchanges, specifically horizontal gene transfer and homologous recombination. The authors find that bacteria that encode capsules have higher rates of genetic exchanges, including more integrons, prophages, and mobile genetic elements. This suggests that the presence of a capsule system is associated with a higher likelihood of genetic diversification, even in species that lack a capsule locus. The authors propose four alternative scenarios to explain this association: direct expression of capsules, indirect effects on genetic transfer, increased genetic exchanges directly leading to capsule loci, or capsules directly increasing genetic exchanges. The results are consistent across multiple methods and genomes, and suggest that the association between capsules and genetic diversity is general and not limited to specific mechanisms or mobile genetic elements. The study concludes that bacteria with capsules enjoy a triple advantage of increased resilience, extended time span for adaptation and higher probability of acquiring adaptive traits due to their higher genetic exchanges.
The paper proposes a mathematical model to study the heterogeneity in mosquito-host interactions that can affect the transmission of mosquito-borne diseases. The model considers mosquitoes searching for hosts in a spatially distributed domain with unevenly distributed hosts, and finds that crosswind searching is the most effective strategy for locating hosts, particularly in straight odor plumes. However, for meandering plumes, upwind and downwind searching are better. The model also shows that larger host groups attract more mosquitoes, indicating that spatial arrangement of hosts affects the contact rate. The authors propose a modified contact rate model that accounts for the patchiness of host distribution and can be used to predict mosquito contact rates in larger domains and with different mosquito behaviors. The model can be extended to include factors like breeding sites, host movement, multiple host types, and spatial features like topography, which can affect the host-mosquito interactions. The model can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of different mosquito trap placement strategies in controlling the vector population. The study shows that accounting for the spatial heterogeneity in mosquito-host interactions can provide insights into mosquito transmission dynamics and help design more effective vector control measures.
The paper describes a genomics approach using 3C-qPCR to study centromere coupling in budding yeast. The approach involves crosslinking chromatin and ligating fragments based on their proximity in the nucleus, followed by Taqman-based qPCR to detect interactions between non-homologous centromeres. The authors find that centromere interactions are preferentially based on chromosome size, with smaller chromosomes interacting more with smaller chromosomes and larger chromosomes interacting more with larger chromosomes. This preferential coupling is observed in both diploid and haploid yeast cells, and persists even after homologous chromosomes are paired. The authors propose that the meiotic bouquet helps establish non-homologous coupling based on chromosome size, with shorter chromosomes being closer to the bouquet and more likely to interact with other short chromosomes. The results suggest that the meiotic bouquet plays a role in sorting chromosomes by length, which helps establish non-homologous coupling based on size. However, the authors acknowledge that the data does not perfectly fit a simple size-dependent pattern and that there may be cold and hot spots for coupling. The study demonstrates the advantages of genomics approaches to study biological phenomena in a more systematic and expansive manner, providing insights into the mechanisms of centromere coupling that are not possible with traditional methods.
The paper describes a study on how drug efficacy in vivo is difficult to predict due to complex biochemical processes. The authors investigate drug-target interactions at the single cell level using a monolayer cell culture system that allows continuous monitoring of drug incorporation into individual nuclei. They find that non-specific interactions, such as binding to other macromolecules, can slow drug diffusion within cells and lead to anomalous diffusion. This results in slower drug incorporation kinetics and variability in kinetics among individual cells. The authors propose that cells with faster incorporation kinetics may act as a sink for slower incorporating cells, potentially contributing to drug resistance. The study demonstrates that drug incorporation dynamics vary significantly among individual cells and is influenced by factors such as cell cycle state and spatial organization of drug targets and non-specific interacting molecules within the cell. The findings suggest that optimizing drug efficacy may require taking into account non-specific interactions and accounting for the mismatch between drug kinetics in vitro and in vivo.
The paper presents the results of a nationwide survey conducted in Cameroon to determine the prevalence and distribution of podoconios, a neglected tropical disease caused by exposure to irritant clay soil. The survey found that podoconios was present in 9 out of 10 regions of Cameroon, with the highest prevalence in the Northwest and North regions. The survey used a multi-stage sampling approach to select health districts based on environmental factors associated with podoconis occurrence. The survey found 52 cases of podoconios, with the highest prevalence in the Northwest and North regions. The survey excluded common differential diagnoses and used clinical, parasitological and serological tests to confirm the diagnosis. The findings indicate that podoconis is widespread in Cameroon and warrant interventions to prevent and manage morbidity. The survey also showed that podoconis prevalence increased with age and was slightly more common among males. The results provide evidence for the need for targeted interventions in areas with high podoconios prevalence and highlight the importance of integrating podoconis control into existing neglected tropical disease programs.
This paper investigates the role of transposable elements (TEs) in the adaptation of Drosophila melanogaster after its expansion out of Africa. The authors identify 13 putatively adaptive TEs that are likely to have contributed to adaptation in the recent evolutionary history of the species, based on their relatively high frequencies in non-African populations. They sequence the flanking regions around these TEs to test for signatures of positive selection and find evidence of partial selective sweeps. They also analyze the functional effects of these TEs on nearby genes, and find that most of them affect gene expression in a cis-regulatory manner. The analysis suggests that recent TEs are likely to have arisen as neutral or slightly deleterious polymorphisms in the ancestral African population and only became adaptive upon the species' expansion into temperate environments. The authors estimate that at least 13-250 adaptive TEs have increased in frequency since the species' expansion, which is lower than the expected number of fixed TEs in the genome, indicating that most adaptive mutations are likely to be lost over time. The findings suggest that TEs are a significant source of recent adaptive mutations in Drosophila, but most local adaptations are likely to be ephemeral and lost fairly quickly.
The paper identifies a genomic region in the snail Biomphalaria glabrata that is associated with resistance to the schistosome parasite Schistosoma mansoni. The region, called the Guadeloupe Resistance Complex (GRC), contains 15 genes, including TM1 genes that encode transmembrane proteins with immune-related functions. The GRC shows high genetic diversity, with three highly divergent alleles at intermediate frequencies. The TM1 genes show high nonsynonymous substitution and dN, indicating that they likely recognize parasite molecules and initiate an immune response. The GRC genes show high LD and Tajima's D, consistent with balancing selection. The authors propose that the TM1 genes, particularly grctm5 and grctm6, may be the causal genes for resistance and that genetic dominance of the R allele favors IMA, allowing recognition of multiple parasite strains. The GRC could be a target for controlling schistosomiasis through genetic manipulation of B. glabrata populations, by driving the R allele or duplicating genes.
This paper reviews the impact of vector control and ivermectin treatment on on on onchocercias in Cote d'Ivoire. The paper uses data collected from 1975 to 2016 to demonstrate that vector control through aerial application of insecticides and community directed treatment (CDTi) with ivermectin have had a significant impact on reducing onchocercias prevalence and intensity in Cote d'Ivoire. However, despite the efforts, onchocercias remains a major public health problem due to civil conflict and lack of support from international donors. The paper shows that while CDTi has been integrated and extended to entire districts co-endemic for LF and onchocercias since 2015, MDA has not been implemented consistently in all endemic districts, resulting in gaps in coverage. The paper concludes that achieving 100% geographical coverage for mass drug administration is key to accelerating elimination of neglected tropical diseases like onchocercias. It highlights that onchocercias transmission will persist in areas where MDA coverage is low, and alternative strategies such as twice annual ivermectin distribution, doxycycline test and treat, and larviciding may be needed. The study emphasizes that efforts to control onchocercias in Cote d'Ivoire have made a significant impact despite challenges but more data and support are needed to achieve elimination.
The paper identifies and characterizes an argininosuccinate synthase enzyme (ASS) in Leishmania donovani, a parasitic disease caused by the Leishmania genus of parasites. The enzyme was found to have argininosuccinate synthase activity in vitro and a single point mutation in the ATP binding site resulted in loss of enzyme activity. The enzyme was found to be localized in both the cytosol and a minor fraction in a glycosomal vesicle, suggesting it has a dual compartmentalization. The study suggests that the presence of a consensus tripeptide signal at the carboxyl terminus, SSL, is required for its binding to a peroxisomal receptor PEX5, followed by interaction with the docking protein PEX14. The enzyme was found to be localized in a novel vesicle that shares physical properties with glycosomes, but may have different properties. The study concludes that ASS is a virulence factor that promotes amastigote survival in the host and may be a target for drug design. The paper highlights the potential of targeting ASS while minimally toxic to the human ASS homolog.
The paper proposes a computational model of speech recognition based on a hierarchical, nonlinear dynamical system model derived from birdsong. The model uses Bayesian inference to learn and recognize speech sequences. The model consists of a cochlear model that maps sound waves to neuronal activity, and a generative model that encodes the internal dynamics of the cochlear model into a hierarchical structure of sequential neuronal populations. The generative model consists of two levels: a higher level that encodes sequential activation of neurons in a winner-less competition and a lower level that represents the temporal dynamics of the cochlear model. The model uses precision settings to balance top-down and bottom-up information. The authors show that the precision of the internal states at each level determines whether the model is in learning or recognition mode. The model achieves competitive speech recognition performance even under adverse conditions. The model provides predictions that can be used in neuroimaging experiments to identify the neural basis of speech perception and learning. The model also has implications for speech learning and second language acquisition studies.
The paper discusses the results of a retrospective cohort study of 29 patients with acute Paracocidomycosis (PCM) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The study found that most patients were young adults with low socioeconomic status who presented with symptoms of lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, skin lesions, and bone marrow infiltration. 4 Paracocidomycos strains were isolated from patients, but the results suggest that Paracocidomyces brasiliensis, not Paracidomyces lutzii, is responsible for these severe clinical manifestations. The study highlights the importance of early diagnosis and treatment to prevent complications and death. However, the small number of strains retrieved for molecular analysis limits the conclusions that can be drawn from the study. The authors suggest that epidemiological factors and immune response patterns may help explain the presence of intestinal worm coinfection and that a better understanding of the pathophysiology of acute PCM is needed to improve diagnosis and treatment.
The paper describes a new method called TeXP to quantify the autonomous transcription of LINE-1 elements in RNA sequencing datasets. The authors find that most reads mapping to LINE-1 elements come from pervasive transcription, rather than the active LINE-1 subfamilies. They propose a model that separates reads into LINE-1 subfamilies and estimates the proportion of reads from each subfamily. They use this model to remove the pervasive transcription signal and quantify the autonomous transcription of LINE-1 elements, which is found to be higher than previously estimated. The method is validated using droplet digital PCR experiments and shows that it can detect levels of LINE-1 autonomous transcription that are not captured by other methods. The authors find that LINE-1 autonomous transcription is highest in tissues with high cell turnover rates, and is generally correlated with the level of pervasive transcription. The results suggest that LINE-1 activity in somatic tissues may be higher than previously estimated and that pervasive transcription affects the quantification of LINE-1 activity. The method could be useful for estimating autonomous transcription of other repetitive elements in the genome.
The paper describes the identification of 9 individuals with novel de novo single nucleotide variants (SNVs or small insertion-deletion (indel) in the gene MYT1L. The variants were identified through exome sequencing of 496 trios in the Deciphering Developmental Disorders (DDD) study. The variants were found to be associated with intellectual disability (ID) and obesity, with 5 of the individuals being overweight or obese based on body mass index (BMI) centiles. The expression of the gene MYT1L in the human brain was examined and found to be higher in the cerebral cortex compared to the hypothalamus, which is consistent with the hypothesis that MYT1L loss of function drives the 2p25.3 deletion syndrome. In addition, expression of the gene in zebrafish embryos was used to study its role in the development of the neuroendocrine hypothalamus. The study suggests that loss of MYT1L function may result in hyperphagia and obesity by impairing development of the neuroendocrine hypothalamus. The authors propose that MYT1L mutations may be a new cause of syndromic obesity and establish that the gene is a member of the leptin-melanocortin-M1 pathway, with downstream loss of OXT associated with MYT1L mutations a potential therapeutic target.
The paper proposes a new method called Quadratic Regularized Canonical Correlation Analysis (QRCCA) for pleiotropic analysis of genetic variants with multiple phenotypes. The key idea is to perform a multi-step data reduction approach combining functional principal component analysis (FCA), matrix factorization, and canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to efficiently explore the linkage disequilibrium information in the data. The method uses a quadratically regularized matrix factorization to compress the data and change the representation of genetic and phenotypic variables. The authors show that the QRCCA outperforms 10 other statistical methods in simulated and real data analyses, and can be used for both common and rare variant association analysis. The QRCCA can also be used for cross-phenotype analysis of both continuous and categorical phenotypes. However, the current pleiotropic analysis still has some limitations, such as not being able to identify the global causal structure of pleiotropy, and relying on ad-hoc approaches for selecting the number of basis functions for genotype profile expansion. The paper argues that pleiotropic analysis of high dimensional genomic data will be critical for understanding complex diseases and proposes using causal inference tools to overcome these challenges.
The paper proposes a model to explain the circadian rhythm of phosphorylation of the KaiC protein in cyanobacteria. The authors suggest that the oscillation of KaiC phosphorylation is actually a self-organized process of the individual KaiC hexamers, with each hexamer acting as an independent oscillator. The model includes a two-layer network of KaiA-KaiC and KaiA-KaiB interactions, with KaiB binding to highly phosphorylated KaiC hexamers favoring the phosphorylation. The authors find that the phase of KaiC phosphorylation is mainly determined by the ratio of S431 to T432 phosphorylation sites. The model shows a dynamic diversity of phosphorylation waveforms and phases, which can be explained by a kaleidoscopic mechanism where different KaiC phosphoforms are combined in various proportions to produce different phosphorylation signals. The authors propose that the KaiC phosphorylation network is a primary oscillator and the other KaiC phosphoforms are secondary oscillators, and together they control the circadian transcription. The phase coherence of the KaiC phosphorylation is mainly achieved through the synchronization of the phosphorylation levels of different hexamers. The authors also propose that the oscillation of KaiC phosphorylation is robust against fluctuations in protein concentrations due to the interactions within the hexamers, but the phase coherence of the oscillator can be disrupted if the interactions are modified. The paper presents a framework for understanding the role of KaiC phosphorylation in controlling the circadian rhythm of gene expression in cyanobacteria.
This paper investigates how the genetic diversity of Francisella novicida, a tick-borne bacteria, affects its transmission between ticks and mice. The authors found that while mice can sustain a greater number of genotypes than ticks, ticks are more efficient at restricting the genetic diversity of the bacteria within their population. They found that a larger number of genotypes within the initial infection population reduced the ability of individual ticks to support multiple genotypes, resulting in a reduction in genotypic diversity within ticks. This reduction in genotypic diversity was mediated by competition among genotypes within ticks. The authors used a population model to demonstrate how variations in vector-host ratios, vector and host abundance, and initial genotypic diversity affected the retention of genotypic diversity within the population over time. The model showed that vector-to-host ratios, host abundance, and initial genotypic diversity were the most important factors in maintaining genotypic diversity within ticks, while the actual genetic fitness of the genotypes did not have a significant effect. The results suggest that targeting the pathogen within ticks, such as introducing highly competitive genotypes, could be an effective intervention strategy to disrupt disease transmission. The study highlights the importance of understanding how genotype diversity and interactions within hosts and vectors affect colonization success, which is essential for understanding pathogen transmission, selection and disease ecology.
The paper presents an analysis of genomic regions associated with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in subcutaneous adipose tissue. The authors aimed to gain a better understanding of the functional elements surrounding the genetic variants identified in previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) by measuring DNA methylation and gene expression in adipose tissue from PCOS and control subjects. They identified differentially methylated regions and genes in the regions surrounding the identified susceptibility loci and found that Luteinizing hormone/choriogonadotropin receptor (LHCGR) was overexpressed in non-obese PCOS subjects, while insulin receptor (INSR) was underexpressed in obese PCOS. The findings suggest that LHCGR expression may be a PCOS-specific effect, while INSR expression is related to insulin resistance. Methylation and gene expression profiles were also found to be different between obese and non-obese PCOS subjects, with LCGR overexpression being non-obese specific. The results provide new insights into the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying PCOS susceptibility loci and suggest that different mechanisms may underlie hyperandrogenemia in non-obese versus obese PCOS. The study highlights the potential for subclassification of PCOS based on pathophysiology, which could lead to tailored treatment. The authors note that while they did not fully resolve the functional mechanisms in PCOS loci in adipose tissue, the study provides new information on several of the GWAS loci. Further studies in other tissues relevant to PCOS pathophysiology are needed to fully elucidate the function of these susceptibility loci.
The paper investigates current pain practices in Buruli Ulcer (BU) treatment in Ghana and Benin. It found that healthcare professionals (HCP) perceive patients as exaggerating pain and suppressing expression of pain, while patients themselves perceive pain as uncomfortable or alarming, especially in later stages of the disease. HCP tend to focus pain management on severe pain and prescribe mild medication, while patients expect to be pain-free during hospitalization. The study suggests that cultural factors, differences in pain expression and expectations between patients and professionals, and lack of documentation of pain indications may hinder accurate pain assessment and adequate treatment. The findings suggest that HCP should be trained to assess mild pain and incorporate patient expectations into pain treatment. Improved documentation of pain management and integration of pain assessment into daily practice could help address these issues and provide adequate care for BU patients.
The paper discusses the identification of a protein called FPC4 (Flagellar Pocket Collar protein 4) that is involved in the segregation of the flagellum in the African trypanosome parasite Trypanosoma brucei. The authors used a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify FPC4 as a binding partner of the protein BILBO1 (Bilateral Microtubule-Organizing protein 1). They found that FPC4 is a microtubule-binding protein that localizes to the flagellar pocket collar and hook complex, and is involved in linking the flagellum to the microtubule cytoskeleton. The interaction between FPC4 and BILBO1 is mediated by the N-terminal domain of BILBO1. The authors also showed that FPC4 is a binding partner of the protein MORN1 (Microtubule Organizing Region 1), which localizes to the microtubule-organizing complex in the hook of the flagellar pocket. Overexpression of FPC4 led to the formation of a fibre connecting two flagella, which suggests that FPC4 may play a role in linking the flagella and microtubules. The authors propose that FPC4 may bind the microtubule cytoskeleton and link the flagellum to the microtubule-organizing complex, and that this interaction may be important for flagellum segregation. The paper also discusses the potential role of the FPC in linking the flagellum to the microtubule cytoskeleton.
This paper examines the evolution of postzygotic isolation between two species, Drosophila mauritiana and Drosophila sechellia, that diverged 3000 years ago. The authors use genetic introgressions to study the two rules of speciation, Haldane's rule and the large X effect, which states that hybrid inviability and hybrid sterility are caused by different genetic factors. They introgressed 142 D. mauritiana chromosomal regions into a D. sechellia genetic background and scored the viability and fertility of homozygous and hemizygous introgressions. They found that most hybrid incompatibilities act recessively, supporting Haldane's rule. However, they also found that a significantly higher number of D. mauritiana introgressions caused hybrid male sterility compared to hybrid female sterility, supporting the large X effect. The excess of hybrid male sterility cannot be explained by size differences between the X and autosomes, dominance theory, faster male theory, sex-ratio distortion, or dosage compensation. The authors conclude that there must be an evolutionary cause that they have not identified, likely related to sex chromosome inactivation, spermatogenesis or X-inactivation. The study provides evidence that the X chromosome has a higher density of hybrid male sterility factors.
This paper uses computational methods to study the mechanism of thioredoxin-arsenate reductase, an enzyme that reduces arsenate to arsenite. The enzyme forms a mixed disulfide complex with arsenate, which then dissociates to produce reduced thioredoxin and oxidized arsenate. The authors investigate how the enzyme's cysteine residues are activated to form the mixed disulfide complex, and how the cysteine residue that nucleophilically attacks the arsenate is selected. They use molecular dynamics simulations, pKa calculations, and reactivity analysis to show that the cysteine residue that nucleophilically attacks the arsenate is activated by hydrogen bonding to the protein backbone. Specifically, the cysteine residue that forms a hydrogen bond with the sulfur of the arsenate molecule is activated to form the mixed disulfide complex, which then dissociates by the nucleophilic attack of the other cysteine residue. They argue that the pKa of the cysteine residue is not the sole factor in determining the regioselectivity of the nucleophilic attack, but the local conformational changes around the mixed disulfide complex, the hydrogen bonding of the cysteine residue, and the activated conformation of the enzyme. The study provides a new model for the mechanism of the enzyme's reaction, which is consistent with experimental observations. The methods used, including molecular dynamics simulations, pKa calculations and biochemical experiments, provide a more detailed picture of the mechanism that is not accessible experimentally. The approach demonstrates the power of combining computational and experimental methods to study enzymatic reactions.
The paper describes a mouse model that was used to investigate the role of ATF2 in melanocyte development and melanoma formation. ATF2 was selectively inactivated in melanocytes using a Cre-loxP system to in order to study its effect on melanocyte development. The study found that loss of ATF2 inactivation in melanocytes inhibited melanoma formation in an Nras/Ink4a mutant mouse model. ATF2 negatively regulates MITF expression, which in turn regulates melanocyte development. ATF2 regulates MITF expression through SOX10, which is downregulated by ATF2 and JunB. Inhibition of MITF expression in ATF2-deficient melanocytes partially rescued their ability to form foci on soft agar, suggesting that intermediate levels of MITF are required for melanocyte transformation. Higher MITF expression inhibits melanocyte growth on agar. The study proposes a model where ATF2 regulates MITF expression to fine-tune the levels of MITF required for melanocyte transformation and proliferation. The study identifies a novel mechanism by which ATF2 regulates MITF expression and contributes to melanoma development.
This paper explores the role of the Hippo signaling pathway in regulating human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) senescence and aging. The authors identified that the key component YAP, but not TAZ, is required for protecting hMSCs from premature senescence. They found that YAP transcriptionally activates FOXD1 expression in a TEAD-dependent manner, which in turn alleviates cellular senescence. They demonstrated that down-regulation of FOXD1 contributes to premature senescence in hMSCs, while overexpression of FOXD rescues the senescence phenotype. They also showed that FOXD is a geroprotective factor that can alleviate cellular senescence and osteoarthritis. Intra-articular injection of lentiviruses expressing YAP or FOXD1 reduced the number of senescent cells, inhibited articular inflammation and cartilage erosion, and ameliorated the pathological symptoms of osteoarthritis. These findings suggest that targeting the YAP-FOXD axis with gene therapy may represent a new avenue to treating osteoarthritis.
The paper discusses the structural basis for the interaction between rotavirus and its receptor, the human blood group antigen H. The study shows that the secretory L-fucose moiety of the H antigen binds to the rotavirus protein VP8* in a different way than the Lewisb antigen, resulting in a lower affinity for H1. This difference in affinity may explain why non-secretor individuals are less susceptible to rotavirus infection. The study also identifies a new binding site for H1 antigen within the VP8* protein, which is conserved across different rotavirus lineages, and provides insights into how the different lineages interact with the receptor. The findings highlight the importance of the secretor status of rotavirus as a factor in determining viral infectivity and suggest that subtle changes within the binding site may impact host susceptibility. The study demonstrates that simple carbohydrate-protein interactions beyond the identified binding pocket may also contribute to differences in affinity, and that anti-adhesins like LNB may be useful in preventing rotavirus infection. The results provide new insights into how the host-virus interactions shape the epidemiology of rotavirus infections.
The paper investigates how olfactory receptor neurons are adapted to the odor plumes they detect. The authors use a computational model of the early events in the pheromone reception system of the saturniid moth Antherae polyphemus, which is sensitive to the major pheromone component E,6,1-hexadecadienyl acetate. They predict the characteristics of the optimal pheromone signal that the receptors are adapted to encode based on information theory. They find that the optimal signal has a low intermittency, meaning that pulses of high concentration are less frequent than pulses of low concentration, consistent with the idea that the receptors are adapted to encode information in a way that maximizes the information transferred per time unit. The predicted characteristics of the stimulus, such as the probability distribution of concentration pulses, peak/mean ratio, and spectral density, are found to be in good agreement with experimental measurements. The results suggest that the perireceptor and receptor system is already adapted to the pheromone plumes, indicating that global adaptation mechanisms, such as amplification and convergence of different ORN types, play a lesser role. The results provide evidence that the adaptation of the receptor system is already substantial, rather than just a result of downstream processing. The authors conclude that the adaptation of the receptors is likely an evolutionary adaptation that enables the moth to efficiently detect and respond to the pheromone plumes.
This paper describes a study conducted in an informal settlement in Kenya to assess community knowledge, attitudes and practices towards Schistosomiasis. The study found that community knowledge and awareness of the disease was low and negative, with participants perceiving it as a severe infection that could lead to death. However, people only practiced home management of symptoms and rarely sought medical care due to perceived high cost and unavailability of treatment. Participants believed drinking contaminated water was the major cause of the disease and defecating in open areas contributed to transmission. Stigma also discouraged people from seeking medical care. The study identified several factors that promoted transmission, including poor sanitation, overcrowding and cultural beliefs. The researchers suggest that health education and provision of free treatment and diagnostic kits in endemic areas would be effective in controlling Schistosomiasis.
This paper investigated how the mTORC1 signaling pathway is activated by influenza virus during infection and what proteins are affected by this activation. The study found that mTORC1 activation by influenza virus requires AKT phosphorylation at T38 and T47 sites, which is mediated by PDPK1. Influenza virus activates mTORC1 through phosphorylation of AKT at T38, but not at T47, suggesting that mTORC2-mediated phosphorylation of AKT at S473 is not required. Influenza virus downregulates the mTORC1 inhibitor REDD1, which enhances mTORC1 signaling. mTORC1 activation promotes viral protein expression and replication. mTORC1 regulates translation and other cellular processes, including autophagy and apoptosis, which can influence viral replication. The study identified mTORC1-dependent substrates during influenza infection, including translation factors like eIF4E and eIF4G1, and apoptosis-related proteins like FasL. These results suggest that mTORC1 signaling supports viral replication by regulating translation and apoptosis. Overall, the study provides new insights into how influenza virus exploits the mTORC1 signaling pathway to promote viral replication.
The paper proposes a new order parameter called "regulation entropy" to measure the signed topology of biological regulatory networks. It shows that biological networks in general have low regulation entropy, which means that most regulations are consistent and coherent, rather than sending self-contradictory commands. This coherence in regulations enhances the robustness of the network, allowing it to produce a reliable dynamic behavior even with parameter variations. The paper uses Boolean network models to demonstrate that networks with low regulation entropy tend to have relatively stable dynamics and structural stability, which explains why biological control networks like the budding and fission yeast cell cycles can be well-modeled by Boolean networks. The regulation entropy is found to be negatively correlated with the basin size and parameter sensitivity of the network, indicating that networks with consistent regulations are more robust. The results suggest that the low regulation entropy of biological networks is a key factor in their ability to achieve dynamic stability and function reliably.
The paper discusses how the geographical scale at which schistosomiasis prevalence data is aggregated affects the estimated amount of treatment needs for preventive chemotherapy in school-aged children. The authors found that the total amount of praziquantel treatments required is higher when calculated at a smaller administrative unit of schistosomias prevalence aggregation, such as district level, rather than country level. This is because in countries with moderate endemicity, the prevalence of schistosomiasis is not uniformly distributed throughout the country, and there are often pockets of high-risk areas that exceed the 50% threshold for moderate endemicity. In contrast, countries classified as highly endemic have a more uniform distribution of schistosomiasis risk, so calculating prevalence at a higher administrative level results in fewer treatments. The authors suggest that stratifying areas based on geography and freshwater bodies, rather than administrative boundaries, is a more appropriate way to plan preventive chemotherapy. However, this requires more accurate data on schistosomias prevalence at the local level, which is currently lacking. The paper concludes that geostatistical modeling can help estimate treatment needs based on schistosomias risk at different administrative levels, but that a multi-pronged approach that includes preventive chemotherapy, snail control, improved sanitation, and behavior change may be needed to achieve transmission control.
The paper discusses the results of a cluster-randomized survey conducted in two regions of The Gambia to assess the prevalence of active trachoma and ocular Chlamydia trachomatis in children aged less than 10 years. The survey found that the overall prevalence of active trachoma in children aged 0-9 years has not changed significantly since a previous national survey conducted 10 years ago, with prevalence ranging from 10% to 12%. However, the prevalence of ocular Chlamydia trachomatis was very low, with only 3 of 94 samples from one region testing positive for the infection. The survey suggests that trachoma may be declining in The Gambia, with the prevalence of clinical signs lagging behind the prevalence of infection. The low prevalence of ocular Chlamydia trachomatis indicates that treatment with antibiotics is likely not necessary in many communities, as transmission of the infection is now presumed to be rare. The findings support the strategy of treating households containing someone with active trachoma in order to reach infected but clinically normal individuals. The paper concludes that a rapid, point-of-care test for ocular Chlamydia trachomatis could be useful for guiding treatment decisions, and that further research is needed to understand the epidemiology of trachoma and its progression.
This paper reports cryo-EM structures of the SARS-CoV spike protein in different conformations, including the prefusion, ACE2-bound and low-pH-treated states. The authors used cryo-EM and biochemical methods to investigate the conformational changes that occur during the entry of SARS-CoV into cells. They found that cleavage of the S1/S2 site does not significantly affect the overall structure or conformation of the spike protein. However, binding of the receptor ACE2 triggers a conformational switch of one CTD1 to the "up" position, which exposes the S2' cleavage site and allows formation of the postfusion state. Dissociation of the S1 subunit from the trimer can occur during this process. The authors also observed that only one CTD1 was observed in the "up" position in their structures, indicating that binding of ACE2 can open up this conformation. They also found that receptor binding can trigger the release of one S1 subunit from the spike, allowing the S2 subunits to form the postfusion six-helix bundle. These findings provide new insights into the entry mechanism of SARS-CoV and how the spike protein changes conformation during in response to receptor binding and low pH.
This paper investigates the role of the chromatin remodeler FACT in the repair of oxidatively damaged DNA. FACT is released from transcriptionally active chromatin and relocated to chromatin loci associated with repair proteins and remodelers involved in DNA repair. FACT boosts the ability of the remodeler RSC to mobilize nucleosomes and slid end-positioned nucleosomes, allowing efficient repair of lesions. FACT does not alter nucleosome structure as judged by DNase I footprinting and restriction enzyme accessibility assays, but instead increases the efficiency of RSC-induced remodeling. FACT likely acts on the nucleosome substrate or on both RSC to facilitate remodeling, although the exact mechanism is unknown. The paper concludes that FACT likely functions as a "co-remodeler" for RSC, boosting the efficiency of remodeling by allowing nucleosomes to be more easily mobilized and repaired. FACT's ability to mobilize nucleosomes via RSC may be an important mechanism for DNA repair.
The paper examines the genetic diversity within and between the IAEA colony of Glossina pallidipes and its potential source populations in Uganda and Zambia. It uses ABC and population genetic analyses to infer the demographic history of the IAEA colony and identify the most likely source population. The results suggest that the IAEA colony likely originated from the Kenya/Uganda border, with a severe genetic bottleneck occurring around the time of its establishment. This bottleneck caused a loss of genetic diversity in the colony, which contrasts with the genetic diversity observed in the source populations. The ABC analysis indicates that the effective population size of the colony at the time of establishment was around 27 individuals. This loss of genetic diversity may have negative impacts on the efficiency of sterile insect technique (SIT) control, as some genetic characteristics important for mating competitiveness could have been lost. The results demonstrate the usefulness of ABC methods for detecting genetic bottlenecks and provide insights into the potential genetic impacts of rearing organisms in captivity for SIT. However, the genetic diversity of the IAEA colony is still lower than that of field populations, highlighting the need for caution when interpreting results obtained from the colony regarding the biology of G. pallidipes.
The paper describes how the authors used Wikipedia article view data to estimate current levels of influenza-like illness (ILI) activity in the US. They compiled a list of 32 Wikipedia articles related to influenza, ILI, or health in general and selected a set of background articles to control for normal usage. They used a generalized linear model framework to estimate the ILI activity based on the number of views of these articles. Two models were developed, one including all relevant articles and another that used Lasso regression to select the most important predictors. The models were compared to CDC ILI data and Google Flu Trends data. The results showed that the Wikipedia models were able to estimate the ILI peak within a reasonable range of error compared to CDC data, but with some differences in timing. While Google Flu Trends was more accurate in estimating the peak ILI activity, the Wikipedia models were generally more accurate in estimating the timing of the peak. The authors conclude that Wikipedia article view data has the potential to be used for real-time monitoring of ILI activity and could potentially be used to predict upcoming weeks. However, the models need further improvement and validation to fully realize this potential. The paper demonstrates that non-traditional data sources like Wikipedia can provide valuable insights into public health issues.
The paper describes the role of two inflammasome components, NLRP3 and NLRC4, in the host defense against Candida albicans infection. The authors find that infection with Candida leads to up-regulation of NLRP3 and NLRC4 expression in the oral mucosa, which is impaired in mice deficient in either component. Inflammasome activation is required for IL-1β responses, which in turn drive the induction of other pro-inflammatory genes like IL-17A, IL-18, and IL-6. The absence of NLRP3 and NLRC4 leads to impaired neutrophil infiltration and reduced antimicrobial peptide production, leading to increased oral fungal colonization and disease severity in mice. The authors propose that initial activation of NLRC4 may occur as an early event in fungal infection, leading to the induction of innate responses that recruit inflammatory cells and limit infection. The results suggest a tissue-specific role for NLRC4 in the host defense against non-bacterial pathogens like Candida.
The paper analyzed over 300,000 degrees of freedom and t-values from papers in cognitive neuroscience and psychology journals between 2010 and 2014 to assess the power and reproducibility of published results. It found that power levels were very low, with most studies having less than 20% power to detect a true effect size. The authors estimated that false positive rates (FRP) were likely over 50%, even in the absence of bias. The low power levels were attributed to factors like low participant numbers, complicated instrumentation and analysis, and selective reporting of results. The authors suggest that preregistration of study objectives and enforcing higher statistical significance thresholds could help address the issues. They also note that cognitive neuroscience and psychology have lower power levels compared to other fields, which may lead to high FRP. The findings suggest that low power and selective reporting of positive results are major contributors to the reproducibility crisis in cognitive neuroscience and psychology.
The paper describes a study on the regeneration of the entire body of a colonial ascidian, Botrylides leachi, which can regenerate its zooids from minute blood vessel fragments. The authors found that whole body regeneration (WBR) in Botrylides involves three distinct developmental phases and that RA signaling is involved in the process. They identified a RAR receptor expressed throughout the entire body during WBR, specifically in haemocytes within the vasculature. They showed that disrupting RA signaling through inhibited WBR and resulted in malformed buds. The use of RA signaling through overexpression of RARβ, which promotes functional regeneration in some vertebrate tissues, was found to promote WBR in Botrylides. The study reveals that the entire developing zooid body is susceptible to RA signaling during WBR. The results suggest that RA signaling plays multiple roles in WBR beyond its role in early stages, including maintenance and possibly other unknown processes. The authors conclude that the Botrylides WBR model may serve as a system to study the evolutionary roots of organism regeneration, as it involves the redeployment of developmental mechanisms and signals.
The paper discusses the results of an experiment where the authors investigated the hepatotoxicity of Schistosoma mansoni eggs in a primary hepatocyte culture system. They found that Schistosoma mansoni eggs and their derived fractions, including pure proteins, induced hepatotoxicity in cultured hepatocytes. They identified two major hepatotoxins: omega-1 and IPSE/alpha-1. Depletion of these proteins with specific antibodies reduced hepatotoxicity. The authors suggest that there may be additional hepatotoxins that were not identified by their methods, but that omega-1 and IPSE/alpha-1 together account for approximately 60% of the toxicity of the egg-derived material. The results highlight the paradox of the granulomatous response in hepatic schistosomiasis, which while protecting against acute hepatocyte injury, ultimately leads to chronic liver damage. Understanding the mechanism of hepatotoxicity may help develop treatments for schistosomiasis.
The paper describes an experimental approach to measure the independent effect of regulatory regions other than promoters, specifically 3' end sequences, on gene expression levels. The authors constructed a library of yeast strains where a synthetic 3' end sequence was integrated downstream of a fluorescent protein reporter gene, but not the promoter. They measured the expression of 85 different 3' end constructs and found a wide range of expression levels, indicating that 3' ends can span a continuous and dynamic range of expression values. They found that nucleotide composition upstream of the polyadenylation site correlated with expression levels, suggesting that efficient 3' end formation may contribute to the observed differences in expression. They also found that high A/T content in the upstream region of the 3' end correlated with higher expression levels. They showed that the independent effect of 3' ends on expression was significant, but relatively small compared to the effect of promoter sequences. They demonstrated that 3' ends mainly affect the average size of protein bursts rather than the frequency of bursts. The results suggest that 3' end sequences are a promising candidate for designing circuits that require specific changes in expression levels with little effects on noise. The approach provides insights into the different layers of gene expression regulation involved in observed protein levels and highlights the importance of the 3' end sequence as a genomic region that may have a significant effect on mRNA levels.
The paper proposes a new method called GP4Rate that combines a Gaussian process with phylogenetic models to identify functional sites in proteins. The Gaussian process defines a prior distribution over amino acid substitution rates at different sites in a protein structure, allowing the model to naturally capture spatial correlations between sites. The method uses a zero-mean Gaussian process to model the distribution of substitution rates, which is estimated from the data using Bayesian inference. The method is able to outperform existing methods that assume independence between sites, showing that functionally important sites tend to be located close to each other in the protein structure. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of GP4Rate on simulated and real data, outperforming other methods in identifying functional sites in a protein. The key advantage of GP4Rate is that it can model spatial correlations between sites, allowing it to better distinguish slowly evolved functional sites from non-functional ones. The method is computationally slower than existing methods but can still be useful for small scale analyses.
The paper investigates the role of hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α) in Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) infection and its effects on primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) cells. PEL cells are AIDS-related malignancies that develop in the context of a compromised immune system. The authors found that HIF-1α is expressed in PEL cells, even under normoxic conditions, and is important for the growth and survival of these cells. HIF-1α knockdown in PEL cell lines leads to a reduction in glycolysis, lipid synthesis and expression of key KSHV genes, as well as a decrease in the expression of certain KSHV latent genes. The authors propose that targeting HIF-1α could be a potential therapeutic strategy for KSHV-associated malignancies. They demonstrate that a small molecule inhibitor of HIF-1α selectively impairs the growth of KSHV-positive cells, while having little effect on KSHV-negative cells. They show that HIF-1α plays a key role in maintaining the growth, metabolism and expression of KSHV genes in PEL cells, even under normoxic conditions. Overall, the study suggests that targeting HIF-1α could be a promising approach for treating PEL and potentially other KSHV-induced tumors.
The paper discusses the regulation of competence in the bacterium Bacillus subtilis. Competence is a developmental state in which the bacteria become capable of producing extracellular spores, biofilms, or cannibalism. The authors find that the decision to enter this state is determined by a gradual increase in the amount of a protein called Spo0A, which increases throughout growth and then decreases as the cell enters stationary phase. This increase in Spo0A amplifies an inherent increase in the expression of a gene called comK, which in turn activates genes for spore production. However, the amount of Spo0A itself does not determine which cells will become competent. Instead, a programmed increase in Spo0A acts as a "temporal gate" that modulates the probability that fluctuations in comK expression will lead to competence. The authors propose that the basal level of Spo0A and the subsequent increase in comK expression determine the window of opportunity for cells to become competent, with most cells failing to enter this state. The noise in comK expression is the major factor determining cell fate, but Spo0A acts to shape the window of opportunity.
This paper describes the development and validation of a method to detect the presence of the tapeworm species Taenia serialis in dried gelada urine. The researchers found that while only 4.8% of geladas exhibited visible cysts, 18% tested positive for T. serialis antigen in their urine samples, indicating that the infection was more widespread than previously thought. This suggests that some individuals may have young or deep-seated infections that are not yet visible. The results suggest that T. serialis infection is more flexible in its intermediate hosts than previously believed and that some individuals may eliminate or control infections, leading to fluctuations in antigen presence in urine samples. The findings provide insights into the dynamics of T. serialis infection in geladas and highlight the potential for infection to pose a risk to other primates and humans, particularly if exposure is the primary driver. The use of dried urine samples for in wildlife studies provides a practical means of monitoring T. serialis infection without the need for refrigeration or invasive procedures. However, the assay is genus-specific and cannot identify the species of T. serialis present. Further research is needed to determine the drivers of susceptibility and exposure to T. serialis and inform control efforts.
This paper describes the development and evaluation of a new multiplex Real-Time PCR method for genotyping Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite that causes Chagas disease. The method uses TaqMan probes to detect six distinct genotypes (DTUs) in a single or two sequential reactions, allowing for the analysis of biological and clinical samples. The method was tested on a panel of reference stocks and clinical samples, and showed comparable sensitivity to conventional PCR methods for detecting the six genotypes. However, the Real-Time PCR method was less sensitive for detecting mixed infections in clinical samples, particularly those with low parasite loads. The study suggests that the method could be a valuable tool for surveillance and outbreak detection, as well as for identifying sources of infections in transplant recipients who receive organs from seropositive donors.
The paper presents a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the possible association between Toxoplasma gondii infection and Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), an autoimmune disease causing pain and disability. The authors found that the prevalence of Toxoplasmosis in RA patients was significantly higher than in controls, ranging from 25-7% compared to 2%. The overall seroprevalence of Toxoplasmosis in the studies was 46%, which was significantly different from the 2% in controls. The heterogeneity between the studies was high, which may be due to differences in genetic potential and environmental factors affecting host response. The authors suggest that Toxoplasma gondii may trigger a pathological process that leads to RA and that high prevalence of Toxoplasma in people with chronic diseases may be due to its ability to exacerbate those diseases and treatment with immunosuppressive drugs. However, the study had some limitations such as small sample sizes, diverse methods of measuring anti-parasitic antibodies and lack of evaluation of risk factors like age and gender. Further studies are needed to achieve more accurate results and clarify the pathogenesis of Toxoplasma gondii in humans.
The paper investigated the effects of Wolbachia infection on the vector mosquito Aedes aegypti's ability to transmit dengue virus. The study found that Wolbachia infection significantly delays the time when the virus arrives in the mosquito's saliva, reduces the frequency that the virus is expectorated, and decreases the amount of virus in the mosquito's saliva. The reduction in saliva production in Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes can at least partially explain these observations. The delay in virus arrival and reduction in saliva production in Wolbachia mosquitoes suggest that Wolbachia infection may modulate virus transmission by the mosquito. The study found that the lengthening of the extrinsic incubation period (EIP) and reduction in saliva virus titer in Wolbachia mosquitoes indicate an additional means by which Wolbachia could modulate virus transmission. However, the study also found that Wolbachia infection lengthens the lifespan of mosquitoes post-infection, which could potentially enhance the vectorial capacity of Wolbachia mosquitoes. The findings suggest that Wolbachia infection may be a promising strategy to reduce dengue virus transmission, but further research is needed to fully understand how temperature and other environmental factors affect the interactions between the mosquito, virus and Wolbachia.
The paper proposes a new approach for identifying pleiotropy using Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and a genetic algorithm as an optimization method. They use CCA to find linear combinations of genotype and phenotype data that maximally correlate with each other. They divide the analysis into four stages: gene-centered association between one gene and one phenotype, gene-centered association between one gene and multiple phenotypes, association between multiple genes and one phenotype, and association between multiple genes and multiple phenotypes. They found pleiotropic effects in genes ABO, SURF4, F10, IL18RAP, IL23R, IL2RAP and NRG1. The approach was able to identify pleiotropic associations that were not detected by other methods. However, they also found some limitations of CCA, such as lack of power for large genes and potential for false positives due to multiple testing. They propose using other optimization methods like Tabu Search, Particle Swarm Optimization or Genetic Algorithm to improve the search. They also found enrichment analyses that revealed interesting biological insights, such as associations with coagulation pathways, inflammation and cardiovascular development. The approach demonstrated the power of CCA for identifying pleiotropy in multivariate genomic data and the importance of considering biological insight in feature selection.
This paper describes how the Robo receptor, a guidance receptor involved in midline guidance, is regulated by endocytosis. The authors find that Slit binding to Robo triggers endocytosis of the receptor, which is required for Robo activation and proper signaling. In vitro, they show that deleting Robo's endocytosis motifs or inhibiting endocytosis leads to reduced surface receptor levels and impaired process elaboration. In vivo, they find that endocytosis-defective Robo proteins are mislocalized to the midline and fail to rescue midline guidance defects in Robo mutants, indicating that endocytosis is required for Robo's repulsive activity. They propose that Slit binding induces Robo endocytosis and recruits downstream effector Son of Sevenless to the early endosome, which is important for Robo activation. The results suggest that endocytosis mechanistically contributes to Robo's activation by gating access to its downstream effectors. The findings provide insight into how midline guidance is established during development and how guidance cues are transmitted to the growth cone.
This paper discusses the role of the small G protein Arf4 in the targeting of transmembrane proteins to the ciliary membrane in primary cilia. The authors show that Arf4 interacts with the ciliary targeting sequence (CTS) of the protein fibrocystin, which lacks a VXPX motif that is known to be a binding site for Arf4. However, Arf4 still interacts with the CT and is required for efficient delivery of fibrocystin to the cilium. Arf4 is not required for ciliary assembly, but is needed for trafficking newly synthesized fibrocystin to the cilium. Arf4 mutant mice die around embryonic day 9, indicating that Arf4 has functions beyond targeting ciliary proteins. The highest expression of Arf4 is in the visceral endoderm, which is not ciliated at the time of expression. Arf4 is required for the efficient trafficking of the scavenger receptor megalin to the apical surface of the visceral endoderm. The work suggests that Arf4 has a broader role in cellular trafficking beyond targeting ciliary proteins.
The paper examines the effect of recombination on the rate of adaptation in a population evolving on a realistic fitness landscape. The authors estimate a fitness landscape for HIV-1 based on an in vitro assay and use this landscape to simulate adaptation on the population dynamics. They find that recombination significantly accelerates adaptation by increasing genetic variance, which in turn enhances the efficacy of natural selection. Both main effects and epistatic interactions contribute to the accelerating effect of recombination, with the epistatic effects appearing to be negative. The authors argue that the observed negative epistasis suggests the mechanism of acceleration through reduction of negative linkage disequilibria. However, they note that the limitations of their approach make it difficult to determine the exact impact of epistasis and the direct effect of recombination. The study highlights the potential role of recombination in accelerating adaptation in retroviral and HIV evolution, but does not include specific features of HIV biology. Overall, the results demonstrate that recombination can be an important factor in facilitating adaptation on complex fitness landscapes.
The paper discusses the role of exon 7 of the Xist RNA in the stable localization of Xist RNA on the Xi during X-inactivation. The authors generated Xist exon 7-truncated mutant ES cells by inserting tandem polyadenylation signals into exon 6 of Xist. They found that the truncation of Xist RNA did not affect the expression or stability of the RNA during X-inactivation. However, the XistdelEx7T6T6 mutant cells exhibited impaired localization of Xist RNA and H3K27me3 on the Xi, indicating that exon 7 of Xist RNA is essential for stable Xist RNA localization and X-linked gene silencing. The authors showed that hnRNP U interacts with both exon 1 and exon 7 of Xist RNA and is required for the stable localization of Xist RNA on the Xi. The interaction between hnRNP U and exon 7 of Xist RNA is crucial for stable Xist RNA localization and X-linked gene silencing. The authors propose that multiple hnRNP U binding to exon 1 and 7 of Xist RNA within one molecule might facilitate the formation of an aggregated hnRNP U-Xist RNA complex, which stabilizes the functional RNP complex. The results provide novel insights into how Xist RNA is stably anchored onto the Xi and highlight the importance of the interaction between Xist RNA and hnRNP U in X-inactivation.
The paper summarizes the current knowledge on the geographic distribution, prevalence, diversity of Leptospira spp. infection in animal hosts, and burden of human leptospirosis in Africa. While leptospirosis is a neglected disease in Africa, this systematic review found that acute human leptospirosis is an important cause of non-specific fever in hospital patients across the continent, with acute leptospirosis reported in up to 19.8% of patients with non-specific fever illness in hospital-based cohort studies. The majority of Leptospira spp. infections were detected in South Africa and Tanzania, with 17 Leptospira species identified in humans and 12 in animals. However, the available estimates of leptospirosis incidence in Africa are limited and likely underestimate the true burden due to underreporting. The paper highlights the need for integrated human and animal studies in the same geographic areas to better understand the relationship between human and animal Leptospira infections, which may help identify key animal reservoirs and transmission routes for the disease. The impact of Leptospira infection on livestock productivity in Africa is also poorly understood, and controlling Leptospira infection in livestock species could have indirect benefits for human health and well-being.
This paper describes a mouse model of dystonia caused by a mutation in the ATP1A3 gene, specifically the D801Y mutation. The D801Y mutation is known to cause a rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism disease in humans. The authors found that mice with the D801Y mutation exhibited severe hypothermia-induced dystonia that correlated with abnormal cerebellar activity, including irregular firing of Purkinje cells and DCN neurons. The authors suggest that the cerebellum is particularly susceptible to dysfunction caused by alterations in the α3 isoform of the Na+/K+-ATPase, which is expressed by Purkinje cells and not the other ubiquitously expressed α1 isoform. They show that the D801Y mutation abolishes Na+/K+ exchange, but still binds 3 Na+ ions, and the resulting pumped protons may be trapped in a proton-importing state. The irregular firing of Purkinje cells and DCN neurons is thought to be the underlying cause of the dystonia. The paper suggests that the cerebellum is particularly susceptible to dysfunction caused by alterations in the α3 isoform of the Na+/K+-ATase, which may have implications for future therapeutic intervention.
The paper uses a model of inter-species competition between Bacillus subtilis and Streptomyces mg1 to identify new functions for the bacterium Streptomyces. The authors find that when cultured together, Streptomyces produces linearmycins that cause lysis and degradation of Bacillus colonies. They identify the genes responsible for producing linearmycins and find that a two-component system, YfiJ-LM, is involved in the resistance to these antibiotics. The mutants that are resistant to linearmycins have a wrinkled colony morphology and increased motility. The mutations in YfiJ that confer resistance occur in the cytoplasmic linker and the regulatory domain. The YfiLM transporter is necessary and sufficient for linearmycin resistance. The authors propose that the YfiJ-LM system provides a specific resistance mechanism that coordinates cellular growth and motility changes with resistance to linearmycins, allowing Streptomyces to compete more effectively against Bacillus. This mechanism is different from other known TCS-ABC transporter pairs in B. subtilis. The study demonstrates that microbial competition can be used to identify functions for previously uncharacterized TCS and ABC transporters that promote competitive fitness.
The paper reviews 47 cases of spinal echinococococcosis (hydatid disease) that primarily affects the thoracolumbar spine, involving the vertebral levels with gradually ascending involvement. The authors find that primary spinal echinocococcosis is more common than secondary spinal echinocococcosis and that patients with a history of surgery for extraspinal echinocococcosis are more likely to have thoracic involvement. They also find that patients with intradural echinocysts present at a younger age than those with extradural echinocysts. They note that while significant advances have been made in diagnosis and treatment of echinocococcosis, many aspects remain poorly understood, including the parasite's predilection for the spine and the differences in local manifestation and evolution between primary and secondary echinocococcosis.
The paper describes a study that analyzed the transcriptomes of human, chimpanzee and rhesus macaque brain tissue using high-throughput sequencing. The authors found that a large proportion of transcripts are expressed outside known gene boundaries, and that the brain transcriptome of humans is more complex than other tissues. They identified highly transcribed regions (HTR) that are not annotated as genes, but have characteristics of exons and introns. These HTRs show conserved expression across species, including high expression levels and enrichment of conserved microRNA binding sites. They suggest that some of these HTRs may represent novel coding or non-coding RNA functions in the primate brain. The authors found that exons and introns together account for most of the non-ribosomal transcripts, while intergenic transcripts are more evenly distributed. They also identified regions with extreme species-specific expression patterns that may indicate regulatory evolution. The study suggests that some of the identified HTRs may represent novel functions in the human brain. However, intra-species variation estimates and direct comparisons to previous studies were not performed, so further work is needed to confirm these findings.
This paper investigated the role of the Chlamydomonas DYX1C1 gene in the assembly of ciliary dyneins, which are important for cilia function. The authors found that a mutation in the DYX1C1 gene in the Chlamydomonas pf23 mutant, which lacks inner dynein arms, results in a partial failure of dynein assembly. The mutant displays a ciliary phenotype similar to that of the human PCD patients with defects in dynein preassembly. The authors identified that DYX1C1 is required for the preassembly of ciliary dyneins in the cytoplasm, and that the DYX domain of DYX1C1 is essential for the preassembly of inner dynein arms. They showed that DYX1C1 is cytoplasmically localized in Chlamydomonas cells and functions independently of other dynein preassembly factors. The study suggests that DYX1C1 is a ciliary dynein preassembly factor that is needed for stability of ciliary dyneins both in the cytoplasm and in the axoneme. The authors propose that DYX1C1 may provide a scaffold for the association of various dynein components and mediate protein-protein interactions, which could be involved in the preassembly of dyneins. The study provides insights into the molecular mechanism of dynein assembly and cilia function, and highlights the importance of DYX1C1 in ciliary dynein preassembly.
The paper investigates the role of the mitochondrial m-AA protease complex in adult oligodendrocytes, which are glial cells that provide myelin for nerve fibers in the central nervous system. The authors generated mouse models with different levels of the m-AA protease in oligodendrocytes and found that complete ablation of the m-AA protease in oligodendrocytes triggered rapid cell death, while reduced levels of the m-AA protease allowed oligodendrocytes to survive for a long time. This suggests that the threshold of m-AA protease activity required for survival is different in neurons and glial cells. The m-AA protease is required for oligodendrocyte survival, but not neurons. The authors found that oligodendrocyte mitochondria had abnormal morphology and died after complete ablation of the m-AA protease, indicating that the m-AA protease is important for maintaining mitochondrial function in oligendrocytes. The m-AA protease also triggered a stress response in oligendrocytes that led to mitochondrial fragmentation. The authors also found that premature hair greying occurred in mice lacking the m-AA protease in oligodendrocytes. The study provides insights into the survival mechanisms of oligodendrocytes, and may help explain the pathologies associated with mutations in genes encoding m-AA protease subunits in humans.
The paper discusses the structure and function of the LysG15, a lysin that contains a calcium-binding site near its active site. The authors determined the structures of its individual domains, LysG15-CHAP, LysG15-amidase-2, and LysG15-SH3b, using X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy. They found that the LysG15-CHAP domain contains a calcium-binding site near its active site, which is critical for its lytic activity. The calcium ion coordinates with residues D45, D47, Y49, and D56 via their side chains and main chains, respectively. The LysG15-CHAP domain is the most active domain, and the calcium ion is required for its bactericidal and cell wall hydrolytic activity. The LysG15-amidase-2 domain also contains a calcium-binding site and is able to enhance the activity of the LysG15-CHAP domain. The LysG15-SH3b domain does not demonstrate lytic activity but is necessary for high processivity. The authors propose that the calcium ion positions the key residues in the LysG15-CHAP domain to form the appropriate conformation and participates in catalytic activity. The calcium ion also helps position the LysG15-CHAP domain close to the peptidoglycan layer for efficient substrate binding. Overall, the calcium ion plays a critical role in the mechanism of action of LysG15, acting as a switch to modulate its activity between active and inactive states.
The paper investigates the role of Bap proteins in bacterial biofilm formation and how they mediate cell-cell interactions. Bap proteins are secreted and covalently anchored to the cell wall. When the pH of the environment decreases, the N-terminal domain of Bap is released and forms amyloid-like fibers that facilitate polymerization into amyloidogenic fibrils, allowing Bap to play a dual role in biofilm development. Calcium bound to EF-hand domains stabilizes the initial molten globule-like state, inhibiting amyloid assembly. The amyloid fibrils are highly stable and resistant to degradation, allowing them to form the biofilm matrix scaffold. The ability of Bap to fluctuate between soluble and amyloid-like states may be important for its physiological function in bacteria. The study shows that Bap orthologs in different bacteria species also utilize amyloid assembly as a mechanism to mediate multicellular behavior, indicating that this mechanism is conserved among coagulase-negative staphylococci. The amyloid fibrils of Bap also interact with the bacterial surface to induce cell-cell aggregation, mediating the initial biofilm formation. The results suggest that Bap amyloid fibers are important for the persistence of Staphylocococcus aureus in in infections, particularly in environments with acidic conditions, as the pH of the milk during lactation affects Bap functionality.
The paper describes a new framework for simultaneously modeling regulatory binding site evolution and multiple-sequence alignment. The framework uses phylogenetic pair hidden Markov models (PPHMMs) that can model different evolutionary changes in binding sites, such as gain and loss of function, and different nucleotide substitution biases. The PPHMMs can also model cross-functional states that are used to capture molecular homology and functional information. The authors show that their approach, MAFIA, outperforms other methods in predicting binding sites and aligning multiple sequences, especially when applied to real and simulated data. They demonstrate the benefits of their approach by applying it to a set of Drosophila developmental enhancers and showing that it can identify novel binding sites that are conserved across multiple genomes. The approach is flexible and can be extended to incorporate different models and parameters, which should improve predictive accuracy. The ability to align multiple genomes and simulate regulatory binding site evolution provides a powerful tool for studying the evolution of regulatory elements.
The paper describes a study that examines how humans adapt to familiar object dynamics. The authors use a state-space model to explain how humans adapt to familiar object dynamics, which is mediated by a single-rate process. In contrast, adaptation to novel dynamics is mediated by a dual-rate process. The study shows that familiar object dynamics is represented in multiple context-specific representations, which are selected based on visual context. When subjects adapt to familiar object dynamics, the representations are selectively engaged by visual information and are updated based on the dynamics of the specific object via a single-rate adaptation process. This is different from adaptation to novel dynamics, which requires a dual-rate process and is mediated by multiple context-specific representations selected based on kinematic context. The findings suggest that familiarity plays a key role in determining the rate of adaptation, with familiar dynamics being adapted more rapidly through a single-rate process. Overall, the study highlights the similarities and differences in the processes that mediate adaptation to familiar and novel dynamics, with familiarity being a key factor in determining the rapid adaptation of familiar object dynamics.
The paper discusses how microbial communities are diverse and how cross-feeding interactions between different microbial strains can contribute to this diversity. The authors propose a simple mathematical model of two strains that compete for a limiting resource and produce a secondary resource. They show how cross-feeding can arise in the model and maintain stability in certain environmental conditions. They argue that cross-feeding is not simply a function of resource concentration, but also depends on the rate-yield trade-off between the two strains and frequency of the competitors. The model shows complex dynamics with bi- and tri-stable steady states, and critical points. They suggest that cross-feeding interactions are common in simple environments, but density and frequency dependence play a key role in determining when they emerge and persist. They argue that cross-feeding is an important factor in promoting diversity in microbial communities and could contribute to genetic and phenotypic evolution, particularly in extreme environments. The model can be extended to study how cross-feeding interactions evolve over time and how they relate to other aspects of microbial diversity. The findings provide insights into how cross-feeding can promote diversity in microbial communities, including in tumors and chronic infections, and how mathematical models can help disentangle the complexities of cross-feeding interactions.
The paper presents a study evaluating different vaccine formulations and schedules for a recombinant Leishmania donovani A2 antigen in a non-human primate model of visceral leishmaniasis (VL). The study showed that vaccination with the A2 antigen, either as a protein, viral vector or DNA, elicited a specific antibody response in the monkeys. However, the level of antibody response was downregulated after infection. Vaccination with the A2 antigen in different formulations and schedules resulted in varying degrees of parasitological and clinical protection following infection, with the most effective vaccine formulation being a combination of DNA and adenovirus priming followed by alum boosting the A2 protein plus IL-12 cytokine. This resulted in lower parasite load, resolution of hepatic granulomas and clinical recovery. The study suggests that vaccine-induced cell-mediated immunity may play a role in controlling VL, although the level of protective immunity may depend on host genetics. The findings provide evidence that vaccines targeting A2 could potentially be a promising approach for controlling the disease, but more research is needed to identify the optimal combination of vaccine components and schedules.
The paper describes the role of the lipid metabolism regulating protein LKB1 and its downstream kinase SIK3 in maintaining lipid homeostasis in Drosophila. The authors show that LKB1 activates SIK3, which in turn regulates the lipolytic gene expression by controlling the nuclear localization of the deacetylase protein HDAC4. Under short-term fasting, the AKH pathway inhibits LKB1 activity and reduces SIK3 phosphorylation, which in turn reduces HDAC4 phosphorylation. However, under prolonged fasting, the AKH pathway is less effective, and the LKB1-SIK3-HDAC4 pathway becomes the primary lipolytic signaling pathway. The authors also show that LKB1 is necessary for maintaining lipid homeostasis in Drosophila, and that the LKB1-SIK3 pathway is conserved in mammals, raising questions about its potential role in obesity-related metabolic diseases. The study demonstrates that LKB1 and SIK3 are important regulators of lipid metabolism in insects and mammals, highlighting the potential importance of understanding the evolutionary conserved mechanisms of lipid homeostasis.
The paper presents a novel method for refining the atomic resolution structure of membrane proteins in different states using information from a variety of biophysical and biochemical experiments. The method involves introducing non-interacting molecular fragments, represented with atomic details, into molecular dynamics simulations. Each molecular fragment corresponds to a specific structural restraint derived from a biophysical or biochemical experiment, such as a metal ion bridge or spin-label. The fragments are anchored to the protein via their overlapping backbone atoms, while interactions between different fragments are avoided. The method was tested on the voltage-sensing domain (VSD) of the Kv1.2 channel, where different sets of structural restraints were applied to generate multiple models of the VSD in the resting state. The results showed that the different models could satisfy all the experimental restraints simultaneously without significant conformational changes to the protein backbone. The method was also applied to incorporate DEER distance histograms, which could not be resolved in unbiased simulations. The authors propose that the non-interacting molecular fragments enable efficient generation of 3D structural models that satisfy multiple experimental constraints, and their molecular fragment method is compatible with mean-field reMD simulations. The method provides a convenient and efficient way to refine protein structures based on multiple experimental constraints.
The paper investigated the relationship between blood group antigens and susceptibility to Vibrio cholerae in Bangladesh. They found that individuals with the Lewis blood group (Le(a+b−) phenotype were more likely to get symptomatic cholera compared to the other two groups, suggesting that this blood group may be associated with an increased risk of colonization or becoming symptomatic. Individuals with the Le(a–b+) phenotype required less intravenous fluids following hospitalization, indicating that this phenotype was associated with a milder form of the disease. They also found that individuals with the Le(a–b−) phenotype had reduced IgA responses to LPS compared to the other groups, which may be related to their longer duration of diarrhea. The study suggests that the Lewis blood group antigens may play a role in susceptibility to cholera, although the reasons behind this association are not yet defined. The distribution of Lewis blood group phenotypes in Bangladesh was different from that in non-endemic areas, but similar to areas where cholera is endemic. The findings suggest that the Lewis blood group antigens may be a factor that could affect vaccine efficacy in different settings.
The paper describes a chemical genomic screen to identify genes that are involved in buffering the toxic effects of 1-hexadecyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (C16:0PAF), a lipid species that is elevated in Alzheimer's disease and associated with accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) oligomers. The screen identified the gene Srf1 as being highly sensitive to C16:0PAF, and further investigation revealed that Srf1 physically interacts with Spo14, a protein involved in phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis. Deletion of Srf1 resulted in increased sensitivity to C16:0PAF, indicating that Srf1 is required for buffering its toxic effects. The authors propose that Srf1 regulates Spo14 activity, possibly by a complex formed between the two proteins. They found that Spo14 is delocalized from the plasma membrane upon C16:0PAF treatment, which suggests that the localized generation of phosphatidylcholine may be required to buffer the toxic effects of C16:0PAF. The study suggests that the role of phosphatidylcholine-lysis in buffering C16:0PAF toxicity is conserved across species and may be a potential therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease.
This paper describes a high-throughput screen to identify genetic mutations that affect the intracellular localization of the group II intron-encoded reverse transcriptase LtrA. The authors used a mariner transposon-insertion library to identify mutants that accumulate polyphosphate, which in turn leads to the delocalization of LtrA from the cell poles. They found that LtrA localization is a major determinant of LtrA insertion site preference in E. coli. The authors identified five genes whose disruption leads to diffuse LtrA localization: gppA, uhpT, wcaK, ynbC, zntR and ppx. These genes encode guanosine pentaphosphatase, hexose transport component, 585-amino-acid ORF, and zinc-responsive transcription factor, respectively. Polyphosphate accumulation was shown to affect the localization of LtrA and other basic proteins, and the authors propose that it binds LtrA directly. The results suggest that polyphosphate accumulation may be a cellular mechanism that relocalizes basic proteins in response to cellular stress or entry into stationary phase. The findings provide insight into how LtrA insertion sites are determined and how intracellular localization affects LtrA function. The methodology described could be used to identify genetic factors that affect protein localization in other organisms.
This paper uses the zebrafish model to study the role of septins in controlling Shigella infection. The authors found that zebrafish septins restrict inflammation and are required for neutrophil-mediated immunity. Injecting a morpholino against septin 1 (Sept15) resulted in increased susceptibility to Shigella infection, as neutrophils were unable to clear the bacteria and died upon infection. Injecting anakinra, an IL-1R antagonist, rescued neutrophils and larvae from septin depletion, reducing mortality upon infection. The authors suggest that septins interact with components of the inflammasome and regulate assembly of this multiprotein complex. They propose that targeting the cytoskeleton could represent an anti-inflammatory strategy to dampen inflammation. Overall, the results suggest that septins play a key role in controlling inflammation and neutrophil clearance during Shigella infection.
The paper examines the relationship between the time it takes for Buruli ulcer patients to seek medical care and the severity of their disease. The study found that younger patients, particularly those under 15 years old, tend to seek medical care more quickly, while older patients and those with ulcerated lesions tend to delay seeking care more. However, the paper also found that time-delays were not significantly associated with more severe forms of the disease, such as multifocal lesions, larger lesions or WHO category 3 lesions. This suggests that factors related to the patient's immune response and disease progression, rather than access to care, may be the main drivers of the differences in seeking medical care. The findings highlight the importance of early diagnosis and treatment for the most severe forms of Buruli ulcer, and suggest that public health interventions aimed at improving access to care may need to focus on specific patient groups, such as children and older patients.
The paper describes a cross-sectional study of 86 working dogs from three kennels in Texas to determine the prevalence of Chagas disease in working dogs. The researchers found that 57.6% of the dogs were seropositive for Trypanosoma cruzi, with 17.4% harboring parasite DNA in their blood. The majority of infected dogs were older, indicating ongoing transmission within the kennels. The researchers also found that Triatoma gerstaeckeri bugs, which are known vectors of the parasite, were more likely to harbor the TcI strain, while Triatoma sanguisuga bugs were more likely to harbor the TcIV strain. The study highlights the importance of vector control and kennel management to prevent transmission of Chagas disease in working dogs, as they are highly trained and valuable for various tasks. The findings suggest that dogs in kennels serve as a key reservoir for the parasite and are likely the primary source of infection for other dogs within the kennels. The study suggests that serological and molecular techniques have limitations and imperfect sensitivity and specificity, and further research is needed to better understand Chagas disease in dogs, including congenital transmission and the role of sexual transmission.
The paper presents a theoretical model to study the competition between different sigma factors that regulate gene expression in bacteria. The model describes the interaction between sigma factors and core RNA polymerase, including binding to promoters, transcription initiation and elongation, and non-specific binding to DNA. The authors use the model to analyze experimental data on the formation of holoenzymes (sigma factor-RNA polymerase complexes) and transcription rates. They find that when sigma factors are in excess of core RNA polymerase, the transcription of genes dependent on the alternative sigma factors is hypersensitive to changes in core availability, indicating that passive up-regulation of these genes can occur during stress responses. However, non-specific binding of core RNA polymerase to DNA does not buffer against the release of core RNA polymerases from ribosomal RNA operons during the stringent response, leading to an amplification of passive up-regulation. The authors suggest that anti-sigma factors may play a key role in tuning the system to work within the competition regime and sequestering housekeeping sigma factors. The model provides insights into the passive regulation of alternative sigma factor-dependent transcription during stress responses and the role of sigma factors in synthetic gene circuits.
The paper discusses the mechanism by which a chromatin remodeling enzyme called NoRC positions nucleosomes on DNA. The enzyme is shown to require linker DNA, but not the nucleosome core, for efficient binding and remodeling activity. It binds with high affinity to nucleosomes positioned at "wrong" sites, which are later remodeled to the correct position. This suggests that NoRC positions nucleosomes according to the release model, where it binds high affinity to initial wrong positions and then remodels the nucleosome until it reaches the correct position. The enzyme's low affinity for the remodeled nucleosome is the substrate. The results show that NoRC recognizes structured DNA sequences in the rRNA gene promoter, which serve as positioning signals, allowing it to position the nucleosome. The pRNA molecule competes with nucleosomes for binding to NoRC, specifically inhibiting its ATPase activity, and serves as a tether, tethering the nucleosome to the promoter. The pRNA also recruits DNA methyltransferases and histone modifiers to silence the rRNA gene. The paper argues that chromatin remodeling enzymes, like NoRC, position nucleosomes according to the release model, where they bind high affinity to initial wrong positions and then remodel to the correct position. This allows them to organize chromatin structure with respect to the underlying DNA sequence. The combinatorial aspect of chromatin remodeling enzymes and their constitution determines chromatin architecture and regulatory sequences.
The paper describes a chemical genomics screen of Escherichia coli to identify determinants of resistance to antibiotics with poorly characterized modes of action. The screen identified that the peptide ABC-importers oligopeptide permease (Opp) and dipeptide permease (Dpp) import the antibiotics kasugamycin (Ksg) and blasticin S (BcS) through illicit transport. The peptide ABC-importers Opp and Dpp have multiple substrate binding sites, allowing them to import different antibiotics. The authors showed that deleting these ABC-importers results in resistance to both Ksg and BcS. The mechanism of resistance involves the import of Ksg through both Opp and Dpp, while BcS is imported through Opp alone. The screen also identified that growth at 10°C resulted in sensitivity to antibiotics, and the deletion of genes involved in drug efflux and translation were correlated with sensitivity to Ksg and BcS. The study demonstrates that the peptide ABC-importers Opp and Dpp play a key role in importing antibiotics through illicit transport, and that the shared uptake mechanism is likely conserved across different pathogens. The results provide a valuable resource for identifying new determinants of resistance to less studied antibiotics and for predicting how loss of uptake will impact resistance in agricultural and medical settings.
The paper provides an overview of the epidemiology of rabies in Kazakhstan based on surveillance data from 2003-2015. It finds that animal rabies cases were most commonly reported in cattle (50%), followed by dogs (19.7%), wild carnivores (16.8%), and other species (0.6%). There were distinct clusters of outbreaks in southern and northern regions. While vaccination efforts have been implemented, there has been no reduction in the number of areas reporting rabies cases in farm animals or the total number of cases. The study estimates that 36-7 human rabies cases occurred per year, resulting in 14 deaths and 3857 bite injuries requiring post-exposure prophylaxis. The cost per case averted was estimated at $7608-1950. The paper also found that vaccinating farm livestock does not prevent transmission and targeting vaccination of dogs and foxes may be more cost effective. The study concludes that while vaccination efforts have had some success in preventing human deaths, more targeted vaccination of reservoir hosts is needed to eliminate rabies in Kazakhstan.
The paper describes a mouse model that recapitulates human infant susceptibility to Streptococococcus pneumoniae colonization. Infected mice have delayed macrophage recruitment during colonization, which correlates with elevated baseline macrophage chemoattractant expression and persistent colonization. The authors found that the infant microbiota contributes to tonic macrophage chemoattractant expression, which in turn partially restores macrophage recruitment and clearance of colonization. They found that baseline macrophage chemoattractant levels were elevated in infant mice, which was dependent on the presence of the microbiota. This was not seen in germ-free mice. Inducing a gradient of macrophage chemoattractant CCL2 in the infant upper respiratory tract partially rescued the defect in macrophage recruitment. The study suggests that altered monocyte/macrophage trafficking and CCL2 signals may be an important mechanism for infant susceptibility to encapsulated bacteria like S. pneumoniae.
The paper describes the construction and characterization of soluble CD4+ TCR tetramers that can specifically detect and quantify antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in patients with active tuberculosis (TB). The tetramers were constructed by cloning CD4+ TCR α and β chains from peptide-responsive CD4+ T cells and expressing them in insect cells. The tetramers were able to bind to different HLA-DR molecules, indicating that the CD4+ TCRs are highly specific and diverse. The tetramers were used to detect and quantify MTB-specific APCs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBL) and tissue sections from TB patients. The results showed that there were relatively low levels of MTB-specific monocytes in the circulation of advanced and untreated TB patients, which was likely due to the local recruitment, focus and apoptosis of APCs. The study demonstrated the diagnostic potential of MTB-specific CD4+ TCR tetramers and provided insights into the mechanisms of antigen presentation and the relationship with TB infection. The authors also found that the quantity of MTB-specific monocytes increased during the first month of anti-TB treatment, likely due to the clearance of bacteria and the activation of CD4+ T cells. The study provides a valuable tool for monitoring changes in APCs during TB infection and latent TB infection, which could be used to develop revolutionary immunotherapies.
The paper discusses how the Trypanosoma cruzi parasite, which causes Chagas disease, has an important mechanism for repairing oxidative DNA damage caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during its life cycle. The parasite lacks a MutT enzyme, which is needed to hydrolyze 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG), a common oxidized nucleotide. The authors created a T. cruzi cell line that expresses the E. coli MutT enzyme to test how this heterologous expression affects the parasite's ability to cope with oxidative stress. They found that MutT-expressing parasites were more resistant to hydrogen peroxide treatment and had lower levels of oxidized nucleotides in their DNA compared to non-expressing parasites. This suggests that the expression of MutT allows the parasite to better handle oxidative stress and enables it to replicate faster. They also found that T. cruzi has a potential MutT homolog (TcMTH), which when overexpressed, further enhances the parasite's resistance to oxidative stress and allows it to replicate more quickly inside host cells. This study suggests that the ability to repair oxidative DNA damage may be important for the parasite's viability, particularly in its replicative phases, and that mechanisms for counteracting oxidative stress could be a potential target for drug development against Chagas disease.
This paper investigates the genomic regulatory structures underlying the different functional states of human keratinocytes, including progenitor cells, differentiating cells, and migrating cells. The researchers used ChIP-seq and siRNA knockdowns to identify enhancers and super-enhancers (SEs) in progenitor, differentiating, and migrating keratinocytes. They found that different transcription factors regulate these genomic structures in distinct ways depending on the cell state. For example, the factor GRHL3 primarily binds SEs in differentiating keratinocytes, while it binds proximal promoters in migrating keratinocytes. The researchers also found that the formation of SEs is repressed by GRHL3 in migrating keratinocytes. SNPs associated with skin diseases are overrepresented in SEs and genes encoding transcriptional regulators of keratinocyte differentiation. These findings suggest that SEs play a key role in stabilizing functional states and regulating gene expression. The results provide new insights into how a single transcription factor like GRHL3 can control distinct gene expression programs under different physiological states within a cell type. The study demonstrates that regulation of keratinocyte function involves complex interactions between chromatin and transcription factors acting at specific time points during transition processes.
The paper discusses the role of the E6 protein in maintaining high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) genomes as extrachromosomal nuclear plasmids in normal immortalized keratinocytes (NIKS). The authors found that E6 is required for the establishment and maintenance of HPV16 genomes as extrachromosomal nuclear plasmids, and that inactivation of the tumor suppressor protein p53 is sufficient to support maintenance of HPV16, HPV31 and HPV18 genomes in the absence of E6. They identified two E6 mutants that were able to inactivate p53, the E6I28T mutant which lacks the pDZ binding domain, and E6Δ146-151 mutant which lacks the pDZ binding domain. The E6 mutants were able to attenuate a p53-dependent G1/S growth arrest and inhibit p53-dependent transactivation. The results suggest that inactivation of p53 is necessary and sufficient for maintenance of HPV16 genomes, but additional functions of E6 may also contribute to maintenance of HPV16. The study also found that the PDZ binding domain of E6 is not required for stable maintenance of HPV16. The authors propose that inactivation of p53 may reactivate p53-mediated interferon signaling, which inhibits HPV replication, and that E6 may inactivate p53 to abrogate DNA damage responses and interferon signaling. The study suggests that drugs that reactivate p53 could be effective at eliminating persistent high-risk HPV infections and reducing the risk of HPV-associated cancers in infected patients.
This paper investigates the role of the Arabidopsis protein POT1a in maintaining telomeres. POT1a was found to directly interact with the telomerase subunit TER1 and stimulate its activity, but was not required for the association of telomerase with telomeres. Instead, POT1a was found to be necessary for the synthesis of long telomere repeat arrays, indicating that it promotes the switch from an unextendable to extendable state by stimulating telomerase enzyme activity. In S phase, POT1a recruits telomerase to the G-overhang through unknown mechanism and associates with CTC1 and STN1. Once the G-strand is extended, telomerase activity is terminated, likely with the assistance of the telomerase negative regulator TEN1. The dynamic interactions between POT1a and CST are likely governed by cell cycle-specific post-translational modifications. Overall, the data suggest that POT1a facilitates telomere maintenance by promoting the switch from the unextendable to the extendable state and by stimulating telomerase activity, but not by recruiting telomerase to the telomere.
The paper describes experiments to determine the temporal effects of blocking type I interferon signaling on West Nile virus (WNV) infection. The authors used an anti-IFNAR antibody that blocked intracellular signaling to evaluate the effects of blocking type I interferon signaling at different stages of infection. They found that blocking type I interferon signaling at day 4 after infection resulted in dysfunctional CD8+ T cell responses, characterized by reduced intracellular cytokine production, altered surface expression of exhaustion markers, and an exhausted phenotype. In contrast, blocking type I interferon signaling at an earlier stage, day 2, resulted in increased viral burden and enhanced CD8+ T cell priming. These results suggest that later blockade of type I interferon signaling primarily affects CD8+ T cell maturation, while earlier blockade enhances CD8+ T cell priming. The study suggests that the timing of blocking type I interferon signaling may be important for controlling the development and function of CD8+ T cells during in the context of viral infection.
The paper identifies a protein called PRL1 as a key regulator of miRNA accumulation in Arabidopsis thaliana. PRL1 positively regulates the levels of miRNAs by stabilizing pri-miRNAs and promoting their processing. The study shows that PRL1 interacts with the DCL1 complex and the mediator complex, which is required for miRNA transcription, and is required for the accumulation of miRNAs. Loss of PRL1 reduces pri-miRNA levels, indicating that PRL1 acts as a co-factor for DCL1 activity. The authors propose that PRL1 may act as an accessory factor for DCL1 to facilitate its activity, and that PRL1 and CDC5 act together to promote miRNA maturation. However, PRL1 does not positively regulate MIR transcription. The study also shows that PRL1 interacts with pri-miRNAs in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that PRL1 may stabilize pri-miRNAs. The authors propose that PRL1 acts as a co-factor for CDC5 in the miRNA pathway, possibly by promoting DCL1 activity. The study suggests that PRL1 plays an important role in promoting miRNA maturation and stabilizing pri-miRNAs, which contributes to the observed phenotypes in the prl1 mutants.
The paper presents evidence that neurons in the secondary auditory area NCM of zebra Finches are able to recognize songs embedded in noise, even though the noise has a different spectral power spectrum than the song. The authors used electrophysiology recordings from 50 neurons in NCM and found that some neurons showed remarkable resistance to noise degradation, while others showed significant degradation. The authors analyzed the spectral and temporal properties of the neurons and found that those with longer integration times and higher modulation tuning were more noise-invariant. They developed an algorithm that uses a modulation filter bank like the neurons found in NCM to filter out noise and recover the original song. The algorithm performed well compared to existing noise reduction methods. The results suggest that noise-invariant neurons are an important aspect of song recognition and that modulation filtering in the modulation domain is effective for separating signal from noise. The authors propose that the noise-invariant property of neurons is likely due to a series of computations that occur along the auditory processing stream.
The paper describes the discovery of a non-canonical F-box protein, AnkB, in Legionella pneumophila, which is essential for intracellular proliferation within both mammalian and protozoan cells. AnkB mimics evolutionarily conserved F-box proteins in exploiting a conserved polyubiquitination machinery within evolutionarily distant hosts. AnkB's F-box domain interacts with the host protein SKP1 and is essential for recruiting polyubiquinated proteins to the L. pneumophila vacuole. This interaction is required for intracellular proliferation within mammalian macrophages and protozoa. The F-box domain of AnkB is structurally novel compared to other F-box proteins and exhibits molecular and functional mimicry of eukaryotic F-box proteins. The AnkB-SKP1 interaction is specific and essential for intracellular proliferation, indicating AnkB interacts with the host polyubiquitination machinery. The paper provides evidence that AnkB is a novel example of a bacterial non-canonical F-box protein that exploits evolutionarily conserved cellular processes to enable intracellular proliferation within evolutionarily distant hosts. The study proposes a model where AnkB interacts with SKP1 and recruits polyubiquinated proteins to the vacuole. Further work is needed to identify the substrates of AnkB and other components of the polyubiquitination machinery. The findings suggest that AnkB's ability to exploit host processes allows Legionella pneumophila to infect and cause disease in mammals.
The paper describes a statistical simulation study aimed at identifying best practices for metagenome annotation to maximize accuracy of gene family abundance estimates. The authors used a simulation framework to evaluate how different translation methods, gene prediction tools, homology algorithms, and annotation parameters impact accuracy. They found that: 1) Translation methods like 6FT and ab initio gene prediction with per-ORF annotation are optimal for short reads, while per-read annotation is better for longer reads. 2) A precise bit-score threshold is important for short reads, while a more lenient or strict threshold works for longer reads. 3) Sequencing error rate has little impact on accuracy. 4) Optimal thresholds are generally stable across different conditions. 5) A minimum of 1 million reads is needed for accurate within-sample family abundance estimates, while deeper sequencing is required for accurate between-sample estimates. The authors developed an end-to-end annotation workflow called Shotgun Metagenome Annotation Pipeline (ShotMAP) to apply these best practices to previously published metagenomes and identify novel biomarkers for disease. By analyzing previously published datasets, they found that annotation decisions can significantly impact results and interpretation. The study demonstrates that choosing appropriate parameters during metagenome annotation can improve accuracy and identify meaningful biomarkers.
The paper proposes a new method called ClassTR to classify complex bacterial infections into clonal or mixed origins based on MLVA data. The current method is based on a parsimony assumption and an integer programming optimization problem to resolve complex strains into simple strains. ClassTR uses a model of tandem repeat evolution to classify complex strains as either clonal or mixed based on the similarity of their predecessor sets of simple strains. ClassTR resolves the complex strains into simple strains using a linear programming formulation and then uses the Jaccard index to classify the complex strains as clonal or mixed based on the similarity of their predecessor sets. ClassTR outperforms the standard rule-based method in classifying complex infections, especially at higher mutation rates. The method provides probabilistic classifications and can identify the constituent strains within mixed infections. The authors argue that future modifications to their model, such as accounting for duplication events, could improve its accuracy. The approach has the potential to advance our understanding of within-host heterogeneity in tuberculosis and other bacteria.
This paper investigated how Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection represses the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim in infected B cells. The authors found that EBV infection leads to a significant down-regulation of Bim mRNA levels and protein, which does not appear to depend on changes in Bim protein stability or ERK phosphorylation. They concluded that EBV primarily regulates Bim expression by reducing the rate of transcription through epigenetic mechanisms, specifically by reducing the acetylation of histones H3 and H4. EBV infection leads to reduced acetylation of histones H3 and H4, which makes the unusually large CpG island associated with the Bim promoter available for DNA methylation. The authors propose that EBV uses histone methyltransferases (HMTs) to induce the H3K27-Me3 mark on Bim, which then creates a substrate for DNA methylation. This epigenetic repression is likely initiated by the actions of EBNA3A and EBNA3C, which activate Myc, which would otherwise induce increased Bim and apoptosis. The initial epigenetic marks on Bim make the CpG island available for DNA methylation, which is then reinforced through continuous selection pressure in progeny cells. The authors suggest that EBV encodes no DNMTs but interactions between EBV factors and cellular DNMTs may be involved in the targeted repression of Bim. The study suggests that epigenetic modification of the host genome by latent viruses during disease pathogenesis may be a common feature.
The paper describes the development and properties of functional networks in cultures of cortical neurons grown in vitro. The authors use graph-theoretic analysis and complex network metrics to quantify the properties of the networks. They find that the cultures exhibit non-random properties such as a small-world topology, which supports efficient information transfer. The network properties evolve over time from a random initial topology at younger ages to a small-world topology at older ages, driven by the maturation of the excitatory-inhibitory balance and increased synchronization. The small-world networks have highly connected areas and the ability for any two areas to interact via few intermediate connections. The results indicate that burst propagation times are reduced with culture maturation, suggesting the networks are more efficient. The presence of hubs with high persistence suggests the existence of influential nodes and links. The study demonstrates that functional networks can evolve in vitro in a small-world topology, indicating that experiments requiring complex network properties should be undertaken at later ages of culture development. The findings provide a benchmark against which to assess the influence of closed-loop stimulation on culture network properties. The authors propose that frequently activated nodes may play a role in coordinating synchrony between segregated clusters. The study highlights the importance of staining and pharmacological manipulation to elucidate the underlying mechanisms.
The paper explores the role of sexual and asexual reproduction in shaping mycotoxin diversity in Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasicus, two important fungal colonizers of crops and foods. The study finds that sexual reproduction tends to create novel mycotoxin chemotypes, while asexual reproduction fixes existing toxin chemotypes in populations. The proportion of sexual to asexual reproduction in a population is a good predictor of the diversity of mycotoxin chemotypes. Predominantly asexual populations have lower mean recombination rates in the aflatoxin gene and more non-aflatoxigenic clones, while predominantly sexual populations have higher mean recombination rates and more recombination hotspots. The results suggest that the degree of sexuality in a population can be used to fine-tune biocontrol strategies for reducing aflatoxin contamination in crops. Predominantly asexual populations may be better suited to using non-flatoxigenic isolates as biocontrol agents, while predominantly sexual populations may be better suited to using flatoxigenic isolates with high potential to recombine with existing toxin producers. The study highlights the importance of understanding population genetics and reproductive dynamics in controlling aflatoxin diversity in fungi to improve biocontrol.
The paper discusses the mechanisms by which environmental stress conditions reduce cell viability and maintain cellular homeostasis through dynamic regulation of metabolic activities, including translation. The authors investigate the effect of oxidative stress on tRNAs, which are translationally competent RNAs that are rapidly degraded by an endonuclease called angiogenin. They find that exposure to oxidative stress rapidly deactivates the 3'CCA termini of all tRNAs, leading to a global repression of translation at the level of elongation. This degradation is reversible and quickly repairable by the CCA-adding enzyme. They propose that the 3'CCA ends are targeted by angiogenin to rapidly repress translation during stress, while the cleavage in the anticodon loop occurs on a slower timescale and is specific for a subset of tRNAs, generating tiRNAs that can modulate translation of specific mRNAs. The authors show that the deactivation of 3'CCA ends is a mechanism to dynamically repress translation at low metabolic costs. They also find that exposure to acute oxidative stress inhibits translation initiation through eIF2α phosphorylation, while moderate stress selectively represses cap-dependent translation. The results suggest that the degradation of 3'CCA ends is an important mechanism for selectively reprogramming protein synthesis during stress.
The paper investigates the role of the DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor in the innate immune response of Caenorhabditis elegans to fungal infection and physical injury. The authors find that DAF-16 is directly involved in the epidermis in controlling immune responses to fungal infection and physical injury. They identify a novel signaling pathway that is independent of the DAF-2 insulin-like signaling pathway, whereby ROS production mediated by BLI-3 in the epidermis activates DAF-16. The production of ROS is required for the activation of DAF-16, which in turn is essential for resistance to fungal infection and physical injury. The study proposes that DAF-16 could be a novel target for treating epidermal damage. The authors propose a model whereby the evolutionarily conserved MST/CST pathway functions in parallel with the insulin signaling pathway to regulate DAF-16 through oxidative stress. The findings suggest that FOXOs are involved in epidermal innate immunity in various species, including humans, and that DAF-16 could be a potential target for treating epidermal damage.
This paper investigates the role of histone methylation in the fungus Magnaporta oryzae. The authors identify eight histone methyltransferases in the genome and examine their roles in in in regulating gene expression during infection. They find that the histone methyltransferase MoSET1 is most important for in regulating gene expression during in Magnaporta oryza. They use a split-marker gene disruption strategy to delete genes for the histone methyltransferases and examine their effects on fungal growth, appressium formation, conidiation and pathogenicity on host plants. They find that loss of MoSET1 leads to reduced appressium formation, germination, vegetative growth and pathogenicity. They also find that MoSET1 regulates genes involved in cAMP signaling pathway and cell wall degradation. They conclude that MoSET1 plays a key role in regulating gene expression during in Magnaporta oryza infection.
The paper proposes a new approach to controlling African trypanosomiasis, a disease transmitted by tsetse insects, by using Wolbachia bacteria to induce cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) in the tset population. The authors develop a mathematical model that combines population genetics of Wolbachia in tset with a dynamic model of trypanosome transmission. They show that a one-time release of Wolbachia-colonized tset, provided the CI is effective at protecting against trypanosome transmission and the target tset species comprises the majority of the tset population, can eliminate trypanosomias. The size of the release determines how quickly elimination occurs, with a larger release achieving faster elimination. The authors also find that imperfect immunity by Wolbachia-colonized tset does not significantly impact the dynamics of trypanosomias among tset, but does reduce prevalence. They conclude that paratransgenesis has the potential to be a feasible strategy to control trypanosomias rapidly, but effectiveness may wane over time and would require large-scale colony breeding of paratransgeneic tset.
This paper presents the first characterization of a genetic interaction network in a multicellular organism, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, composed of 150 genetic interactions (GIs). The authors identify six classes of GIs, named C1 to C6, based on their properties when considering expression, protein-protein interaction, and phenotype data. The C1 class is enriched in genes involved in cell division, while C2 and C3 are enriched in genes interacting through between protein-protein interactions, suggesting that they are PDS-centric. C4 and C5 GIs are enriched in genes interacting within protein-protein interaction dense subnetworks and are PDS-independent, respectively. C6 GIs are enriched in pleiotropic connectors, while C3 GIs are non-pleiotropic connectors. The study shows that different classes of GIs coordinate molecular machines within biological processes in different ways, with PDS-centric and PDS-independent GIs contributing to pathways. The authors propose a model where PDS-centric and PDS-independent interactions coordinate molecular machines together with pleiotropic and non-pleiotropic connectors. The study demonstrates the value of integrative genomics approaches using data from different abstraction levels to characterize genetic interaction networks and their relationship to biological processes, providing insights into the structure and function of genetic interaction networks in multicellular organisms.
The paper describes an analysis of genome-wide DNA methylation variation in five different human cell types. The authors identified regions of the genome where methylation levels vary across individuals in a coordinated manner, termed "Variably Methylated Regions" or VMRs. These VMRs were found to be enriched for functional genomic features such as enhancers and were co-regulated across cell types, indicating they may play a role in regulating gene expression. The authors found that some VMRs were influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, and were associated with known genes involved in cell-type specific functions. They also found that a subset of VMRs were responsive to environmental stimuli, such as nutrient availability or cell density. The authors propose a model where coordinated variation of DNA methylation across multiple loci in trans is under the control of transcription factors responding to physiological and environmental cues. This study provides insights into the nature and function of epigenetic variation and highlights the dynamic interface between genome and environment.
The paper investigates the effects of a gradual dopamine lesion on cognitive control and performance monitoring in rhesus macaque monkeys. The monkeys learned a problem-solving task that required them to search for and exploit reward possibilities. The task induced a dopamine lesion through a slow progressive MPTP protocol, which resulted in a gradual emergence of dopamine loss. The researchers recorded ECoG signals to analyze the FRPs and beta oscillations during the task, which reflected the monkeys' cognitive control and motivation. The FRPs were found to be significantly attenuated at the full dose of MPTP, indicating a loss of performance monitoring. However, the monkeys still performed the task optimally, indicating that cognitive control was maintained. The researchers found that the beta oscillations continued to represent cognitive control throughout the MPTP period, indicating that a compensatory mechanism was at work. The paper argues that the FRPs were not a direct product of dopamine prediction in the MCC, but rather a marker of the dopamine lesion. The attenuation of FRPs and continued representation of cognitive control in beta oscillations suggest that the MCC reorganized to provide information to the control system, even after the FRP signal was lost. The PET scans showed increased DAT binding in the striatum and cingulate cortex, consistent with compensatory changes. The results suggest that the dopamine lesion impacts the potential biomarker of performance monitoring, but does not directly drive the actual trial-by-trial adaptations, which are mediated by the striatum. The study demonstrates the importance of combining lesion studies with neurophysiology to understand the complex relationships between dopamine, motivation, and cognitive control.
This paper investigated the role of the DNA ligase IV protein Dnl4 in repairing double-strand breaks in the yeast species Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The researchers created mutant forms of Dnl4 that had defects in specific steps of the ATP-dependent ligation mechanism and tested their ability to repair double-strand breaks. They found that even catalytically defective Dnl4 proteins could still support residual non-homologous end joining, but that this was less mutagenic than proper c-NHEJ catalyzed by wild-type Dnl4. The study suggests that Dnl4 protein likely promotes the assembly of the c-NHEJ complex at the break site, which is then used by multiple ligases, including the catalytically ineffective Dnl4 mutants, to repair the break. The results also suggest that residual repair is influenced by the cell's metabolic state, and that 5' resection is not inhibited by the presence of Dnl4 at the break. The findings provide insights into the role of DNA ligase IV in double-strand break repair and may have implications for understanding human DNA ligase IV syndrome, where mutations in the protein can lead to genetic mutations.
The paper explores the relationship between leprosy and migration in Maranhão, Brazil. The study found that past five year migration was significantly associated with leprosy diagnosis, even after controlling for household and close family contact. The majority of migrants were diagnosed with multibacillary leprosy, which suggests a longer exposure to index patients. The close family and household contact were the most significant factors associated with leprosy among migrants. Migration was largely facilitated through family networks, so contact surveillance should include migration site residence as well as current residence contacts. Migration was found to be more common within Maranhão and neighboring states, indicating a need for monitoring of intra- and inter-state migration to identify emerging endemic areas. Alcohol consumption was also found to be associated with leprosy, which could affect transmission and treatment outcomes. The social determinants of health, including socioeconomic status and past five year alcohol consumption, were significantly different between migrants with leprosy and the control group. The study suggests that monitoring migration patterns and contact surveillance can provide early warning systems for localized disease control.
The paper proposes a new method called prepaid estimation that can significantly speed up the process of parameter estimation for complex models that have no analytical likelihood. The key idea is to generate a comprehensive and one-shot database of parameter values that can be used to estimate model parameters for any data set, with little additional computational effort. The prepaid database is created by simulating a large number of data sets across the entire parameter space and then compressing the summary statistics. This allows for fast interpolation methods to be used on the prepaid database to estimate parameters for any data set. The paper demonstrates the efficacy of this approach by applying it to three realistic models: the Ricker model, a community dynamics model, and an elementary decision making model. The prepaid method is shown to be at least as accurate as current methods but much faster, allowing for extensive testing of parameter recovery across the entire parameter space. The paper also discusses limitations and potential future directions, including improving the construction of the prepaid database, choosing summary statistics, and extending the method to multilevel contexts. Overall, the paper shows how prepaid estimation can democratize the use of computationally expensive models and impact the workflow of scientific modeling.
The paper describes a screening approach using the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans to identify chemicals that enhance the activity of the nematicide aldicarb against nematodes. Al dicarb is a nematicide that has been shown to be effective against nematodes but has toxic effects on mammals. The authors screened a library of 638 compounds that inhibit acetylcholinesterase, the target of aldicarb, to identify compounds that enhance its activity without increasing toxicity. They identified 20 compounds that interact with aldicarb and reduced nematode growth when combined with the nematicide. One of the identified compounds, wact-86, was found to be metabolized by the carboxylesterase enzyme GES-1, which is responsible for metabolizing aldicarb. The authors showed that the GES-1 mutants were resistant to wact-86, suggesting that GES-1 metabolism confers resistance to the compound. The results suggest that GES-1 metabolism is the likely mechanism by which wact-86 interacts with aldicarb and enhances its nematic activity. The study provides proof-of-principle that C. elegans can be used as a model to identify new chemical enhancers of existing nematicides and to circumvent their toxicity.
The paper presents evidence that chlamydial bacteria, specifically Parachlamydaemia amoebophila, have metabolic activity in their extracellular infectious stage, the EB, which is linked to their survival and infectivity. Previous studies assumed that the EB stage was metabolically inert. The authors show that EBs can take up and metabolize the carbon source D-glucose, which is essential for their survival. They demonstrate that the availability of D-glucose in the host-free environment affects the survival of infectious EBs and that EBs are metabolically active during host-free incubation. They also show that EBs can synthesize and catabolize metabolites in host-free incubation, indicating that they have anabolic as well as catabolic reactions. This challenges the current view that the infective stage of chlamydiae is metabolically inert and provides insights into the metabolism of the EB stage. The findings imply that the environment plays a key role in the biology of the infective stage and that the detection of metabolic activity in EBs is relevant for their infectivity. The study provides a detailed analysis of the central carbon metabolism of P. amoebophila EBs using mass spectrometry and ICR/FT-MS.
The paper compares the effectiveness of intermittent screening and treatment with artemether-lumefantrine (ISTp) versus intermittent preventive treatment with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPTp) in pregnant women in an area with high levels of malaria transmission and resistance to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP). The study found that ISTp was not superior to IPTp in preventing adverse birth outcomes, such as low birthweight, preterm birth and fetal loss, despite ISTp being able to detect and treat malaria infections more effectively. While ISTp was associated with a higher incidence of clinical malaria at delivery, the difference in malaria risk at delivery was modest. The study suggests that the continued effectiveness of IPTp may be due to its frequent dosing regimen, which helps mitigate the shortening of post-treatment prophylaxis caused by SP resistance. The lack of superiority of ISTp may also be due to the failure to detect low-level parasitemias and the infrequent screening in a high transmission setting, allowing new infections to develop between scheduled visits. The broad antimicrobial effect of IPTp may also reduce the risk of fetal loss relative to ISTp. While ISTp was well tolerated, the excess risk of fetal loss observed in the ISTp arm was not due to the artesunate component. Overall, the study suggests that ISTp is not a suitable alternative strategy to replace IPTp in areas with high levels of SP resistance. The findings are relevant to other high transmission areas in east and southern Africa where SP resistance is likely to become more widespread.
The paper compares the toxicity of two macrocyclic lactones, ivermectin (IVM) and moxidectin (MOX) in mice with P-gp deficiency. The study found that IVM has higher brain penetration and enters the brain more quickly than MOX, leading to lower lethal doses and fewer neurotoxic effects in mice with P-gp deficiency. MOX accumulates to a higher concentration in the brain than IVM at lower doses. In vitro, MOX was found to act as an allosteric modulator of the mammalian GABA receptor, potentiating its activation more efficiently than IVM. The differences in brain uptake and GABA receptor interactions between the two drugs may contribute to the differences in toxicity observed in vivo and in mice with P-gp deficiency. The study suggests that MOX has a wider margin of safety compared to IVM, which could be useful in considering its use in humans.
The paper discusses the results of a pharmacokinetic sub-study of the JIKI trial, which was conducted during the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa. The sub-study aimed to assess the concentrations of favipiravir, an RNA polymerase inhibitor, in patients with Ebola virus disease. The drug was given according to a dosing regimen of 120mg every 12 hours, with a loading dose of 600mg on the first day. However, the drug concentrations measured in the patients were significantly lower than the predicted concentrations based on a model developed by the manufacturer. The study found that the median favipira trough concentration at day 2 was close to the targeted trough concentration, but decreased by nearly 50% between days 2 and 4. The concentrations at day 4 were significantly lower, and were below the predicted concentrations based on individual patient characteristics. The study suggests that the lower drug concentrations may be due to the disease symptoms, the non-linear pharmacokinetics of favipiravir, and the non-linearity of the model used to predict drug exposure. The authors advocate for a dose-ranging study in healthy volunteers to assess the pharmacokinetics and tolerance of higher dosing regimens.
The paper describes an analysis of laboratory-confirmed Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infections among US Veterans Affairs patients in the US and Puerto Rico during the 2014 US epidemic. The majority of patients were diagnosed in Puerto Rico, where they were older and had more comorbidities. The authors found that among patients diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed CHIKV infection, age was associated with a higher risk of hospitalization, but only certain comorbidities (e.g. congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, chronic lung disease) remained associated with increased risk after adjusting for age. The lack of adequate testing, particularly for patients who presented late or had atypical symptoms, likely contributed to underdiagnosis of CHIKV infection. The study highlights the need for improved laboratory capacity for timely testing, particularly for patients with severe illness or comorbidities, to better manage clinical management and monitor those at greatest risk for severe complications.
This paper presents the results of a genome-wide interaction analysis to identify genetic variants that modify the effect of alcohol consumption on colorectal cancer risk. The authors analyzed genotype and environmental exposure data from 14 studies and found that a single variant at 9q232/HIATL1 interacts with light-to-moderate alcohol consumption in relation to colorectal cancer risk. This interaction was identified using both conventional logistic regression and the Cocktail method, which is a two-step approach that prioritizes genetic variants based on their association with disease risk and correlation with environmental factors. The variant at 9q232/HIATL1 is located in an intergenic region between HIATL1 and FBP2 and shows evidence of cis-acting quantitative trait loci (eQTL) for HIATL1 expression. The expression of HIATL1 was found to be higher in colorectal tumors compared to normal tissue, suggesting that the variant may impact HIATL1 expression. The interaction between 9q232/HIATL1 and light-to-moderate alcohol consumption was found to be significant in both men and women and across different cancer sites. The authors suggest that the identified variant may impact the expression of HIATL1, which is a member of the solute carrier protein family and plays a role in nutrient signaling and cellular function. Further studies are needed to confirm the interaction and understand its biological implications. Overall, the study provides evidence for a novel interaction between genetic variation and alcohol intake in colorectal cancer etiology.
The paper investigates the potential of using chemical compounds to block dengue virus (DENV) transmission by targeting mosquito proteins that are involved in the virus's replication and transmission. The researchers identify vATPase subunits and IMPDH as key proteins that are essential for DENV infection and transmission in adult Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. They test several known anti-dengue compounds, including bafilomycin (BAF), mycophenolic acid (MPA), castanospermine (CAS) and deoxynojirycin (DNJ), and find that they can reduce DENV infection in mosquito midguts and salivary glands when administered prior to or simultaneously with DENV infection. While BAF inhibits virus entry and MPA inhibits viral replication, the combination of the two compounds does not produce a synergistic effect. However, silencing the vATPase and IMPDH genes in mosquitoes using RNA interference results in significant reduction in DENV infection and mosquito fitness. The study suggests that vATPase and IMPDH are promising targets for developing transmission-blocking drugs that could be used to reduce DENV transmission without the ecological impact of insecticides.
The paper discusses the potential of combining immune checkpoint inhibitors with tumor vaccination in neuroblastoma immunotherapy. The authors show that in mouse models, vaccination with tumor cells that have been genetically modified to lack the immune checkpoint protein CTLA4 leads to the expansion and activation of tumor-infiltrating T cells, which in turn leads to the eradication of established tumors. However, the tumor cells themselves also upregulate the immune checkpoint protein PD1, which can evade immune response. Combining CTLA4 inhibition with PD1 blockade leads to enhanced tumor cell killing by activated T cells. The authors propose that this combination of therapies could be effective in immunogenic neuroblastoma, where tumor-infiltrating T cells are present, but less effective in nonimmunogenic tumors where PD1 expression is low. The combination of CTLA4 inhibition and PD1 blockade may have advantages over monotherapies, as it targets the tumor antigens and tumor-specific T cells, and the relatively short exposure to immune modulators may reduce side effects. The study shows that vaccine therapy can induce long-term immune memory and protect against tumor recurrence, although more research is needed to confirm the findings in human neuroblastoma.
The paper describes the generation and characterization of mice with targeted deletions of the miRNA genes miR-34a, miR-3b and miR-3c, which are key components of the p53 protein's response pathway. The authors show that complete loss of miR-34 expression does not significantly impair the p53-dependent cell cycle arrest, apoptosis or senescence responses in vitro or in vivo. This suggests that miR-34 is not a critical downstream effector of p53 and its loss may be redundant with other effectors. The paper argues that miR-34 likely plays a p53-independent role in basal cellular processes such as testis development and neuronal function. The results also suggest that miR-34 loss may cooperate with specific oncogenic lesions to promote tumorigenesis in some contexts. The generated mice will be useful for further investigating the potential tumor suppressive role of miR-34 and its interactions with other p53 effectors.
The paper investigates the role of the protein ZC3H30 in the African trypanosome Trypanosoma brucei, which is a parasite that causes African sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in tsetse flies. ZC3H30 is found in both bloodstream and procyclic forms of the parasite and is involved in RNA binding and translation regulation. The study shows that ZC3H30 is not essential for proliferation and growth of the parasite under normal conditions, but loss of ZC3H30 makes the parasite more susceptible to heat shock, oxidative stress, starvation and other stresses. ZC3H30 is found in stress granules in both bloodstream and procyclic forms, suggesting that it may be involved in sequestering mRNAs in these structures in response to stress. However, the study also shows that ZC3H30 does not bind to most ribosomal protein mRNAs and is not specific to the mRNAs it binds to. The study concludes that ZC3H30 may be involved in sequestering mRNAs in stress granules in response to stress, rather than moving to them. The findings suggest that ZC3H30 may play a role in stress resistance to stress and infection in both mammalian and tsetse trypanosomes.
The paper discusses how the genetic basis of reproductive differences between two strains of the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans (N2 and LSJ2) has been identified. The two strains were cultured in different environments (solid and liquid media) with different nutrient levels, leading to differences in reproductive rates and life history traits such as egg-laying rate, dauer formation, lifespan and growth rate. The study found that a 60 base pair deletion in the nurf-1 gene, which encodes an ortholog of human BPTF, is a pleiotropic regulator of these life history traits. This deletion was found to be advantageous in the liquid environment where the LSJ2 strain originated from, but disadvantageous in the solid environment where the N2 strain was cultured. The study suggests that the nurf-1 gene acts as a genetic "pleiotrope" that regulates multiple life history traits, with different isoforms of the gene controlling different traits. The findings provide a genetic handle to understand how life history traits are regulated and how species-level differences in these traits emerge. The study also highlights the importance of considering life history trade-offs when studying evolutionary changes.
This paper analyzed the genetic differences between dengue fever virus (DENV) strains isolated from Brazil between 190 and 2010, focusing on the Southeast Asian genotype II. They found that strains isolated after 2007 belonged to this genotype, while those isolated between 190 and 2003 belonged to the Southeast Asian genotype I. The analysis of the coding regions of the virus showed that strains from 2007-2010 were more similar to strains from the Dominican Republic, suggesting that a new lineage of DENV-2 emerged in Brazil, likely introduced from the Caribbean. The study suggests that the re-emergence of DENV-2 in Brazil in 2007-2008 led to the most severe epidemic in the country, with 7872 cases and 49 deaths. The Caribbean has been identified as an important region for the circulation and exportation of DENV-2 strains, which may contribute to changes in disease morbidity and severity in dengue endemic countries. The findings emphasize the need for increased virological surveillance to monitor the emergence or re-emergence of DENV strains with pathogenic potential to cause epidemics.
The paper discusses the discovery that some strains of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) and enterohemorrhagic EHEC (EHEC) can invade non-phagocytic cells by inducing membrane ruffles on the host cell surface, which facilitates their entry into the host cells. The authors found that expression of the T3SS effector protein EspT in EPEC strains leads to formation of membrane ruffles and invasive capacity. This invasion mechanism is dependent on the activation of Rac1 and Cdc2 GTPases and the WxxxE effectors, which interact with the host actin cytoskeleton. They showed that EPEC bound within a vacuole are associated with intracellular pedestals reminiscent of extracellular pedestals, which are required for bacterial survival. The intracellular pedestals are also associated with the T3SS effector Tir and are localized at the vacuolar membrane in a T3SS dependent manner. The study demonstrates for the first time that an intracellular bacterium can recruit filamentous actin comets to the pathogen cell surface while encapsulated in a vacuole, which may constitute a physical barrier to lysosome fusion protecting the bacteria from lysosomal degradation. The findings suggest that formation of intracellular pedestals by invasive EPEC may play a role in maintaining the vacuole integrity and survival within host cells. The study provides evidence that invasive EPEC is a new category of pathogen, distinct from previously considered extracellular pathogens.
The paper describes a method for identifying synergistic drug combinations that can overcome antibiotic resistance. The method, called O2M, uses a known synergistic drug interaction between two molecules as a "seed" to predict additional synergistic interactions between other molecules. They applied this approach to identify new synergistic combinations for the antibiotic trimethoprim. They analyzed a chemical genomics dataset and identified 5 new synergistic combinations with trimethoprim. They then tested these combinations in a zebrafish model of infection and found that the combination of trimethoprim and AZT, a DNA-damaging drug, was effective against trimethoprim-resistant bacteria, while the combination of trimethoprim and floxuridine, a floxuridine analog, was effective against floxuridine-resistant bacteria. The results suggest that synergistic drug combinations can bypass antibiotic resistance by inducing multiple mechanisms of action, and the method has the potential to identify new treatments that could be deployed in the clinic more quickly than new drugs.
The paper discusses how the loss of Filamin B (FlnB) leads to spinal fusions in mice. FLNB is expressed throughout the developing skeleton, but the upregulation of TGFβ and BMP signaling in the axial skeleton has a profound effect on the cartilage tissues. In the absence of FLNB, TGFβ signaling is increased in the vertebral growth plate, leading to an accelerated differentiation of chondrocytes, which undergo an inappropriate transition to a chondrocytic fate. This results in the disruption of the nucleus pulposus and subsequent fusion of the flanking vertebral bodies. The authors propose that FLNB regulates TGFβ/BMP signaling in these tissues to maintain proper molecular balance and prevent degeneration during postnatal development. They show that the increase in TGFβ/BMP signaling in the vertebral growth plate leads to the transformation of fibroblast-like AF cells into chondrocytes, resulting in disruption of the nucleus pulposus and fusion of the flanking vertebral bodies, similar to the degeneration seen in aging discs. The findings provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying spinal fusions and may direct the development of therapeutic solutions.
The paper discusses the discovery of a new giant virus gene that encodes a translation factor that involves both a readthrough stop codon and a frameshift. The gene, R726, was initially annotated as a class-I peptide release factor, but the authors found that it actually contains both a readthrough stop and a frameshift stop, allowing the protein to bypass these internal stop codons and produce a full-length protein. The authors used experimental and computational methods to demonstrate that the R726 gene in Mimivirus and Megavirus viruses is able to produce a full-length protein, although it remains to be verified whether this protein is a genuine peptide chain release factor. The gene structure is found to be similar to eukaryotic and archaeal class-I release factors, but it contains an autoregulatory mechanism that is not found in bacterial class-I release factors. The authors suggest that the R726 gene may have evolved from an ancestral genome that encoded a complete translation system, and that the frameshift and readthrough mechanism is a remnant from this ancestor. The discovery of this unusual gene structure highlights the complex translation regulation in giant viruses and the possibility that giant viruses may have an ancient origin predating the radiation of eukaryotes.
The paper investigates how the ability to generate random sequences of symbols, a key aspect of probabilistic reasoning, changes across the lifespan. It collects data from participants aged 4-91 through online RIG tasks that require participants to generate random sequences using playful instructions. The tasks include binary responses, guessing a card, tossing a coin, filling a grid, rolling a die, and pointing to circles. The tasks tap different cognitive abilities like attention, inhibition and working memory. The paper finds that across the lifespan, mean complexity and completion time show a similar pattern, with a peak in the 25-35 age range, followed by a slow decline. The ability to generate random sequences is found to be correlated across tasks, indicating that different tasks tap into different cognitive components. The ability to generate random sequences is found to be influenced by factors like sex, education level and paranormal beliefs. The paper also introduces a new measure of algorithmic complexity that can be used to evaluate random generation tasks with short sequences, which is found to be able to capture the ability to generate random sequences beyond what existing complexity measures can. The findings support the idea that RIG tasks are good measures of complex cognitive abilities and provide complementary information about a person's cognitive abilities. The results shed light on how the developmental change in the ability to generate random sequences is built and how it relates to cognitive processes like attention, inhibition and working memory.
This paper proposes a new model for understanding how the human uterus functions during labor. The model uses both electrical activity and mechanotransduction, where pressure changes cause neighboring regions to contract. The authors argue that the traditional view of a single stable pacemaker region initiating contractions is not necessary, but instead, different regions contract in a sequence based on their sensitivity and pressure changes. The model simulates coordinated contractions by using a cellular automaton, where each cell represents a region of the uterus. The model shows that the number of regions, sensitivity, and pressure changes affect how coordinated contractions occur. The authors propose that a stable pacemaker region may not be necessary and that the first region to initiate contractions may not always participate in each one. The model suggests that coordinated contractions arise from a complex interplay of electrical and mechanical properties, rather than a single pacemaker. The study highlights how different conditions, such as multiple gestations, lesions, and gestational age, may affect the distances action potentials can propagate and the number of functional regions. Further work is needed to determine the validity of the model and how to use it to predict and treat abnormal labor patterns.
This paper argues that the membrane organization of the planctomycete Gemmata obscurigus is not fundamentally different from that of classical Gram-negative bacteria, but rather a complex variant of it. The authors used 3D electron microscopy to reconstruct the internal membrane system of multiple cells of G. obscurigus and found that the membranes are not compartmentalized or nucleated, but instead interconnected. The cell has an outer membrane (OM) and an inner membrane (IM), with the IM invaginated to form a network of sheets within the cytoplasm. The cytoplasm and periplasm are connected, and the genetic material is free to move between them without any membrane compartments. The results challenge the previous claims that G. obscurigus has a unique membrane organization and lacking a nucleus-like structure. Instead, the findings suggest that the internal membranes are an extension of the periplasm, and the genetic material is free to move between the two cell volumes. The results have implications for understanding the evolutionary relationship between prokaryotes and eukaryotes, as the complex endomembrane system of G. obscurigus is similar to that of eukaryotes in some ways and may represent an intermediate step in the development of the eukaryotic endomembrane system from a classical Gram-negative bacterium.
The paper discusses the expansion of two distinct subsets of CD4+ T cells expressing either IL-5 or IL-10, known as IL-5+Th2 and IL-5-Th2 cells, in response to infection with the filarial parasite Wuchostia malayi. The authors find that these subsets are expanded in individuals with subclinical or asymptomatic infection but not in those with clinical filarial lymphedema. The IL-5+Th2 cells are associated with increased production of eosinophils and neutrophils and IgE and IgG4 antibodies, while the IL-5-Th2 cells are associated with increased IgE and IgG4 responses. The expansion of these subsets is found to be dependent on the continued presence of circulating parasite antigen, suggesting a role in the protection against clinical pathology. The study suggests that these subsets may play different roles in immune regulation and may be important for filarial infection and disease pathogenesis. However, the study has some limitations due to the use of both retrospectively and prospectively collected samples and the lack of rigorous controls, and so the conclusions cannot be generalized. Further research is needed to elucidate the development and function of these subsets in filarial infection.
The paper discusses how the virus Picornavirus, which belongs to the Picornaviridae family, can infect human respiratory epithelial cells in the lower airway and cause respiratory diseases such as asthma exacerbations and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The authors investigate how Picornavirus recognition and signaling to interferons and cytokines is mediated by both endosomal Toll-like receptors TLR3 and RNA helicases RIG-I and MDA5. They find that TLR3 and RIG-I are required for maximal interferon beta and pro-inflammatory cytokine production in human bronchial epithelial cells, while MDA5 is required for interferon lambda production. The authors propose a model where TLR3 senses viral DNA in the endosome and induces RIG-I and MDA5, which are then required for anti-viral defense. RIG-I and MDA5 are induced early in response to virus infection and remain elevated throughout the infection. TLR3 is constitutively expressed in bronchial epithelial cells, but RIG-I is not. The authors show that TLR3, RIG-I and MDA5 are all required for maximal interferon beta and cytokine production, but RIG-I is more important for interferon beta. They also show that TLR3 is required for RIG-I and MDA5 gene expression. The results suggest that the endosomal and cytoplasmic recognition pathways work in concert and that RNA helicases are important for continual monitoring the intracellular viral load and inducing immune responses. The findings provide insight into how Picornavirus infection is recognized and the innate immune response it triggers in human respiratory epithelial cells.
The paper proposes a model to explain the segregation of microtubules and neurofilaments in axons that occurs in neurodegenerative diseases. The model describes microtubules, neurofilaments, and organelles as particles that move in a 2D cross-section of an axon, with microtubules aligning along the length, and neurofilaments moving along the axon via molecular motors. When neurofilament transport is selectively blocked, organelles move towards the microtubules and push them together, causing the microtubules to cluster. This microtube clustering leads to neurofilament segregation. The model shows that the rate of segregation depends on the frequency of organelle movement and the size of the organelles, with larger organelles being more effective. Restoration of neurofilament transport allows the microtubules and neurofilaments to mix again. The paper predicts that the segregation is dependent on organelle movement and that larger organelles cause faster segregation. The model also shows that microtubule clustering occurs initially and smaller clusters merge to form larger ones. The paper suggests that the segregation is an early event in impaired neurofilament transport, leading to longitudinal instabilities that give rise to local neurofilament accumulations. The model provides insights into the factors influencing segregation and can be used to test the predictions experimentally. The paper demonstrates that the segregation observed in experiments is consistent with the model.
The paper presents a theoretical model of how eukaryotic cells polarize in response to external stimuli, specifically through the Rho-GTPase signaling pathway. The authors developed a sequence of models starting from the simplest Rac-based polarization mechanism, which can reproduce wave-pinning behavior, and incorporate additional GTPases such as Cdc42 and Rho. They show that cell geometry and feedback from phosphoinositides play important roles in the polarization process. They find that cell length and surface area to volume ratio can influence the response threshold and stabilize polarization. The final model, consisting of three GTPases with mutual inhibition, can account for many aspects of symmetry breaking and polarization observed in HeLa cells. The paper demonstrates how a novel local perturbation analysis technique can be used to analyze the behavior of the models and gain insights into the system. The findings provide a framework for understanding the role of different GTPases and feedbacks in cell polarization and motility, and how geometry can stabilize polarization.
The paper describes the population structure and demographic history of the triatomine bug Rhodnius nasutus in the Caatinga biome of Brazil. The study used mitochondrial cytochrome b (cyt b) and microsatellite markers to analyze 147 cyt b sequences and 157 microsatellite loci from 53 Copernicia prunifera palm trees in 8 localities across the biome. The cyt b data revealed 4 genetic groups, while the microsatellite data identified 7 genetic clusters. The cyt b data indicated complex substructure between localities, with some groups showing high gene flow while others showed reduced diversity and isolation. The microsatellite data showed 4 highly differentiated clusters with high pairwise FST values, indicating population expansion occurred in the past. The demographic history inferred from both markers suggested a western-eastern colonization of the biome, with R. nasutus populations expanding from west to east during the last 12-10 thousand years. This expansion coincided with global climate changes and the expansion of seasonally dry forests in the region. However, the microsatellite data showed a different pattern of genetic structure, with 4 clusters identified, indicating that some groups were isolated from others. The results suggest that human activities, such as deforestation and habitat fragmentation, may have reduced connectivity and led to restricted gene flow among R. nasutus populations in the Caatinga region, leading to the observed genetic structure. This study highlights the importance of considering the distribution and dynamics of R. nasutus in Chagas disease control efforts, as insecticide spraying may only reduce transmission in the short-term and does not address the continuous re-infestation of insecticide-treated households by abundant native vectors.
The paper presents a discrete lattice gas model for studying the formation of precartilage condensations in developing limb mesenchymal cells. The model extends the earlier model of Kiskowski et al. by incorporating more realistic cell and molecular dynamics, such as cell shape changes and molecular diffusion. The cells are represented as multipixel objects that can move and change shape in a virtual third dimension, and are separated by less than a cell diameter. The model includes parameters that are calibrated to experimental values for cell diffusion and molecular diffusion rates, activator and inhibitor production rates, and cell differentiation thresholds. The model reproduces the spatial and temporal patterns of precartilage condensations observed in micromass cultures, including the size and distribution of fibronectin patches, the onset of fibronectin production and the shape changes of cells. The authors show that two regimes of reaction-diffusion dynamics, with either stationary or oscillatory production of activator morphogens, can lead to stable or transient patterns of precartilage condensations, respectively. The model demonstrates that cell-cell adhesion is not required for precartilage condensation, but can affect the spatial distribution of fibronectin patches. The simulations provide a framework for testing and comparing alternative models of precartilage condensation and could be extended to study other periodic patterning processes.
The paper describes a new approach to measuring changes in mRNA stability in response to environmental cues. The authors used 4-thiouracil labeling and RNA sequencing to measure the abundance of specific mRNAs in yeast cells before and after a nitrogen upshift, which involves adding glutamine to nitrogen-limited cells. They identified factors that mediate accelerated mRNA degradation, including the Lsm1-7p/Pat1p complex, decapping modifiers, and core degradation factors. The Lsm1-7p/Pat1p complex and decapping modifiers were found to affect both GAP1 mRNA expression and degradation, indicating that they play a key role in regulating GAP1 mRNA stability. The study shows that accelerated mRNA degradation is not limited to NCR transcripts but also targets transcripts involved in carbon metabolism, particularly pyruvate metabolism. The results suggest that mRNA stability allows cells to rapidly reprogram gene expression in response to environmental cues by clearing transcripts that are no longer required. The approach used could be applied to study the genetic basis of mRNA dynamics in a variety of contexts, including nutrient limitation and stress responses.
This paper provides a systematic review of the epidemiology of Japanese encephalitis in the Philippines, which is an endemic disease in the country. The authors found that Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) has been identified as a cause of encephalitis in the Philippines and is distributed across the country, affecting children under 15 years of age and adults. Serological surveys suggest that most residents are infected by 15 years of age and immune to JEV, resulting in a lower number of cases found in adults. However, JE still poses a significant threat to public health, with case fatality rates ranging from 6-7%. The authors identified 29 articles and presentations on JE in the Philippines, which reported on serologic surveys, clinical cases, animal surveys and surveillance data. Laboratory confirmation was not available for some outbreaks. The review found that JEV was identified in all regions of the country and was an important cause of encephalitis in clinical disease. The review suggests that a one-time campaign vaccinating children under 15 years of age followed by incorporation of JE vaccine in the routine program for young children would be a suitable strategy to control the disease. Improved sentinel surveillance is needed to systematically quantify the burden of disease over time. The Philippine government has plans to expand sentinel surveillance with laboratory confirmation to provide a baseline for measuring vaccine impact.
This paper describes the identification of a novel mechanism by which the herpesvirus 8 virus (HHV-8) regulates its replication through the inhibition of Bcl-2 family protein Bim. The authors found that the HHV-8 encoded viral interferon regulatory factor vIRF-1 can mediate the inhibition of Bim through nuclear sequestration, specifically the binding of Bim to a nuclear localization signal. Bim is normally localized in the cytoplasm where it functions as an inhibitor of virus replication, but when sequestered by vIRF-1 to the nucleus, it is inactivated and unable to inhibit apoptosis. The study demonstrates that vIRF-1:Bim interaction is important for HHV-8 productive replication, and that disrupting this interaction through peptide-mediated disruption can potentially provide an antiviral strategy. The results suggest that targeting vIRF-1:Bim interaction may provide a useful means to inhibit HHV-8 replication.
The paper discusses the immune response to the poxvirus MVA in human macrophages. The authors find that MVA induces a strong innate immune response in macrophages, characterized by a robust production of chemokines and cytokines such as IL-8 and IFNβ. They identify the TLR2-TLR6-MyD8, MDA-5-IPS1 and NALP3 inflammasome pathways as the main sensors of MVA in macrophages and find that these pathways are responsible for the production of these cytokines. The TLR2-TLR6-MyD8 pathway is required for the induction of IFNβ and IL-1β production, while the NALP3 inflammasome is involved in the processing of pro-IL-1β into mature IL-1β. The RLR pathway also plays a role in the production of IL-8 and chemokines. The study highlights the differences in the immune response between attenuated and non-attenuated poxviruses, with attenuated poxviruses like MVA inducing more robust cytokine production. The findings provide insights into the pathogenesis of poxvirus infections and may help design new vaccine vectors with improved immunogenicity.
The paper discusses how the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway regulates cell proliferation and tissue patterning in metazoans, and how its deregulation is associated with numerous human diseases. In the Drosophila intestine, Wnt signaling is essential for self-renewal of stem cells and proliferation of intestinal stem cells. However, previous studies have suggested that Wnt signaling in midgut stem cells activates the pathway in midgut stem cells, leading to their self-renewal and proliferation. The authors found that Wnt signaling is actually activated at compartment boundaries in the adult intestine, specifically at the boundaries between different functional compartments. They identified several novel sources of Wnt expression in the epithelium and muscle surrounding the midgut, and found that Wnt signaling in enterocytes non-autonomously regulates JAK-STAT signaling in neighboring intestinal stem cells, preventing their non-autonomous overproliferation. This is essential for maintaining homeostasis in the adult intestine. Disruption of Wnt signaling in enterocytes leads to the aberrant overproliferation of nearby intestinal stem cells, which likely results from a failure of proper cell fate specification. The authors propose that Wnt signaling at compartment boundaries serves as a "brake" that must be released or bypassed during regeneration following injury. The findings suggest that Wnt signaling may have conserved roles in maintaining tissue organization and cell fate specification in the adult intestine.
This paper discusses the development of muscle fibers in the zebrafish embryo. The authors used time-lapse microscopy and cellular morphometry to analyze the development of fast-twitch muscle fibers. They identified three phases of muscle morphogenesis: short muscle precursor cells, elongating cells, and myotubes. The elongating cells exhibit different behaviors and morphological changes that distinguish them from one another. They found that lamin proteins are required for proper muscle cell elongation and organization, and that the failure of lamin proteins leads to disorganized myotubes. The authors propose that muscle cells elongate by extending protrusions that adhere to other cells or the extracellular matrix, and that lamin proteins may play a role in stopping muscle fibers at the myotome boundary. They also show that muscle fibers can elongate independently of lamin proteins, but that lamin proteins are necessary for efficient muscle cell elongation. The results suggest that muscle morphogenesis is complex and involves interactions between muscle fibers and the basement membrane during elongation and attachment to the myotome. The study provides new insights into the cellular mechanisms underlying muscle development and lays a framework for understanding molecular mechanisms that underlie muscle morphogenesis in vertebrates.
The paper investigates the host-feeding behavior and transmission risks of Triatoma infestans, a vector of Chagas disease, in rural Argentine households during spring and summer. The authors developed a new method to estimate the daily human-feeding rate of domestic Triatomine bugs, which was found to be high, with a median of 7.2 human-bug feeding contacts per person per day. They found that the number of human-bug feeding contacts per person decreased with the presence of chickens and dogs in the household, which is consistent with zoopotentiation rather than zooprophylaxis. The authors suggest that domestic animals in human sleeping quarters can reduce transmission risks by acting as lethal traps, but more research is needed to confirm this hypothesis. The study highlights the importance of appropriate animal husbandry practices and insecticide spraying to control Triatomine infestations and transmission of Chagas disease in rural areas.
The paper discusses how the inhibition of apoptosis by viral genes, particularly the gene M36, enables the virus to grow in immunodeficient hosts. The authors show that M36-deficient viruses are attenuated in macrophages and immunodeficient mice, indicating that macrophages play a key role in controlling the growth of these viruses. They propose a model where activated macrophages secrete TNF-alpha which synergizes with IFNgamma to block apoptosis in fibroblasts, allowing the virus to grow. This model suggests that the inhibition of apoptosis by M36 may be a key mechanism for the virus to evade immune response and grow in immunodeficient hosts. The authors propose that M36 could be a good target for antiviral therapies, potentially protecting immunodeficient patients from cytomegalovirus infection.
This paper proposes a new method called Nonparametric Bayes Ensemble Learning (NBE) to predict protein-protein interactions from multiple genomic data sources. The existing methods like Naive Bayes and logistic regression equally weight all data sources without considering their informativeness. The NBE method learns the distributions of interacting and non-interacting protein pairs within each data source, and adaptively weights the less informative sources to reduce false positives and false negatives. The authors show through simulations that NBE is significantly more robust to contaminated data and predicts more protein-protein interactions than the existing methods, especially when the number of data sources increases. They test their method on human data and show that it predicts more interactions than the other methods, indicating that both false positives and false negatives exist in current predictions. The authors argue that predicting both types of errors is important for reliable protein-protein interaction predictions. The ability to predict large numbers of interactions reliably and automatically could help improve other related studies.
The paper describes a comprehensive algorithm for identifying bidirectional promoters in the human genome using spliced expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and mRNA data. Bidirectional promoters are defined as genes arranged head-to-head on opposite strands within 100 base pairs of one another. The authors found 565 bidirectional promoters in the human genome using their algorithm, nearly four times more than previously identified. They show that a subset of these promoters, which regulate genes implicated in breast and ovarian cancers, contain transcription factor binding sites in common. These genes are associated with DNA repair genes and show enrichment of bidirectional promoters. The authors propose that misregulation of bidirectional promoters may play a role in cancer through epigenetic modifications such as methylation of the promoters. They identify 16 genes associated with sporadic breast and ovarian cancers that are regulated through this mechanism. The bidirectional promoters are associated with coordinated expression patterns and show enrichment of transcription factor binding sites, particularly the ETS family. The authors suggest that misregulation of bidirectional promoters may be a common mechanism underlying sporadic cancers.
The paper proposes a model-based predictive control methodology to estimate a robust treatment course to restore the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis to a normal function in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) who exhibit chronic hypocortisolism. The authors use a numerical model of the HPA axis proposed by Gupta et al. to estimate a treatment that would bring the patient's cortisol levels back to normal by suppressing cortisol for a short period until ACTH levels exceed 30% of baseline. This treatment involves reducing cortisol levels until ACTH levels increase by 30% relative to the initial condition, and then discontinuing the treatment. The proposed treatment strategy is robust over a wide range of parameter values, initial conditions and ambient stress levels. The methodology could potentially be used in a two-step approach where a simple model is first used to calibrate the overall HPA dynamics for a given patient, and then the calibrated model is used within the MPC framework to estimate the optimal treatment parameters. The authors propose that reducing cortisol levels could be achieved by binding proteins or metabolizing enzymes that inhibit negative feedback on the HPA axis without affecting ACTH synthesis. While the specific treatment identified in the model is model-dependent, the general MPC framework provides a useful approach to estimate treatment parameters that can be robustly obtained over a wide range of model parameters.
The paper discusses the results of a study on the effectiveness of a single round of mass antibiotic treatment on eliminating trachoma infection in children under the age of 9 in communities with high prevalence of the disease. The study found that while mass treatment of azithromycin significantly decreased infection in children under 9, it did not eliminate the pool of infection. In fact, the highest prevalence of infection was found in children aged 2-4 years old, who were not treated at baseline and had an increased risk of infection post-mass treatment. The authors suggest that one round of treatment may not be enough to eliminate the infection in these communities, and recommend continuing mass treatment at least every 6 months to achieve this goal. They note that their findings support previous studies that have shown that more frequent treatment is needed. However, they acknowledge that the study had limitations such as not being able to measure chlamydial load and losing some subjects during follow-up, which may have biased the results.
The paper investigated whether repeated endurance training induces a skeletal muscle transcriptome memory. The authors performed a one-legged training regime where one leg was trained while the other leg served as an untrained control. They collected skeletal muscle biopsies before and after each training period to study the global transcriptome response. They found that repeated endurance training induced consistent changes in genes and splicing events at the transcriptome level, although there were some differences in the specific genes affected between the two legs. However, there was a clear correlation between the genes that changed in the first training period and those that changed in both legs trained in the second period. The authors found over 300000 splicing events changed with endurance training, indicating that endurance training altered the skeletal muscle transcriptome. However, they were unable to identify a consistent skeletal muscle transcriptome memory that persisted after detraining. The results suggest that while some genes may show consistent changes across training periods, there is also significant within-subject variability in the training response. The study highlights the need for controlled studies to evaluate intra-individual variability in training response and potential skeletal muscle memory.
This paper investigates how the plant photoreceptors cryptochrome 1 and cryptochrome 2 interact with the ubiquitin ligase complex CO1/SPA. It is found that cryptochrome 1 requires the presence of SPA proteins to interact with CO1, while cryptochrome 2 can interact with CO1 in the absence of SPA proteins. This suggests that CO1 primarily recognizes the phosphorylated, active form of cryptochromes. The interaction between cryptochrome 1 and CO1 is dependent on SPA proteins, while the interaction between cryptochrome 2 and CO1 is not. This is consistent with the idea that phosphorylation of cryptochromes exposes an interaction domain that CO1 can bind. The paper proposes that SPA proteins may act as a bridging protein to allow the CO1-cryptochrome interaction. The study uses co-immunoprecipitation experiments in plants, yeast two-hybrid assays and yeast three-hybrid assays to investigate the interactions between cryptochromes and CO1. The results suggest that CO1 interacts with the phosphorylated form of cryptochromes and that SPA proteins are required for this interaction in vivo. However, the exact mechanisms by which CO1 and cryptochromes interact in the absence of SPA proteins are still unclear. The study highlights the importance of SPA proteins in the light-dependent regulation of plant development.
The paper proposes a new approach to identify domain-domain binding sites in proteins by decomposing domains into modules based on their residue interactions. The modules are characterized by strong within-module interactions and weak between-module interactions. The authors find that non-overlapping binding sites in a domain are usually located in different modules, indicating that domains can be decomposed into functional modules. They show that modules with high cooperativity (modularity) tend to contain binding site residues, suggesting that binding sites are groups of cooperative residues within modules. The authors find that combining modularity with other features like conservation or surface patches improves the prediction of binding site regions. The approach complements other methods and provides a deeper understanding of how the modular architecture of protein domains contributes to their function. The paper concludes that the modular organization of binding sites provides robustness and flexibility to protein function, allowing protein function to adapt to different partners.
The paper presents a mathematical model of the Drosophila circadian clock, which is a robust, free-running, temperature-compensated biological clock found in diverse organisms. The model incorporates interlocked feedback loops and post-translational modifications to the PER and CLK proteins. The model shows that independent transfer of PER and TIM by mass action kinetics is inconsistent with experimental observations, but an additional feedback loop or intermediate phosphorylation is able to produce the switch-like dissociation of cytoplasmic PER-TIM underlying the interval timer. The positive feedback was introduced into a mechanistic framework for Drosophila circadian rhythms which demonstrates excellent agreement with experimentally observed expression profiles of circadian genes and many circadian mutants. The framework is consistent with observations of the relationship between dosage and circadian periodicity. The models also show that independent transfer of PER and TIM by mass action kinetics is inconsistent with experimental observations, but an additional feedback loop or intermediate phosphorylation is able to produce the switch-like dissociation of cytoplasmic PER-TIM underlying the interval. The paper finds that the nuclear localization of PER and TIM can occur independently while producing stable oscillations when positive feedback is employed. The model accurately captures a majority of the published experimental observations but some mutants display behavior that is not fully consistent with the model.
The paper reports the discovery of seven antiparasitic compounds from the creosote bush plant Larrea tridentata that can inhibit the growth of pathogenic protozoans Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia lamblia, and Naegleria fowleri. The compounds were isolated from the plant using bioassays and spectroscopy techniques and their structures were elucidated through NMR and HRMS analysis. The most potent compounds, 1 and 2, were found to be 1.5-2.5 fold more effective against N. fowleri compared to the current drug miltefosine, which is used to treat invasive amebiasis. The authors suggest that the compounds may inhibit cysteine protease activity present in the trophozoites, which is important for N. fowleri's pathogenesis. The study identifies lignan and flavon secondary metabolites as a promising class of natural products for the treatment of protozoan infections, with potential for optimization through medicinal chemistry.
The paper describes a randomized controlled trial evaluating the effectiveness of a multidisciplinary intervention aimed at improving dizziness symptoms in community-living adults aged 50 and over who self-reported experiencing dizziness. The intervention included vestibular rehabilitation, cognitive behavioral therapy, exercise, and medical management based on assessment results. While the intervention showed some positive effects on dizziness handicap, composite fall risk, and balance, the results were not statistically significant for frequency of dizziness episodes, step time variability and gait speed. The study found that 12% of the community aged 50 and over reported experiencing dizziness, and a comprehensive assessment and tailored interventions may offer a more effective and efficient approach. However, the study had some limitations, including a single-center design, reliance on self-reported data, and the intervention consisted of one or more individualized components. The results suggest that a multidisciplinary approach to assessment and intervention, using evidence-based therapies, may be beneficial for improving dizziness symptoms in older adults.
The paper describes a study that investigated how information from the dorsal visual stream is transmitted to the ventral visual stream during 3D object vision. The authors used a combination of functional MRI (fMRI), reversible inactivation-fMRI, and electrical microstimulation-fMRI techniques to map the neural connections between different cortical areas in the dorsal and ventral visual streams. They found that area CIP in the caudal intraparietal sulcus, which is specialized for 3D orientation and disparity sensitivity, contributes causally to the activity in the anterior intraparietal sulcus and anterior inferior temporal cortex during 3D vision tasks. Specifically, inactivation of CIP resulted in significant decreases in activity in these areas, which affected performance on a 3D shape categorization task. The results suggest that CIP inactivation affects the ventral stream through indirect connections, likely through the lateral intraparietal sulcus and ventral areas, rather than direct connections. This study provides evidence that 3D object information in the dorsal stream affects the ventral stream during 3D vision tasks, which is consistent with the functional organization of the human visual cortex.
The paper investigates how the human motor system plans movements to maximize expected gain in the face of temporal uncertainty. The authors introduced temporal penalties for early or late arrivals during a movement task and measured the resulting temporal uncertainty. They found that subjects' movements were optimized to maximize expected gain under this temporal uncertainty, taking into account the experimentally imposed temporal noise. The optimal model incorporated both the temporal uncertainty function and the experimentally added noise, while suboptimal models failed to account for either or both. The optimal model had strong evidence favoring it over the suboptimal models, indicating that subjects effectively compensated for the increased temporal uncertainty and temporal noise. The results suggest that the motor system can estimate and compensate for its own temporal uncertainty in planning movements, providing evidence for the usefulness of temporal information in movement planning.
This paper describes the emergence and disappearance of different lineages of Vibrio cholerae O1 isolates causing cholera in an endemic area in Kolkata, India over a five-year period. The researchers analyzed genomic data from 41 of the isolates and found that the emergence of the Inaba serotype was associated with a clonal expansion of a specific lineage, while the disappearance of the Inaba isolates was abrupt and followed by the reversion of the wbeT gene back to its active form in another lineage. The low diversity between the Inaba isolates suggests that specific triggers likely precipitated the emergence of the Inaba isolates. The wbeT gene is highly conserved in Ogawa isolates, but under certain conditions inactivating mutations can be readily isolated, suggesting that the change to Inaba may contribute to the ability of V. cholera to persist in endemic areas. The study provides valuable insights into the dynamics of cholera in endemic areas and suggests that serotype switching is driven by undetermined mechanisms beyond simple serotype-specific immunity. The emergence and persistence of Inaba isolates may be due to factors beyond the serotype itself, such as environmental conditions and the presence of vibrio phages. The findings suggest that the wbeT gene may have an important role in the persistence of V. cholera, although the exact nature of these factors remains unclear. Further studies are needed to fully understand the factors contributing to the spread and persistence of cholera in endemic areas.
The paper discusses the role of coagulases (Coa and vWbp) in the pathogenesis of Staphylocococcus aureus infections. The authors found that both Coa and vWbp are required for the ability of S. aureus to clot mouse or human blood, and are important for the establishment of abscesses. Antibodies directed against Coa and vWbp can block the formation of Coa·prothrombin and vWbp·prothrombin complexes, which are necessary for staphylococcal pathogenesis. Passive transfer of Coa and vWbp antibodies provides protection against staphyloccal abscess formation and lethal bacteremia. The authors propose that clotting of fibrinogen by secreted coagulases is a critical event in the establishment of staphyloccal communities surrounded by eosinophilic pseudocapsules and subsequent abscess development. They surmise that coagulases, Coa and vWbp, may be important antigens in the development of a vaccine that can protect against the current CA-MRSA epidemic.
The paper describes a study investigating the epidemiology of typhoid fever in children in a rural setting in Cambodia. The study found that there is a significant burden of typhoid fever in children in rural Cambodia, which questions the assumption that typhoid fever is primarily found in urban areas with poor sanitation. The study used whole genome sequencing to identify subtypes of Salmonella Typhi circulating in the area and found that a dominant H58 subtype is associated with multidrug resistance. The study found that proximity to Tonle Sap Lake and access to water in the household were protective against typhoid fever, with communes located near the lake having the highest incidence. The study also identified spatiotemporal clusters of typhoid cases and found that the emergence of a specific subtype of H58 was associated with localized disease outbreaks. The study suggests that immunizing school-aged children before the wet season may provide the most effective approach for introducing conjugate vaccines to control typhoid fever in Cambodia. The findings provide new insights into the epidemiology of typhoid in a rural setting and suggest that access to water sources may play a role in the spread of the disease. However, the study has some limitations due to data being based on patients attending a single healthcare facility and the lack of individual-level exposure data.
This paper describes the development and testing of an inactivated human enterovirus 7 (EV7) vaccine candidate using mice and rabbits as animal models. The vaccine was prepared using an inactivation method that leaves no residual inactivant and completely eliminates viral infectivity within 24 hours while preserving antigenicity. The inactivated vaccine was purified using ion-exchange and size-exclusion chromatography and showed good immunogenicity, with neutralizing titers that were sustained for over 3 months. The vaccine was tested in mice at different doses and found to elicit a significant immune response with the addition of an adjuvant. The highest dose induced a complete seroconversion, while lower doses resulted in incomplete seroconversion. The vaccine was then tested in rabbits in a GLP toxicology study and no adverse effects were observed. The vaccine was shown to be effective in protecting against morbidity and mortality in a mouse model. The authors suggest that an inactivated EV7 vaccine has advantages over live attenuated vaccines, including that it cannot revert to a more pathogenic phenotype, can manipulate immune responses, and is cost-effective.
The paper describes a new assay to study the entry of HIV-1 into cells based on the direct translation of a viral genome mimic luciferase reporter into viral cores. The authors developed the entry/uncoating assay by producing viral particles that incorporate a minimal HIV genome reporter mRNA, the EU-repRNA, which lacks elements required for reverse transcription. The EU-repRNA is delivered to cells after viral-to-cell fusion, allowing them to measure the extent to which viral cores are open to translation. The assay reveals that there are two measurable species of viral cores: those that are directly accessible to translation (PF74-dependent) and those that require high doses of PF74 to be exposed. The authors show that reverse transcription does not lead to an increased exposure of the viral genome to the cell cytoplasm, but rather, viral cores remain in a closed or partially closed form. The assay provides insights into the early steps of HIV infection and how the viral genome is protected from the hostile cellular environment. The results suggest that viral cores undergo structural changes during reverse transcription, but still retain their ability to protect the genome from the cellular environment. The assay is compared to existing assays like the Blam-Vpr test and is found to be a useful alternative for large screens for identifying HIV entry inhibitors.
The paper discusses how the enzyme RNase L (ribonuclease L) plays a role in controlling virus infections in the central nervous system. The authors found that mice deficient in RNase L are more susceptible to infection with the virus gliotropic Meckel-Hepatitis virus-J cerebral virus (MHV-JHM) in the CNS, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. The RNase L deficiency was found to result in more focal areas of microglia infection in the brain stem and spinal cord grey matter, which correlated with increased demyelination and axonal damage. The authors suggest that RNase L mediates protection from viral infection in microglia and macrophages, but not neurons. Infection of microglia may result in increased proinflammatory responses and localized toxicity, leading to the observed pathology. However, the exact mechanisms by which RNase L provides this protection remain unclear. The results suggest that subtle differences in virus tropism may affect the balance between neuroprotection and neurotoxicity mediated by microglia/macrophages, highlighting the importance of studying in vivo anti-viral mechanisms.
The paper proposes a network modeling approach for controlling the spread of zoonotic diseases, using brucellosis as a case study. The authors develop a layered network model that captures transmission between different species and herds, as well as transmission from animals to humans. They model control capabilities within the animal and human populations, such as vaccination, surveillance, and culling. They use network control theory methods to design optimal control strategies that allocate limited resources in a way that minimizes the spread of the disease, based on the structure of the contact network between species and herds. The approach allows for the design of multiple control strategies for different species and subpopulations, and identifies the tradeoff between controlling transmission within animals versus humans. The authors demonstrate the approach on a brucellosis example and show how control strategies can be designed based on parameter identification from historical data. The paper highlights the potential of network modeling and control theory for comprehensive zoonotic disease control, but stresses the need for experimental validation and social and political considerations.
The paper describes an approach to identify potential drugs for treating trypanosomiasis by repurposing existing mTOR and mTOR/PI3K inhibitors that have shown efficacy in mammalian cells. They tested a series of these compounds against trypanosomatid parasites T. brucei, T. cruzi and Leishmania, and found that the most effective compound, NVP-BEZ25, could significantly reduce parasitemia in an animal model of T. brucei infection, extending survival. While the mechanism of action is not clear, the cell cycle phenotypes of the compounds suggest that they likely inhibit multiple trypanosomal PI3Ks including TOR. Since mTOR/PI3K inhibitors showed generally superior activity against trypanosomatids compared to mTOR-selective inhibitors, the authors suggest that these compounds may target multiple PI3Ks. The study provides a validation for the repurposing approach and identifies NVP-BEZ25 as a promising starting point for further medicinal chemistry efforts.
The paper investigates how Trypanosoma brucei responds to heat shock. While cultured procyclic forms are resistant to heat shock at 4°C, they show signs of stress after a one hour at 39°C. The authors found that mRNAs that are highly translated at 27°C move into the polysomal fraction after heat shock, indicating that translation is inhibited. However, a subset of mRNAs that bind the protein ZC3H1 remain in the polysomal fraction even after heat shock, suggesting that ZC3H1 may protect these mRNAs from degradation and sequestration into stress granules. They also found that mRNAs that are upregulated in salivary gland trypanosomes at 37°C are also increased after heat shock, suggesting that heat shock may promote differentiation to procyclic forms. The study suggests that ZC3H1 plays a role in protecting mRNAs from heat shock stress. The paper concludes that heat shock may promote differentiation in tset flies, but the specific stimuli that induce this differentiation are not well understood.
The paper discusses how the local environment of the host can modulate the activity of antibiotics against bacterial pathogens. The authors used a 3D lung epithelial cell model to simulate the in vivo microenvironment and found that host secretions from these cells can enhance the activity of certain antibiotics. They found that the host metabolites secreted by the epithelial cells, such as pyruvate, succinate and glutamate, can increase the intracellular pH and thus the PMF of the bacteria, leading to increased antibiotic uptake and activity. This enhancement of antibiotic activity was observed across multiple bacterial species, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The authors suggest that supplementing specific metabolites or stimulating host metabolism may be a relevant approach to treat or prevent bacterial infections. The study highlights the importance of tissue homeostasis in the innate defense against pathogens and that changes in the host microenvironment can impact antibiotic activity.
The paper describes a method to map the position of in vivo transcription termination sites of Polymerase II in yeast cells. The authors used PAR-CLIP, a technique that crosslinks Pol II to nascent RNA after depletion of termination factors, to map the position of termination sites. They found that depletion of the factor Ysh1, which cleaves the 5' end of pre-mRNA, leads to an increase in Pol II accumulation at the 3' end of protein-coding genes. Depletion of Nrd1, which recognizes and terminates non-coding RNAs, leads to readthrough transcription of these RNAs. Depletion of the DNA/RNA helicase Sen1, which also terminates non-coding RNAs, does not affect protein-coding gene termination. The results suggest a two-step model of termination involving both allosteric and torpedo mechanisms, where Pol II pauses before being released from the template. The data highlight the roles of Nrd1 and Sen1 in recognizing different types of termination sites and the importance of Nrd1 in coupling termination to RNA turnover. The method provides a new way to study the mechanisms of termination genome-wide.
The paper discusses the mechanism by which PI3K promotes cell survival through its protein kinase activity. The authors found that PI3K protein kinase activity can phosphorylate the cytokine receptor Ser585 in the cytoplasmic tail of the βc receptor subunit of GM-CSF and IL-3 receptor, which in turn activates downstream signaling pathways that promote cell survival. They identified the p10α catalytic subunit of PI3K as the kinase responsible for Ser585 phosphorylation. Low concentrations of cytokines were able to induce Ser585 phosphorylation in the absence of other biological responses such as proliferation, indicating that this pathway is constitutively activated in leukemia. Inhibition of p10α activity using siRNA or inhibitors resulted in reduced Ser585 phosphorylation and cell death, suggesting that p10α is a potential therapeutic target for leukemia treatment. The authors propose that PI3K protein kinase activity and lipid kinase activity are two distinct modes of signaling, with the former being responsible for the survival-only response. The ability of PI3K to switch between protein kinase and lipid kinase activities allows the two enzymatic activities to be perturbed and hijacked in cancer. Further investigation of protein substrates of PI3K that are constitutively phosphorylated in cancer may reveal useful biomarkers and therapeutic targets for PI3K-pathway drug development.
The paper describes an analysis of the effects of mutating various factors involved in the RNA polymerase II transcription termination pathway on the entire yeast transcriptome. The authors used high-density microarrays to measure the relative abundance of RNA transcripts in mutant strains containing mutations in the factors Sen1, Nrd1, Nab3, Ssu7, Rpb1, and Hrp1, and Rpb1, and found that each factor has a distinct set of targets that are affected. Sen1 is the most broadly required for termination, affecting most of the short snoRNA genes, while the other factors have a more limited impact. The results show that some snoRNAs are readthrough in mutants of Sen1, indicating that Sen1 recognizes specific targets directly. The study also identified several novel targets of Sen1-dependent termination that were not previously known, including protein-coding genes that are upregulated in the absence of antisense transcripts. The results suggest that the Sen1 pathway plays a complex role in regulating gene expression, with multiple specificity factors beyond Nrd1 and Nab3 that are required for Sen1-dependent termination.
This paper proposes a mathematical model to study the emergence of resistance to targeted anti-cancer therapy, where resistance arises due to a single genetic alteration. The model incorporates the effect of inhibition of sensitive cell proliferation as well as drug-induced death. The authors derive analytical approximations for the probability of resistance and the expected size of resistant cells under different dosing schedules. They then propose a methodology to identify optimal dosing strategies that minimize the probability of resistance, maximally delay disease progression, and control the expected size of the resistant population. They test the sensitivity of the optimal dosing strategies to variations in parameters and toxicity constraints. The results show that optimal dosing strategies are strongly affected by the degree of convexity of the toxicity curve, highlighting the importance of determining accurate toxicity constraints. The authors stress the need for more detailed toxicity data to inform experimental studies and estimate parameters of the model. The methodology can be applied to various cancer types and treatment options.
This paper investigates the role of superoxide dismutases (SOD) in the dimorphic fungus Paracoccidioides. The authors identify six SOD isoforms encoded by the Paracoccidioides genome and analyze their expression in different conditions, including during growth, morphological transitions, and interactions with host cells. They find that PbSOD3 is the most highly expressed SOD isoform in the yeast phase of Paracoccidioides, and that PbSOD1 and PbSOD3 are differentially expressed between yeast and mycelia cells, with PbSOD3 being more expressed in yeast cells. PbSOD3 expression is also induced during interactions with host cells, particularly macrophages, indicating that it may play a role in protecting Paracoccidioides against oxidative stress generated by metabolism and host defense mechanisms. They generate SOD knockdown strains and show that the knockdown strains have reduced vitality and sensitivity to oxidative stress, suggesting that PbSOD3 is important for Paracoccidioides virulence. The results suggest that SOD3 may play a role in either establishing the infection or disseminating the fungus, while SOD1 may be required for fungal dissemination.
The paper describes a standardized endocystomy technique for treating uncomplicated hepatic echinococococcosis in patients. The technique aims to remove all biologically active cyst content from the residual cavity and prevent intraabdominal and intravascular spillage of infectious material to prevent local and systemic recurrence. The technique includes a supraumbilical laparotomy incision, mobilization of the liver, intraoperative ultrasound to confirm cyst locations and size, partial evacuation of the cyst content, and closure of cysto-biliary fistulas. The technique was used on 21 patients with 47 cysts. The study found that the technique was effective in preventing surgical complications and bile leakage, with no recurrences during the follow-up period. However, longer follow-ups are needed to accurately determine the recurrence rates of hepatic echinococococcosis treated with conservative and radical surgical procedures. The standardized technique provides a framework for surgical treatment of echinococococcosis that can be adapted to different healthcare settings, improving outcomes worldwide.
The paper describes the anti-Ebola virus activity of H84T BanLec, a lectin that has been engineered to retain broad-spectrum antiviral activity while removing mitogenicity. H84T was shown to inhibit Ebola virus infection in cell cultures and mice, blocking both entry and transcription/replication phases of the viral life cycle. In cell cultures, H84T inhibited Ebola virus infection more strongly than it inhibited virus entry, indicating that it likely targets the viral glycoprotein on the surface. In mice, a single dose of H84T partially protected mice from lethal Ebola virus infection, suggesting it could potentially be used as an empiric anti-Ebola virus treatment. However, the exact mechanism of action of H84T remains unclear and further research is needed to determine why H84T is more potent against other viruses than Ebola virus and how it binds to Ebola virus glycoproteins. H84T could potentially be used in combination with other anti-Ebola virus agents to reduce the amount of H84T needed. The paper concludes that H84T holds promise as an anti-Ebola virus prophylactic/therapeutic agent, but more research is needed to determine its full potential.
The paper investigates the developmental trajectory of audio-visual integration in children, specifically looking at how children integrate visual and auditory information to estimate a continuous quantity. The study found that children do not show optimal integration of the two modalities until around age 10 years, instead showing sub-optimal behavior in which they switch between the two modalities based on their relative reliabilities. Children showed stronger cross-sensory interactions than older observers, but did not ignore the task-irrelevant modality as expected. The results suggest that children's ability to integrate audio-visual information may be beneficial during early childhood for recalibration and sensory development, but integration emerges later as they learn the correspondence between sensory signals. The study employed a simple counting task with visual and auditory stimuli, and found that variance in the bi-modal estimates was reduced compared to uni-modal estimates, indicating some degree of integration. However, the integration was sub-optimal, showing stronger cross-modal interactions and a lack of ignoring the task-irrelevant modality. The results suggest that integration of audio-visual information does not emerge until around age 10 years and is followed by a period of sub-optimal behavior, which may be beneficial for sensory development.
The paper describes the results of a study on neurons in the lateral hypothalamus (LH) of mice that were genetically labeled to express green fluorescent protein (GFP) specifically in neurons of the Nts subtype (Nts). The study found that Nts neurons are densely packed in the perifornical LH and intermingle with orexin and MCH neurons. While some Nts neurons express orexin, none of the GFP+ neurons were labeled for MCH. To determine if the lack of MCH expression in Nts neurons was due to developmental expression, the authors stereotaxically injected a Cre-dependent adeno-associated virus containing mCherry into Nts-GFP mice. The virus did not produce any double-labeled neurons in the LH, indicating that Nts neurons are a distinct population from orexin and MCH neurons. To understand the projections of NtsLH neurons, the authors used conditional anterograde tracing and optogenetic and chemogenetic tools to identify the neuronal targets of NtsLH neurons. The results showed that NtsLH neurons project to the ventral tegmental nucleus of the basal ganglia, ventrolateral preoptic nucleus, lateral preoptic nucleus, retrorubral region, subthalamic nucleus, parabrachial nucleus, locus coeruleus, and ventromedial preoptic nucleus, and lateral preoptic nucleus. The authors also found that chemogenetic activation of NtsLH neurons resulted in rapid transitions to wake from NREM sleep but not from REM sleep, while optogenetic activation of NtsLH neurons resulted in prolonged wakefulness and hyperactivity. Chemical inhibition of NtsLH neurons attenuated the arousal and hyperthermia response to psychological stress but amplified the sleep-wake responses to metabolic stress. The results suggest that NtsLH neurons are capable of initiating and sustaining wakefulness and increasing Tb and LMA, and are necessary for modulating sleep-wake states in response to physiological and metabolic demands.
The paper discusses a general formula for calculating the "structural dominance factor" which determines which strategy is more abundant in a population of individuals in the limit of weak selection. The factor depends on the population structure, mutation rate, and population size, but not on the payoff values between the strategies. The formula is derived through a simple numerical algorithm that simulates the evolutionary dynamics over many generations and calculates the average number of interactions between individuals of the same strategy. The formula is shown to hold for games on sets, games in phenotype space, and games in structured populations. The authors demonstrate that the factor can be used to calculate the critical benefit-cost ratio for cooperation, which determines whether cooperation or defection is more abundant in the population. The formula provides an efficient numerical method for calculating this quantity. The results are compared to exact analytical solutions in the original models and show good agreement. The formula also reveals an intermediate mutation rate where the global and local updating strategies are similar.
The paper presents GlobalFit, a novel algorithm that can automatically modify a metabolic network model based on inconsistencies between model predictions and experimental data. It uses a bi-level optimization approach where the model is optimized simultaneously across all experimental conditions and network modifications. This allows it to find a globally minimal set of network changes that resolves all inconsistencies, even when the number of experiments is large. The algorithm can also find a subset of optimal or suboptimal solutions that best agree with available evidence. The authors demonstrate the utility of this approach by applying it to two genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions, Mycoplasma genitalium and Escherichia coli. For Mycoplasma genitalium, they were able to significantly improve the accuracy of predictions by adding reversible reactions and removing biomass components. For Escherichia coli, they found a conservative set of modifications that resolved false predictions while maintaining a high accuracy. The approach can also identify alternative solutions that are compatible with available evidence and can be used to guide experimental validation. The authors show that the number of binary variables depends on the number of experiments considered, but by restricting the examined conditions, they can speed up the search for a globally optimal solution.
The paper proposes a novel mechanism for how the brain's superior olivary neurons (MSONs) localize sound sources along the horizontal plane based on differences in the time of arrival of sound at the two ears. The authors find that MSONs are able to distinguish microsecond differences in the arrival time of sound at the two ears, which allows them to encode interaural time differences (ITDs) and detect the horizontal position of sound sources. They show that this is based on an arrangement of axonal delay lines in the auditory system. However, the actual path length between the two ears is longer for the contralateral path, which causes MSONs to fire mostly to ITDs that are outside the physiological range of ±130 μs. To compensate for this difference, the authors propose that the rising slope of excitatory synaptic inputs to MSONs determines the firing probability, not just the absolute latency difference. The authors find that MSONs have steeper rising slopes for inputs from the ipsilateral ear, which allows them to fire more easily when a faster input arrives first. They show that this asymmetry in excitatory synaptic inputs can shift the ITD response function to the physiological range. This mechanism allows the brain to encode ITDs in the biologically relevant range, even though the path length between the ears is different.
The paper reports the results of a genome-wide association study and replication of genetic variants associated with serum IgE levels in a population of German adults. The study identified a susceptibility locus on chromosome 1q21 encoding the alpha chain of the high affinity receptor for IgE (FCER1A), which is a key receptor for IgE-induced type I hypersensitivity reactions and plays a central role in the regulation of IgE levels. The top associated variant, rs24273, was found to have an estimated effect of -0.12% decrease in IgE levels for the rare homozygote genotype and 3.6% for the heterozygote genotype. Additional fine-mapping of the region revealed that the strongest association was with the proximal promoter region of FCER1A, which contains the variant rs25746. The study also identified variants in the RAD50 gene on chromosome 5q31, which was previously linked to IgE levels, but the source of the association was unclear due to linkage disequilibrium with the IL13 gene. The findings suggest that genetic variants in FCER1A and RAD50 may contribute to the regulation of serum IgE levels. The study replicated the association of the STAT6 locus, which has been previously linked to the regulation of IgE. The results provide evidence that genetic variants in FCER1A and RAD50 may influence serum IgE levels, highlighting the need for further functional studies to confirm the causal role of these genes.
The paper describes the identification and characterization of a novel apoplastic effector protein, Cip1, from the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000. The authors used a competitive activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) approach to screen a collection of putative small non-annotated secreted proteins from the P. syringae genome to identify proteins that inhibit apoplastic proteases, and found that Cip1 inhibits the immune protease C14 and other proteases. Cip1 is a chagasin-like protein that contains a chagasin motif, NPTG, which is important for its inhibitory activity. The authors showed that Cip1 can distinguish between the apoplastic proteases Pip1 and Rcr3, and inhibits both at different efficiencies. Cip1 contributes to the virulence of P. syringae on tomato by inhibiting secreted host proteases that would otherwise suppress bacterial growth. The study demonstrates that apoplast effectors produced by bacteria can manipulate the apoplast and provide protection against host proteases, and highlights the potential for using ABPP to identify novel apoplast effectors.
This paper investigates the role of Parp3 in B cell immunoglobulin diversification. The authors find that Parp3 is a negative regulator of immunoglobulin light chain (IgH) class switch recombination (CSR). They show that Parp3-deficient B cells undergo increased CSR efficiency, which is not due to increased cell proliferation or overexpression of Parp1 or Parp2. Parp3 is found to control the level of activated AID at the IgH locus, which in turn leads to increased DNA damage at the switch regions. This increased DNA damage leads to increased microhomology-mediated repair of breaks and enhanced CSR. Parp3 also favors accurate NHEJ repair over end-resection, consistent with its role in promoting accurate repair of DNA double-strand breaks. The results provide evidence for Parp3's involvement in the classical NHEJ pathway and a novel mechanism of CSR regulation by controlling AID occupancy at the IgH locus.
The paper proposes a Kuramoto model as a mathematical framework to study how large-scale brain networks can exhibit hypersynchrony, which is a hallmark of seizures. The model is used to derive functional networks from EEG recordings and the authors find that the critical coupling strength required for global synchrony is significantly lower in EEG recordings from people with idiopathic generalized epilepsy compared to controls, indicating that networks in epilepsy have more strongly connected components. Additionally, they find that left frontal brain regions are more likely to drive global synchrony when self-synchronized, consistent with prior studies. This suggests that structural abnormalities in the frontal regions may contribute to the increased seizure propensity in epilepsy. The study demonstrates the potential of using mathematical modeling to analyze routine clinical EEG recordings as a diagnostic tool for identifying seizure propensity and could complement existing imaging modalities like fMRI.
The paper investigated the potential of using the TcpA-A2-CTB chimera and TcpA+CT chimera as subunit vaccines against Vibrio cholerae in the infant mouse model. The authors found that immunizing dams with these chimera or chimera containing TcpA and CTB resulted in significantly higher levels of anti-TcpA and anti-CTB antibodies in their pups compared to immunization with TcpA or CTB alone. In particular, the TcpA-A2-CT chimera was found to be more effective at inducing these antibodies, and pups immunized with the chimera or chimera had significantly higher survival rates compared to pups immunized with TcpA or CTB alone when challenged with a lethal dose of V. cholera. The authors conclude that anti-TcpA and anti-CTB antibodies synergize to protect pups against V. cholera, and that using a TcpA-CT chimera or TcpA+CT chimera as a vaccine formulation could potentially provide broader protection against different V. cholera strains. However, further studies are needed to determine if these vaccines could be effective in humans and to optimize their composition and delivery.
The paper discusses how drug-resistant HIV mutations can persist in patients even in the absence of drug pressure. The study aimed to determine the persistence times of transmitted drug-resistant mutations (TDRM) in an epidemiological approach in order to assess their fitness costs, which could influence their ability to revert. The study analyzed 17 TDRM from 197 patients, using genotyping data from routine clinical testing. The results showed that reversion rates of individual TDRM varied substantially, and were significantly associated with the predicted fitness costs of the mutations. The study found that the genetic background of a resistance mutation substantially modulated the fitness cost and thereby the reversion rate of the mutation. The authors suggest that this suggests that heritable variation in the fitness cost of resistance could lead to the spread of low-fitness-cost resistance mutations in the long term, which could be a problem in settings with poor surveillance. The results provide a proof of principle for using machine-learning approaches to bridge the gap between in vitro fitness measurements and epidemiological data on resistance reversion. The study highlights the importance of assessing the fitness costs of resistance mutations in order to understand their potential impact on the spread of antimicrobial resistance.
This paper explores how variations in the promoter region of genes that encode killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) on natural killer cells affect their expression and function. The authors identify promoter polymorphisms in the KIR3DL1, KIR2DL3, and KIR2DL4 genes that affect the frequency of expression of these receptors on natural killer cells. They find that different alleles of these genes have distinct forward and reverse promoter activities, which in turn affects the frequency of expression. Higher forward promoter activity is associated with lower frequency of expression, while higher reverse promoter activity is associated with higher frequency of expression. They also find that variations in the Y1 and Sp1 sites flanking the promoter region affect promoter activity. This study suggests that the probability of transcription in the sense or antisense direction is controlled by these flanking sites, and that polymorphisms in these sites can affect the frequency of expression of KIR genes. The authors propose that antisense transcription may antagonize sense transcription from the upstream promoter, although they note that additional factors beyond promoter polymorphisms may also contribute to the observed differences in expression frequency. This study provides a mechanistic explanation for how variations in KIR gene expression can affect natural killer cell function and immune responses.
This paper presents the results of a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of follicular lymphoma (FL) and other B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) subtypes. The study identified two novel genetic associations with the HLA class II region, specifically the SNPs rs264712 and rs10456. The SNP rs26472 was found to be independently associated with FL risk, while the SNP rs10456 was associated with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The study also found that the SNP rs10456 was associated with risk of DLBCL, suggesting a shared biological mechanism between the two NHL subtypes. The study suggests that genetic variation in the HLA class II molecules may play an important role in the pathogenesis of both FL and DLBCL. The study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying these lymphoma subtypes and suggests that future genetic and functional work in the HLA class II region may provide important insight into their disease pathology.
The paper discusses the genetic mechanisms of antimony resistance in Leishmania guyanensis parasites from the Viania subgenus. The authors used whole genome sequencing to identify genetic changes in four antimony-resistant mutants of L. guyanensis. They found that the mutants had increased copy number of certain chromosomes, including chromosome 19, which was amplified in a subtelomeric region, and chromosome 23, which had a large amplified region containing the gene MRPA associated with antimony resistance. They also found that the loss of the gene coding for the aquaglyceroporin AQP1 was associated with antimony resistance. They demonstrated that the G13D mutation in AQP1 could also be a novel mechanism of antimony resistance. The study highlights that gene amplification and loss of AQP1 are common mechanisms of antimony resistance in Leishmania, but occurs differently in the two subgenera. The loss of AQP1 led to reduced antimony uptake, while the amplification of chromosome 23 was associated with increased drug sequestration by the protein MRPA. The study suggests that the loss of AQP1 may be a dominant mechanism of antimony resistance in L. guyanensis.
This paper investigates the role of RhoJ in melanocyte survival and tumor growth. The authors find that RhoJ is specifically required for the growth and survival of melanocytes in BRAF mutant tumors, particularly during the early stages of tumor development. RhoJ knockout mice have reduced tumor growth and a lower tumor burden compared to wild-type mice, indicating that RhoJ is a critical dependency in BRAF mutant melanomas. Treatment with a PAK inhibitor that targets RhoJ signaling can inhibit the growth of early stage BRAF mutant tumors, suggesting that targeting RhoJ may be an effective therapeutic approach. The study identifies RhoJ as a novel "non-oncogene" dependence in melanoma that allows BRAF mutant cells to proliferate. The authors propose that RhoJ modulates the growth and apoptotic threshold of BRAF mutant melanocytes by altering metabolic pathways and avoiding apoptosis. The study suggests that RhoJ-PAK signaling may be a promising therapeutic target for early stage melanoma.
The paper describes the discovery of a new class of bifunctional enzymes called MprF lipid-biosynthetic enzymes that mediate the synthesis of anionic lipids called Lys-PG. These enzymes have two distinct domains: an N-terminal hydrophobic domain that facilitates translocation of Lys-PG from the inner membrane to the outer membrane, and a C-terminal hydrophilic domain that synthesizes the lipid. The study shows that while the C-terminal domain is dispensable for Lys-PG biosynthesis, it is essential for translocating Lys-PG to the outer membrane, where it can confer resistance to antimicrobial peptides. The N-terminal domain is found to have basic properties that allow it to interact with the polyanionic ribonucleic acid substrate, while the C-terminal domain is required for translocation. The enzymes can be separated into two functional proteins, one for Lys-PG synthesis and one for lipid translocation. The study provides a basis for the search for inhibitors of these enzymes that could render a wide range of bacteria susceptible to endogenous host defense mechanisms and cationic antibiotics like daptomycin. The findings suggest that MprF-like enzymes may represent a promising new strategy for antibacterial chemotherapy.
The paper discusses the potential of using specialized type VII secretion systems (T7SS) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis as vaccine candidates to induce immunity against the bacterium. The authors show that M. tuberculosis has five clusters of highly conserved genes that encode specialized T7SS, some of which are conserved in other mycobacteria. They find that genetically modifying M. tuberculosis strains to express these genes can produce and secrete immunogenic factors that can induce protective immunity. They specifically identify a strain called M. tuberculosis Δppe25-pe19 that lacks five of these genes as a promising vaccine candidate. They show that this strain is able to secrete proteins encoded outside the five genes and thus induces cross-reactive immunity against these proteins, which are also present in the wild type strain. They demonstrate that immunity to these proteins is required for protection against M. tuberculosis. They also show that M. tuberculosisΔppe25-pe19 is able to induce secretion of ESX-1 substrates and thereby establish phagosomal rupture, which is important for innate immune responses. They conclude that the unique properties of M. tuberculosisΔppe25-pe19 make it a promising vaccine candidate.
The paper describes the results of experiments testing a 3CLpro inhibitor, GC376, in cats with naturally occurring feline coronavirus infection. The inhibitor was shown to be safe and well-tolerated in cats and effective at reversing the progression of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) even when treatment was started at an advanced clinical stage. The virus titers in macrophages from the ascites and omentum of infected cats decreased with antiviral treatment. Resistant viruses were selected in serial passage experiments, but the mutations did not confer cross-resistance to GC376. These results suggest that GC376 may be a promising candidate for developing a safe and effective drug for feline coronavirus infections. The 3CLpro inhibitor has broad activity against important human coronaviruses including MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, suggesting the inhibitor series may serve as a platform for further optimization for those viruses. The findings suggest similar intervention approaches targeting 3CLpro may be effective for other coronavirus infections.
The paper investigates the relationship between a measure of genetic autozygosity, called Froh, and schizophrenia. Froh is the proportion of an individual's genome that exists in runs of homozygosity (ROHs) across the genome. The authors analyze genotype data from 17 schizophrenia case-control datasets and find that higher levels of Froh are associated with a higher risk of schizophrenia, suggesting that autozygosity may be a risk factor for the disorder. However, the association between Froh and schizophrenia is not strong and the authors cannot definitively distinguish between the effects of distant vs. close inbreeding on autozygosity. They conclude that both distant and close inbreeding may contribute to schizophrenia risk, but suggest that distant inbreeding may be a more important factor due to the greater number of common haplotypes that can be inherited from distant ancestors. The authors also find that the genetic variants that contribute to schizophrenia risk are likely to be recessive, which could explain why autozygosity is associated with a higher risk of schizophrenia. The study highlights the potential role of genetic autozygosity in schizophrenia and suggests that alleles that increase risk may have been under negative selection in the past. However, the results are limited by differences in genotyping platforms and sample collection methods across the datasets, which could introduce noise and biases.
The paper discusses how genome reduction through the loss of accessory genes can contribute to adaptation and specialization in bacteria. The authors used experimental evolution to investigate this process in the bacterium Methylobacterium extorquens AM1, which can grow on a limited range of substrates. They found that 80% of a genomic region containing up to 10% of the genome was repeatedly deleted in 32 populations evolved under different nutrient conditions. Analysis of the deletions showed that the benefits of these deletions were specific to the genes lost, not just a result of a shorter genome length. The deletions were found to confer benefits in the selective environments, including increased resistance to antibiotics and growth at high temperatures. The megaplasmid region, which was repeatedly deleted, contained redundant copies of essential genes on the main chromosome. The results suggest that selection-driven loss of accessory genes can lead to a limited niche and path to further genome changes, with tradeoffs in growth capacity and stress response. While genome reduction through drift may initiate specialization, the authors argue that the large-scale deletion of unnecessary genes through selection can be a key mechanism towards a restricted niche and path to further genome changes.
The paper investigates the association between diabetes mellitus (DM) and the risk of active tuberculosis (TB). While previous studies have shown that DM increases the risk of TB, the relationship is not uniform across all DM patients. The paper finds that DM patients with poor glycemic control (FPG >130 mg/dl) have a higher risk of TB compared to those with good glycemic control (FPG ≤130 mg/dl). The study suggests that improving glycemic control in DM patients may reduce the risk of TB, although the exact mechanism is not clear. The paper concludes that improving glycemic control could potentially modify the higher TB risk among DM patients, and that more efforts should be made to link DM and TB control programs to leverage their overall impact.
The paper discusses how three species of Drosophila (D. melanogaster, D. simulans, and D. mauritiana) were able to rapidly evolve resistance to the parasitoid wasp L. boulardi. Despite the cost of resistance, which included reduced larval competitiveness, the populations showed an increase in circulating hemocytes. The authors found that the developmental basis of this increase in circulating hemocytes differed between species, with D. melanogaster moving hemocytes from sessile clusters into circulation, while D. simulans and D. mauritiana increased the total number of hemocytes produced. The gain in resistance was associated with a decline in larval competitiveness in all species, especially when resources were scarce. The authors suggest that the cost of resistance likely results from autoimmune damage, which is more pronounced when resources are limited. The results suggest that the evolution of resistance is constrained by resource availability and parasite pressure, rather than just parasite pressure alone. The paper highlights that different species evolve resistance by investing in cellular immunity, and that this cost may be a universal trait. The findings provide insights into how natural populations maintain genetic variation in susceptibility to infection and how parasites evolve resistance to immune defenses.
The paper evaluates various immunodiagnostic tests for the detection of Schistosoma japonicum infection in China. After reviewing the performance of 9 immunodiagnostic tests in a laboratory setting using well-characterized serum specimens, the authors prioritized the IHA_JX, DIGFA_SH, and ELISA_S tests for further field trials due to their good sensitivity, specificity, ease of use, and lack of equipment requirements. The EITB test was also identified as a potential reference method for confirming S. japonicum infections in low transmission settings. The authors note that while the sensitivities of the tests varied, the specificities of the IHA_XY test were significantly lower than those of the other tests, indicating cross-reactivity with other parasitic infections. The tests were also found to have good reproducibility and ease of use. The paper concludes that immunodiagnostic tests with good sensitivity and specificity, but simplicity and ease of use, could be useful for schistosomiasis control in China, especially in areas with low prevalence.
The paper presents a new mouse model of female genital schistosomiasis (FGS) that can be used to study the immunological changes and genitourinary symptoms associated with Schistosoma haematobium infection. The model involves injecting live S. haematobium eggs directly into the vaginal submucosa of female mice. This results in granulomatous lesions, similar to those seen in human FGS, and urinary frequency. The model does not reproduce the full pathology of FGS, as it does not induce vaginal mucosal lesions or sandy patches. However, it does show that S. haematobium eggs can induce systemic immune responses and increase the numbers of HIV target cells in vaginal tissue, which could increase susceptibility to HIV transmission. The authors suggest that the model may be useful for investigating the evolution of FGS lesions and the relationship between FGS and HIV co-infection.
The paper describes the discovery of a previously unknown node that eukaryotes use to sense nutrient status and coordinate energy metabolism and anabolism. Calcium-binding protein 1 (CAPER) is shown to be a master regulator that senses extracellular nutrient levels and regulates nuclear and mitochondrial transcription factors to maintain energy homeostasis and protect against oxidative stress. CAPER is induced when glucose levels increase and stimulates nuclear factors to activate mitochondrial transcription factors, enhancing mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation. CAPER also regulates anaplerotic carbon metabolism from amino acids and glutamine to replenish the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The study demonstrates that CAPER is required for coordinating carbon and nitrogen metabolism, maintaining a balanced ratio of macronutrients and providing carbon flux to support ATP production and cellular metabolism. The data suggests that CAPER may be a key node that has evolved to coordinate nutrient utilization, anabolism and stress resistance, allowing organisms to optimize energy metabolism in response to changing environmental conditions. The study proposes that CAPER's role in coordinating energy metabolism and anabolism may be a key factor in species survival and longevity.
This paper describes a genome-wide association study and functional genomics analysis of kidney function in African Americans. The authors aimed to identify genetic loci associated with kidney function measures like estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), urinary albuminuria (UACR), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). They analyzed genotype data from 4000 African Americans genotyped on the Illumina OmniExpress array and 8000 African Americans genotyped on the Affymetrix 6.0 array. They found 3 suggestive loci associated with eGFR and 3 with UACR, including KCNQ1, DOK6, and FNDC1. Functional studies in zebrafish showed that loss of KCNQ1 leads to abnormalities in glomerular gene expression and filtration. These findings provide evidence that genes associated with polygenic conditions can produce developmental phenotypes when knocked down in vivo. The authors also found that genetic loci identified in European ancestry populations may have different functional implications in African Americans. The study demonstrates the importance of studying genetic loci in African Americans to gain a better understanding of the underpinnings of kidney disease in this population.
The paper describes the development of mouse models of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in NOD/Shi-scid/IL-2Rγnull (NOG) mice to study the pathogenesis of EBV-associated T-cell and natural killer cell lymphoproliferative disorders, including chronic EBV infection (CAEBV) and EBV-associated hemophagocytic lymphocytosis (EBV-HL). PBMC from patients with CAEBV and EBV-HL were injected into NOG mice, and EBV DNA was detected in the peripheral blood, spleen, liver and lungs of the mice. The models showed that EBV-infected T and NK cells required CD4+ T cells for engraftment in NOG mice, and the CD4+ T cells were essential for the outgrowth of EBV-infected T and NK cells. The xenograft models were able to reproduce the characteristic pathological findings of CAEBV and EBV-HL, including splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, hemorrhages and high levels of cytokines. The findings suggest that EBV-infected T and NK cells are not truly malignant but are inhibited from being removed by the host immune system, possibly due to a genetic defect in genes involved in immune responses. The study provides a useful animal model to test novel therapies for CAEBV and EBV-HL.
The paper investigates the diversity of the Opa proteins of Neisseria meningitidis, which mediate adhesion and invasion of the human nasopharyngeal epithelium, and how it relates to the clonal complexes of the bacteria. The Opa repertoire consists of 3-4 loci and is highly diverse with 76 HV variants (amino acid differences) and 4 HV variants (amino acid differences) in the 222 isolates from the Czech Republic. However, within individual repertoires, there is a non-overlapping structure and low diversity, indicating strong immune selection is shaping the repertoire. This is consistent with a model of immune selection that shows a tendency to self-organize into discrete antigenic types as immune pressure increases. The study finds that only a fraction of possible HV1/HV2 combinations are observed, with dominant combinations of HV1/HV2 being favored due to the host immunity. Within individual repertoires, more identical HV combinations are found than expected, indicating that multiple opa loci are expressed in vivo. The authors propose that this reduction in diversity within individual repertoires may be due to the host's immunological responses, as multiple variants may be recognized by immunologically naive hosts. The study suggests that a more diverse Opa repertoire may be advantageous for transmission in low-prevalence populations, while a reduced repertoire may be more costly in high-prevalence populations.
The paper describes a study on the transcriptional regulatory circuitry that controls adherence of Candida albicans to surfaces, which is the first step in biofilm formation. The authors used a nanoString profiling approach to analyze the expression of 30 transcription factor mutants that have reduced adherence to identify new adherence regulators. They found that 12 transcription factors govern expression of over 25% of the Candida albicans cell surface genes. The transcription factor Snf5, which functions in chromatin remodeling, is required for cell-substrate adherence. They also identified a regulatory network involving the transcription factors Bcr1, Ace2, and Zap1 that controls adherence and biofilm formation. They found that Zap1 overexpression can restore adherence in mutants with adherence defects, suggesting that it mediates the effects of Snf5. The analysis identified a group of 37 cell surface genes that are coordinately regulated by the 12 transcription factors, which may couple cell adherence to environmental signals. The results provide new insights into the mechanisms of Candida albicans biofilm formation and suggest potential therapeutic strategies. The study also identified Zap1 as a key regulator of adherence and biofilm formation.
This paper describes a study that aimed to describe the clinical, radiological, and laboratory features of extraparenchymal necystic cysticercosis (ExPNCC) compared to parenchymal necystic cysticercosis (ParNCC). The study included 429 patients with ExPNCC and 191 ParNCC diagnosed at the Instituto Nacional de Neurología y Neurociría in Mexico City. The main findings were that patients with ExPNCC were significantly older at diagnosis, had higher intracranial hypertension, inflammatory CSF, and racemose cysts, and were more likely to have vesicular parasites. In contrast, patients with ParNCC had seizures and were diagnosed at a younger age. The distribution of parasite degeneration stages also differed between the two groups, with vesicular parasites being more common in ExPNCC and the most common stage in ParNCC being calcification. The results suggest that the location of the parasites in the central nervous system determines the clinical presentation, inflammatory response and treatment outcomes of the disease. The authors conclude that parasite location should be considered a key factor in diagnosing and treating necysticercosis.
This paper investigated the phylogenetics and molecular epidemiology of Yersinia pestis in Madagascar using a combination of SNP and MLVA genotyping of 262 isolates from 25 districts from 1939-205. The researchers found a high level of genetic diversity among the isolates with 26 MLVA genotypes and 15 subclades that showed significant geographic separation. MLVA identified genetic groups, but the relationships among those groups remained unclear. SNPs were used to confirm the major genetic groups identified by MLVA, and provide resolution within those groups. The researchers found that plague is maintained in multiple geographically separated subpopulations in Madagascar, likely due to the limited mobility of the primary host species, the black rat, and human-mediated transport of plague. Plague is primarily spread through the natural cycle between the black rat and flea vectors, but human activities allow for long distance transfers of infected rats and fleas. Multiple subclades were identified in cities and communes, with some becoming established in new locations. The successful establishment of some subclades may be due to adaptive advantages, but it is unclear whether this is the case for the subclade found in Mahajanga. The research suggests that the central highlands remain the most active plague focus in Madagascar and that plague is maintained in multiple genetically distinct subpopulations, with the exact geographic distribution changing over time.
The paper investigates the role of catalase in the midgut of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in response to blood feeding. The authors found that blood feeding induces antioxidant protection in the midgut epithelial cells, which reduces oxidative stress and the susceptibility of mosquitoes to hydrogen peroxide. They showed that silencing catalase through RNA interference reduces the midgut susceptibility to Dengue-4 virus, but not Zika virus infection. This suggests that the midgut infection barrier, which prevents the initial contact between virions and intestinal epithelial cells, may be altered by catalase silencing. The study suggests that the midgut antioxidant response may play a role in mosquito immunity to Dengue virus, but not Zika virus. The findings highlight the complex interplay between redox metabolism and immune responses in mosquito-arbovirus interactions and suggest that antioxidant enzymes may be an underappreciated factor in controlling flavivirus infection.
This paper describes the molecular mechanism by which the chromatin remodeler Snf2 reposition chromatin nucleosomes along DNA. The authors used coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the role of the inchworm motion of the translocase domain in inducing nucleosome sliding. They found that the translocase motion is coupled to the formation and propagation of twist defects starting from the remodeler binding site at SHL 2. The initial ATP binding and translocase closure weakens the electrostatic interactions between lobe 1 and SHL -6, allowing nucleosomal DNA to slide towards the dyad. The sliding of nucleosomal DNA then causes the translocase to swing towards the dyad, reestablishing the electrostatic contacts. This mechanism is robust against changes in DNA sequence, allowing active repositioning of nucleosomes formed with strong positioning motifs. The authors also showed how DNA sequence can be exploited to control the kinetics of the system, consistent with its role in determining remodeling outcomes. They found that introducing a TpA repeat at SHL 2 inhibits nucleosome repositioning by blocking the twist defect formation, while a poly(dA:dT) tract at SHL 1 slows down sliding. The results provide a mechanistic understanding of the role of electrostatic interactions and twist defects in directing active chromatin remodeling.
The paper describes an investigation of the distribution and genetic characteristics of the mammarenavirus Wenzhou virus (WENV) in Yunnan Province, China. The authors collected small mammals in urban and rural areas of Yunnan Province and detected WENV RNA in liver tissue from 41040 animals of 13 genera and 26 species, including brown rats, oriental rats, Himalayan rats, and tree shrews. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the WENV isolates in Yunnan Province form an independent lineage that is divided into two branches. The authors isolated five full-length genomes and found that the WENV sequences from the same location are highly similar, indicating that the viruses are closely related, regardless of the host species. However, the S segment sequences showed more genetic diversity, suggesting recombination events. The results suggest that brown rats and oriental house rats are the major natural hosts of WENV and the risk of spillover to humans is high. The authors propose an ELISA test for detecting WENV antibodies in undiagnosed fever patients in Yunnan Province. The study highlights the importance of surveillance of mammarenaviruses in both their natural reservoirs and humans to reduce the risk of zoonotic diseases.
This paper investigates the role of chromatin modifications in establishing the bipotential state of gonad cells in mice during sex determination. The authors find that key sex-determining genes are bivalent at the early bipotential stage (E10.5), meaning they have both histone 3 lysine 27 methylation (H3K27me3) and histone 3 lysine 4 methylation (H3K4me3) at their promoters. This bivalent state is maintained throughout cell division and sex determination, even after sex-determining genes become upregulated. However, sex-determining genes that promote the alternate cell fate retain their bivalent marks after differentiation into either Sertoli or pregranosa cells. The authors propose that chromatin repressors, such as the PcG proteins, play a key role in maintaining the bivalent state and repressing the alternate cell fate, and that loss of the chromatin repressor CBx2 leads to upregulation of the ovary pathway and XY sex reversal. They show that CBx2 directly represses the Wnt4 target Lef1 in XY gonads and that loss of Cx2 leads to upregulation of ovary-specific genes. The findings suggest that chromatin repressors maintain the balance between testis and ovary-determining genes and transmission of poised sex-determining genes from the bipotential to differentiated states, allowing for plasticity and transdifferentiation of supporting cell lineages long after sex determination. The study highlights the importance of epigenetic regulation in establishing the bipotential state and resolving sex-determining genes.
This paper reports the discovery of a plant transcription factor called DUET that regulates gene expression during male meiosis in Arabidopsis. The authors identify DUET as a PHD finger protein that binds histone H3K4me2, and they show that loss of DUET leads to deregulated gene expression during male meiosis, including loss of expression of genes required for spindle organization and cell cycle progression. They identify two genes, TDM1 and JAS, that depend on DUET for expression and are lost in duet mutants, which results in meiotic phenotypes such as cytoplasmic collapse and failure to produce pollen. They find that DUET binds the promoter of TDM1 and is required for TDM1 expression during male meiosis. These results suggest that DUET functions as a transcriptional regulator during male meiosis, and histone modifications may play a role in controlling gene expression. The authors identify putative DUET homologs in other plant species, indicating that this function is conserved across plants. Overall, the study provides insight into the molecular mechanisms controlling gene expression during male meiosis and suggests that histone modifications may play a role in regulating meiotic gene expression.
This paper investigated the in vitro response to Leishmania braziliensis in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy individuals, which could be used to predict the pace of the post-vaccination response. The authors found that peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy individuals either produce high or low amounts of IFN-γ upon stimulation with Leishmania antigens. They identified genes that were differentially expressed in response to high or low levels of IFN-γ production and found that the genes that were upregulated in high IFN-γ producers were also expressed in vivo in patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis. The genes that were upregulated in healthy individuals were associated with an inflammatory response and the IL-17-related pathway, while the genes that were upregulated in low IFN-γ producers were associated with a Th2-like response. They hypothesized that the in vitro response could be used to predict the development of cutaneous leishmaniasis and that the in vivo counterparts of high and low IFN-γ producers were patients with subclinical infection and cutaneous leishmaniasis, respectively. The findings suggest that the initial response to Leishmania may play an important role in determining the outcome of the infection.
This paper proposes a model to explain how microtubules coordinate contractile ring assembly during cytokinesis in silkworm spermatocytes. The model posits that microtubules play opposing roles in two pathways: polar relaxation and equatorial stimulation. Dynamic astral microtubules at the poles inhibit ectopic furrow formation by excluding pre-existing actin filaments from the poles, while stable central spindle microtubules assemble new actin aggregates de novo and deliver them to the equator. As the cell progresses towards telophase, pre-existing cortical actin filaments continue to flow from the poles to the equator. The newly delivered actin aggregates coalesce with the actin excluded from the poles to assemble the contractile ring. This dual signaling mechanism ensures fidelity of cytokinesis and redundancy, as both mechanisms are needed for proper cell division. The authors demonstrate through experiments that actin is redistributed into the contractile ring via two microtubule-dependent pathways: equatorial stimulation by dynamic astral microtubules and polar relaxation by stable central spindle microtubules. The authors show that cortical actin is redistributed by cortical flow and newly assembled actin aggregates by de novo actin assembly. They propose a microtubule-induction model to describe the opposing roles of microtubules in the two pathways.
The paper investigates trends in dementia incidence rates in a large Dutch population of community-dwelling older adults over 60 years old, using data from general practitioner (GP) registries. The study found that dementia incidence rates increased by approximately 2% per year over the 23 year period between 1992 and 2014, with higher incidence among women than men. The increase in incidence was observed across all age groups, although the highest age groups contributed most to the positive trend. The study found no significant change in the trend after the launch of a national dementia care program in 2003, despite improved awareness and care initiatives. While the absolute increase in dementia incidence rates is small, the findings suggest that the burden of caring for newly diagnosed dementia patients in primary care practices has not decreased, as the population ages and the absolute capacity required for dementia care is expected to double every 20 years. The study highlights the need for further research to understand the complex factors driving trends in dementia incidence.
The paper investigates the role of a protein called 2B4 in the regulation of CD8+ T cell function, specifically in the context of chronic viral infections like hepatitis C. The authors find that 2B4 is expressed on a subset of CD8+ T cells in acute and chronic hepatitis C infections, and that high levels of 2B4 expression are associated with impaired CD8+ T cell function. They show that 2B4 cross-linking can either enhance or inhibit CD8+ T cell proliferation depending on the level of 2B4 expression and the availability of intracellular adaptor molecules like SAP. 2B4 cross-linking can also counteract enhanced proliferation induced by PD1 blockade. They suggest that 2B4 may be a potential target for immunotherapy to improve CD8+ T cell function in chronic infections. However, further studies are needed to confirm these findings and explore other costimulatory molecules that regulate CD8+ T cells.
The paper discusses how poxviruses, which are viruses that include smallpox, monkeypox, and cowpox, have strict host-specificity in terms of their ability to infect different species. Many poxviruses have a narrow host range, while a few have a wider range. The authors investigate why mouse SAMD9L, a paralog of human SAMD9, functions as a host restriction factor for poxviruses. They find that mouse SAMD9L is essential for restricting the replication of a poxvirus in mice, while human SAMD9L functions similarly to human SAMD9 as a restriction factor. They also find that mouse SAMD9L has a reduced ability to antagonize poxvirus proteins compared to human SAMD9L. The authors propose that the presence of both SAMD9L and SAMD9 in mammals allows for evolutionary flexibility in evading poxvirus restriction factors, and that the difference in SAMD9L function between species may contribute to the barrier for cross-species poxvirus transmission. They demonstrate this by showing that mouse SAMD9L restricts poxvirus replication in mice, while human SAMD9L restricts poxvirus replication in human cells. They also show that mouse SAMD9L has a reduced ability to antagonize poxvirus proteins compared to human SAMD9L. The results suggest that having both SAMD9L and SAMD9 in mammals may have allowed mammals to more easily evolve to evade poxvirus restriction factors, while the loss of SAMD9L in ruminants may have contributed to the host restriction of poxviruses in non-ruminant hosts.
The paper describes the first comprehensive methylome analysis of two Mycoplasma species, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Mycoplasma genitalium, using single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing. The authors identified two common methylation motifs, 5'-CT-3' and 5'-GAN7TAY-3'-CTR7AT, which were found to be methylated in both species. They found that M. pneumoniae has a Type I methyltransferase (M. pn107) that methylates the 5'-CT-3' motif and M. genitalium has an orthologous methyltransferase (Mg184). M. pneumoniae also has a Type II methyltransferase (M. pn198) that methylates the 5'-GAN7TAY-3'-CT7AT motif. The authors showed that methylation of the 5'-CT-3' motif is involved in regulating DNA replication, as it is only methylated on one strand of the DNA and is not protected by the DNA recognition protein HsdR, unlike E. coli's SeqA. They found that methylation of the 5'-GAN7TAY-3'-CT7AT motif is also involved in regulation, as it is not associated with an associated restriction enzyme. The study found that methylation of promoter regions and 5'-UTRs of transcripts is enriched in genes involved in defense mechanisms and cell division. However, there was no clear correlation between methylation and transcription levels. The study demonstrates the power of SMRT sequencing for analyzing the methylomes of whole microbial genomes, providing new insights into epigenetic control in prokaryotes.
The paper describes how a single mutation in the E protein of West Nile virus (T198F) at position 198, which is conserved among many flaviviruses, increases the sensitivity of the virus to neutralizing antibodies targeting a cryptic epitope in the DII-FL region. This mutation affects the conformational dynamics of the virus and leads to increased accessibility of this epitope. This results in attenuation of West Nile virus infection and pathogenesis in mice, as observed by reduced virion infectivity, decreased viral half-life, and lower infectivity at high antibody concentrations. The authors propose that the conformational flexibility of flaviviruses, which allows them to sample multiple conformations at equilibrium, may play a role in modulating antibody recognition and potency. The increased sensitivity to neutralization by the T198F mutation is not due to increased uncleaved prM retention, but rather due to alterations in the conformational dynamics of the virus. The study highlights the importance of understanding the dynamic properties of flavivirus proteins and their conformational changes in vivo, as it has implications for flavivirus vaccine design and antiviral compound development.
The paper describes the development and validation of a protein microarray-based serodiagnostic test for Burkholderia pseudomallei infection. The test uses 20 protein antigens identified as having potential to detect B. pseudomallei infection based on previous studies. The microarray is constructed with recombinant proteins expressed in E. coli and purified, and spotted on a glass surface at different concentrations. The test is validated using sera and plasma samples from patients at different time points after infection and controls. The results show that the microarray detects B. pseudomallei infection more sensitively and specifically than the standard IHA test, with 13 of the 20 antigens identified by previous studies confirmed as serodiagnostic markers. The microarray also shows that different antigens induce long- and short-term antibody responses, which could be useful for detecting recent vs past infections. The study suggests that the microarray approach has the potential to improve the current diagnostic tools for B. pseudomallei infection, which has a high mortality rate worldwide. However, the test may not be affordable in resource-poor areas and future studies are needed to determine its sensitivity and specificity in different settings.
The paper proposes an optimized Trypanosoma cruzi multi locus sequencing typing (MLST) scheme using 7 target genes that can be used as a gold standard for typing new isolates. The 7 genes are RB19, HMCOAR, RHO1, GPI, SODB, LAP, GPI, PDHAR and  and STPP2. These genes were selected based on their ability to differentiate the 6 known Trypanosoma cruzi discrete transmission units (DTUs) with high bootstrap values, while also providing enough genetic diversity to detect intra-DTU diversity. The authors show that the 7-locus MLST scheme can correctly assign DTUs for the 25 reference strains in the study, while a 4-locus scheme can still provide lineage assignment. The optimized 7-locus MLST scheme provides more robust bootstrap values for phylogenetic analysis and can be used as a basis for typing new isolates. The authors also note that while MLST is a powerful tool, it is not suitable for detecting Trypanosoma cruzi in biological samples due to the sensitivity of the PCR assays and that more sensitive methods are needed. The 7-locus MLST scheme is proposed as a standard for future typing of new isolates.
The paper investigates the function of the gene Doublesex (Dsx) in the disease vector mosquito Aedes aegypti. Doublesex is a gene that regulates sexual differentiation in insects and is known to be involved in sex-specific splicing of mRNAs to produce male and female-specific transcripts. The researchers injected siRNAs targeting Doublesex into mosquito larvae or pupae to study its function in adult females. They found that silencing Doublesex resulted in reduced growth, reproduction, olfactory sensitivity and lifespan in adult females. The study suggests that Doublesex may play a role in regulating the development of the female genitalia and reproductive organs, and that disruption of Doublesex expression could be used as a vector control strategy to reduce the lifespan of female mosquitoes and therefore increase their ability to transmit diseases. The researchers propose that Doublesex regulates expression of genes involved in cell growth and reproduction, and may also have a role in regulating the olfactory system. The study demonstrates the potential for genetic manipulation of Doublesex to control disease vector mosquitoes.
The paper discusses how a protein called LsST6 on the midgut epithelial cells of the planthopper insect L. striatellus mediates the entry of rice stripe virus (RSV) into the insect vector. LsST6 interacts with the nucleocapsid protein of RSV and other viruses transmitted by L. striatellus, colocalizing with RSV particles in the cell membrane of Sf9 cells and midgut epithelial cells. Knocking down the expression of LsST6 in healthy insects resulted in a significant decrease in RSV acquisition and transmission after they fed on RSV-infected rice, indicating that LsST6 plays an important role in facilitating RSV invasion. The fact that LsST6 interacts with the outer capsid of RBSDV and SRBSDV but not RGSV suggests that LsST6 may be specific to the viruses transmitted by L. striatellus. This key vector protein could be used as a target for blocking virus transmission and leading to a new strategy to control outbreaks of diseases caused by arboviruses. The paper provides evidence that LsST6 is essential for RSV invasion of the midgut epithelial cells in its insect vector.
The paper describes an experiment using hamsters to test the efficacy of polyclonal antibodies against homologous and heterologous Leptospira infection. The authors found that polyclonal antibodies derived from rabbits immunized with Leptospira serovar 5601 could protect hamsters against homologous Leptospira serotype 5601 infection, with survival rates significantly higher in the highest dose groups. However, the polyclonal antibodies did not completely protect against heterologous Leptospira serotype 5606 infection. The pathological changes in the kidneys, liver and lungs of infected hamsters were also alleviated in the polyclonal antibody groups. The authors conclude that the IgG-pcAb could be a new option for treating Leptospira infections, but additional clinical research is needed to confirm its efficacy in humans.
The paper describes a study that used single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) typing to analyze Mycobacterium ulcerans isolates from Buruli ulcer patients in Ghana. The researchers developed real-time PCR assays based on 173 SNP loci identified in the reference strain Agy9 and used these assays to type 74 isolates from the Densu river basin area. They found five haplotypes, with haplotype 5 being the most common, and haplotype 10 being found only in one small village. They suggest that the distribution of haplotypes suggests that transmission occurs through focal transmission clusters rather than through direct person-to-person contact, as haplotypes 4 and 7 were only found in certain parts of the basin. They propose that environmental reservoirs such as aquatic invertebrates or insects may play a role in transmission, and suggest that longitudinal studies involving SNP typing of isolates from different areas could provide insight into transmission pathways and reservoirs. The study demonstrates the potential of SNP typing for genetic analysis of this important disease.
This paper discusses the discovery of a quorum sensing mechanism that regulates yeast to hypha transition in Schizosaccharomyces japonicus, a fission yeast species. The authors found that aromatic alcohols, such as phenylethanol, tyrosol, and tryptol, accumulate in the growth medium during stationary phase and high cell density, and inhibit yeast to hypha transition when the initial cell density is above a certain threshold. The stress-activated MAPK signaling pathway (SAPK) negatively regulates the expression of the key transcription factor Atf1, which in turn represses hypha initiation and maintenance. The SAPK pathway is activated by the MAPK Sty1, which phosphorylates Atf1. Nrg1, an activator of hypha transition in S. cerevisiae, is repressed by SAPK in S. japonic. The authors also found that Atf1 partially represses hypha transition in the absence of QSMs, suggesting that Atf1 functions in a transcription-independent manner. The results suggest that SAPK regulates the expression of Nrg1, an activator of hypha transition, and that Atf1 functions as a transcriptional repressor in S. japonic. The QS mechanism is a key regulator of yeast to hypha transition in S. japonic, and the authors propose that the SAPK pathway and Nrg1 function in a cooperative manner to control hypha transition. The study demonstrates that S. japonic is a suitable model organism to explore the mechanisms of cell differentiation in fungi.
The paper discusses the role of interferon omega (IDO) in mediating pain sensitivity during in mice infections with influenza virus (IAV) and murine leukemia virus (MuLV). The authors show that IDO activity in the lungs and splenic dendritic cells of infected mice is sufficient to induce pain sensitivity during both acute and chronic infections. IDO activity in the brain is not necessary for this response. IDO activity in the lungs and splenic dendritic cells leads to increased kynurenine (Kyn) production, which is a neurotransmitter that enhances pain sensitivity via N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. The increased Kyn production in the periphery is thought to enter the CNS and directly or indirectly affect local nerve cells to increase pain sensitivity. The results suggest that elevated IDO activity in peripheral tissues, particularly in dendritic cells, is a common response to in acute and chronic infections and may contribute to the common comorbidities of pain and behavioral disorders associated with many progressive inflammatory diseases. The findings suggest that inhibition of IDO activity may help alleviate heightened pain sensitivity induced as a common comorbidity associated with virus infections.
The paper investigates the role of ecto-nucleotidases in Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent of Chagas disease, in controlling infection and virulence. The authors find that trypanosomes have high levels of ecto-nucleotidase activity, which is important for in maintaining their ability to infect mammalian cells. They show that inhibition of ecto-nucleotidase activity using drugs like Suramin, Gadolinium, and ARL6156 leads to a decrease in in parasite infectivity and virulence in vitro and in vivo. They propose that this is due to the loss of extracellular nucleotide metabolism, which is important for parasite-host interactions. They demonstrate that inhibition of ecto-nucleotidase activity can be achieved using drugs that target the surface-expressed enzyme NTPDase-1, which is expressed at high levels in Y strain trypanosomes. They also show that antibodies against NTPDase-1 can also inhibit parasite infectivity. The results suggest that targeting ecto-nucleotidases could be a new strategy for controlling Chagas disease, using existing drugs like Suramin and Gadolinium as a starting point. However, more research is needed to fully understand the mechanism and develop effective drugs.
The paper describes the development and application of next-generation algorithms for mapping the antibody specificities found in polyclonal responses against HIV-1. The current approach, called NFP, uses a reference set of monoclonal antibodies to estimate the contribution of different antibody specificities to a given polyclonal serum. However, there are limitations to this approach. The new next-generation algorithms: 1) simulate polyclonal neutralization data to generate large amounts of simulated sera, which can be used as a quantitative benchmark for evaluating the performance of NFP algorithms. 2) predict the existence of potentially novel antibody specificities in polyclonal sera that cannot be explained by the reference set of known specificities. 3) incorporate additional confidence measures to determine the accuracy of the predictions. These algorithms were applied to analyze a large collection of HIV-infected donor plasma samples, which showed that the next-generation NFP approach can accurately predict the overall prevalence of different antibody specificities in the samples. The results indicate that there may be a connection between the specificities found in polyclonal responses and the clade of the infection. The authors propose that the ability to analyze large-scale polyclonal responses using NFP could provide valuable insights into the interactions between HIV and the immune system at the population level.
This paper describes a mouse model of Salmonella Typhimurium infection that distinguishes between super-shedders (mice that shed high amounts of bacteria in their feces) and moderate-shedders (mice that shed lower amounts). The researchers found that super-shedders have high levels of neutrophils in their spleen and colonic tissue, but little outward signs of illness, suggesting they tolerate or control the inflammation. In contrast, moderate-shedders have more inflammation and show symptoms. The immune response of super-shedders is characterized by a dampened T cell response, particularly to IL-2, which suppresses the ability of T cells to proliferate. The authors propose that the high levels of neutrophils in the spleen are necessary for the dampened T cell response and for the ability to tolerate the inflammation. They also found that treatment of moderate-shedders with granulocyte-stimulating factor (G-CSF) for 3 days recapitulated the immune phenotype of super-shedders, suggesting that neutrophils are involved in controlling the dampened T cell response. The findings provide a novel mechanism for the establishment of the super-shedder state and may have implications for identifying carriers of Salmonella Typhi in humans.
The paper discusses a genetic mouse model of Lafora disease, a fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in the EPM2 or EPM2B genes encoding laforin (carbohydrate binding phosphatase) and malin (an3 ubiquitin ligase). The disease leads to myoclonus, epilepsy, dementia, and neuronal loss. The mice exhibit polyglucosans and Lafora bodies, which are insoluble glycans that accumulate in neurons. The authors genetically removed the protein PTG, which targets PP1 phosphatase and glycogen metabolizing enzymes, leading to a reduction in glycogen synthesis and polyglucosan formation. They found that this resulted in a reduction in Lafora bodies and neuronal loss, and the elimination of the polyglucosan epilepsy. The results suggest that the neurodegeneration in Lafora disease may be caused by the accumulation of glycogen, rather than the polyglucosans themselves, and that removal of PTG could potentially be a therapeutic approach for the disease. The authors propose that the neuronal loss in Lafora disease may be related to the disturbance of dendritic function and the complete disappearance of dendritic polyglucos in the mice. The reduction in glycogen levels in the mice also normalized the glycogen content, indicating that it was not necessary for polyglucan formation. The results suggest that partial reduction of glycogen synthesis could be a therapeutic approach for Lafora disease and other glycogen storage diseases.
The paper evaluates the association between serological markers (antibodies to Chlamydia trachomatis antigens) and clinical signs of trachoma (follicular inflammation and trachoma infection) in a region where trachoma transmission is around 25% in children aged 0-5 years. The study found that antibody positivity to the antigens was significantly correlated with both clinical trachoma and ocular chlamydia infection at the community level, but not significantly different between study arms. The age-seroprevalence curve of antibody positivity increased with age, indicating that antibody responses represent a pool of exposed individuals rather than currently or recently infected. The study suggests that serological markers may provide complementary information to clinical grading of trachoma and could potentially be used to evaluate trachoma transmission and elimination progress. However, the authors note that the study communities were treated with enhanced antibiotic coverage and thus the antibody responses may not be representative of what would be seen in a previously endemic setting that has achieved elimination thresholds. They argue that laboratory testing, including chlamydia PCR, could be used as a supplement or replacement for clinical grading of trachoma when conducting surveillance after validation, as it provides objective estimates of exposure over time.
This paper discusses how a computational tool called THEMATICS can be used to predict functional residues in proteins of unknown function. The authors apply this tool to a family of structurally similar proteins called the DJ-1 superfamily, which have different biochemical functions despite having similar 3D structures. They use THEMATICS to predict active site residues and spatial arrangements in the structures, which enables them to sort the proteins into functional classes. The predicted active site residues show spatial patterns that allow the different proteins to be grouped into distinct functional categories. The authors find that the predicted active sites for human DJ-1 and YajL are similar and form one group, while the sites for Protease I and PfpI/YbO are different and likely belong to different functional classes. The predicted sites for YDR53Cp and Hsp31 are also different and indicate different functions. The results suggest that despite their similar 3D structures, the six proteins likely belong to at least three different functional classes based on their active site arrangements. The combination of sequence and structural information from THEMATICS and phylogenetic analysis supports the conclusion that the different functional classes exist. The paper shows that predicting binding and recognition sites in proteins with a simple calculation provides important clues for function annotation.
This paper describes how the virus Rice stripe mosa virus (RSV) manipulates the host plant's microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis pathway to promote its own pathogenicity. The study found that RSV encodes a protein called NS3 that can recognize and interact with a key component of the miRNA processing complex called OsDRB1a. NS3 associates with OsDRB1a at specific sites and helps recruit it to pri-miRNAs, promoting their processing. This leads to the accumulation of certain miRNAs that are involved in biotic and abiotic stress response, but also reduces the expression of miRNAs that promote antiviral defense. Overexpression of NS3 in rice plants enhances RSV pathogenicity, while inhibition of NS3 reduces RSV infection. The study shows that NS3 can substitute for the dsRNA binding domain of the OsDRB1a protein in miRNA processing, suggesting that NS3 can recognize pri-miRNAs and recruit them to the miRNA processing complex. This mechanism allows RSV to manipulate the miRNA biogenesis pathway to promote its own pathogenicity, providing new insights into how viruses manipulate host cells.
The paper discusses how naive and memory T cells respond to viral infection in mice. Naive T cells show a 2-4 day delay before dividing after infection, while memory T cells show a similar delay. This delay occurs in both lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues. The delay is observed in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. While memory T cells produce cytokines within hours of infection, they do not initiate division until 2-3 days later. The delay is thought to be due to antigen levels, costimulatory molecules, or negative regulatory factors. The more rapid accumulation of memory T cells is likely due to their higher precursor frequency and improved survival during the early proliferative response. The delay in T cell division may allow the innate response to quickly control the infection before the T cell response escalates. The authors propose that the delay may represent a period of time during which the innate response and effector functions of the memory T cell response are given an opportunity to quickly control the infection. The delayed T cell division may also help diversify the microbe-specific T cell response by preventing the rapid rise of naive T cells that could suppress the memory T cells.
The paper discusses the effect of physiological temperature (39.5°C) on HIV-1 replication in primary CD4+ T cells and Jurkat cells. The study shows that hyperthermia (elevated temperature to 39.5°C) significantly enhances HIV-1 replication in both cell types, with increases ranging from 2 to 7 fold compared to 37°C. Hyperthermia does not significantly alter cell viability, surface protein levels or inflammatory responses. However, hyperthermia does increase Hsp90 levels in cells, which co-localizes with actively transcribing HIV-1 RNA in the nucleus. The study suggests that Hsp90 plays a role in facilitating HIV-1 transcription and replication at 39.5°C, possibly by binding more efficiently to the P-TEFb/Tat/TAR complex and enhancing chromatin accessibility. The findings suggest that fever may directly stimulate HIV replication or reactivation from latent reservoirs, possibly in association with other immunological events. The results provide new insights into the role of temperature in HIV infection and may have implications for understanding HIV disease progression and treatment.
The paper describes the results of an experiment to evaluate the efficacy of two plant extracts, Artemisia annua and Artemisia absinthium, against Leishmania donovani infection in mice. The two plant extracts were found to significantly reduce parasite burden in liver and spleen, with 86-95% reduction at 20g/kg body weight. Only marginal parasite reduction was seen with the chemotherapy drug Arteminininart. The extracts also increased the delayed type hypersensitivity response and proliferation of splenic and lymphocytes, indicating immunological activity. The extracts also increased the expression of co-stimulatory molecules on antigen presenting cells, activated macrophages and upregulated Th1 cytokines like IFN-γ and IL-4. The extracts also increased the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations and CD4/CD8 ratio, indicating a shift towards a Th1 dominated immune response. The results suggest that the plant extracts may be effective antileishmanial agents that can activate immunological responses and shift the balance towards a Th1 dominated immune response, potentially providing a safer alternative to current chemotherapy drugs that can have side effects and resistance.
The paper investigates the role of two proteins, RipA and RpfB, in the cell division of Mycobacterium smegmatis. RipA is found to be essential for normal cell division in M. smegmatis, while RpfB is not. RipA is also essential for resuscitation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in a reactivation model. Depletion of RipA in M. smegmatis leads to long, branched filaments and increased susceptibility to a cell wall targeting antibiotic, suggesting that RipA is involved in the final stage of cell division. The interaction between RipA and RpfB enhances the peptidoglycan hydrolytic activity of RipA, likely by bringing their active sites close enough to cleave bonds near each other in the peptidoglycan. The authors propose that RipA is an attractive target for antimycobacterial drug development due to its accessibility and potential to be inhibited by blocking protein-protein interactions or by blocking enzymatic activity. The study demonstrates that RipA is not redundant in M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis, unlike many other bacterial hydrolytic enzymes, and that its interaction with RpfB may be necessary under certain conditions.
The paper describes a new method called Diffusion Approximations for Demographic Inference that uses a diffusion approach to efficiently infer demographic parameters from joint allele frequency spectra. The diffusion approach models population genetic dynamics, allowing the authors to simulate the joint allele frequency spectrum (AFS) of multiple populations. The authors apply this method to human population genetic data from the Environmental Genome Project to infer demographic parameters for the expansion of humans out of Africa and the settlement of the New World. They find that their models provide a reasonable explanation of the data, though they cannot infer parameters for all populations simultaneously. The diffusion approach is computationally efficient and allows for extensive bootstrapping to estimate variances and test hypotheses, overcoming the limitations of composite likelihood. The diffusion method is able to model linkage and selection effects, which are important for demographic inference. The authors find that their models provide a good explanation of the data, but some parameters are not well constrained due to the limited sample size. The diffusion approach is an efficient tool for demographic inference, though it does not capture all aspects of the data. The authors hope that future studies will improve the method by incorporating additional loci and disentangling selection effects on coding sites.
This paper investigated the genetic basis of human eyebrow thickness, which has been found to vary between populations. The authors conducted a genome-wide association study in East Asian and European populations and found three novel loci associated with eyebrow thickness. They identified two loci near SOX2 and FOXD1 that affect the expression of these genes and thus influence eyebrow thickness. They also found that eyebrow thickness is not associated with strong positive selection, suggesting it may be a neutral trait rather than subject to natural selection. However, eyebrow thickness is significantly related to age and gender, with older individuals having thinner eyebrows and males having thicker eyebrows. The study demonstrates how genome-wide association studies and CRISPR/Cas9 technology can be used together to identify non-coding regulatory variants and validate functional effects. The findings provide insight into the genetic basis of eyebrow thickness and the role of genetic variation in shaping human traits.
The paper compares the sensitivity of Trichuris suis and Oesophagum dentatum, two species of nematode worms that inhabit the same part of the intestine but have different microhabitats, to two anthelmintic drugs, benzimazoles and fenbendazole. The study found that Trichuris suis was less sensitive to both benzimazoles, indicating that it has a lower drug uptake and/metabolism compared to Oesophagum dentatum. The authors suggest that the lower drug concentration in Trichuris suis may be due to its lower cuticle permeability and lipid content compared to Oesophagum dentatum. The study also showed that Trichuris suis is able to metabolize benzimazoles to an inactive form, while Oesophagum dentatum does not. The findings suggest that the lower efficacy of benzimazoles against Trichuris suis infections in humans may be related to its lower drug uptake and metabolism, rather than resistance. The study provides an alternative explanation for the variable efficacy of benzimazoles against Trichuris spp. infections, highlighting the importance of studying the biology of the parasite species and its uptake and metabolism of anthelmintics in understanding treatment strategies.
The paper discusses the impact of nutrient availability on Haemophilus influenzae, a common pathogen that causes middle ear disease. The authors found that when exposed to transiently restricted heme-iron (iron availability), H. influenzae exhibits changes in biofilm architecture that enhance its survival in the middle ear. The biofilms are characterized by tower-like structures, while biofilms exposed to constant heme-iron have a more compact, mat-like architecture. The authors suggest that these changes are due to the fact that the transiently restricted H. influenza populations have a filamentous morphology, which allows them to form the towers. The study demonstrates that changes in heme-iron availability can influence bacterial persistence and disease severity, with transient heme-iron restriction providing a survival advantage in the middle ear. The study provides evidence that heme-iron restriction leads to changes in bacterial morphology, modulates host-pathogen interactions and provides mechanisms for bacterial survival in the face of pro-inflammatory responses. The findings highlight the importance of immune pressure and host microenvironments in shaping bacterial lifestyles and disease progression.
The paper describes the development of the IDODEN ontology for dengue fever, which is based on the IDOMAL vector-borne disease ontology and the GO bio-ontology. The IDOMAL ontology provides a standardized way of describing vector-borne diseases and their vectors, hosts, pathogens and other aspects. The IDODEN ontology aims to provide a similar standardized framework for dengue fever researchers to describe the disease, vectors, hosts, pathogens, diagnosis, and vaccine development. It contains 5035 terms and 1482 imported from other ontologies. It separates the different aspects of dengue into distinct groups: dengue fever, dengue vector, dengue host and dengue virus. It includes terms related to vector control, vector resistance, diagnostic tests, vaccine development and vaccine clinical trials. The authors hope that the ontology will improve data annotation and standardization for dengue research and enable better modeling of complex biological processes. They show examples of how the ontology can be used to model dengue infection, disease progression and epidemiology. The authors also discuss the potential benefits of using ontologies for data analysis and management, and hope that the IDODEN ontology will be useful for the dengue research community.
