The paper describes how epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, play a role in controlling cellular transcriptomes and cellular phenotypes. The authors characterized the epigenetic changes in mouse intestinal adenomas, which are early lesions that can develop into colon cancer. They found that the adenoma-specific DNA methylation patterns are distinct from those found in the major cell types of the intestinal epithelium and arise de novo, rather than coming from a pre-existing cell population. This suggests that the epigenetic changes in tumor cells arise upon transformation rather than being inherited from a minor cell population. They identified a core set of recurring DNA methylation regions that is conserved between mouse adenoma and human colon cancer, which may serve as specific epigenetic disease markers. This core epigenetic signature could be used for early detection of intestinal cancer in humans, potentially allowing for earlier intervention. However, the study also showed that epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes by promoter methylation is a late event that occurs during tumor progression, rather than an early step. Only a subset of genes with promoter methylation are upregulated, while the majority of genes do not follow this simple logic, indicating that changes in promoter methylation do not generally cause altered gene expression. The findings suggest that a two-step model of epigenetic deregulation may be more appropriate, with early instructive mechanisms followed by late stochastic events promoting clonal expansion.
The paper compares how two different strains of the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, Y strain and Col17 strain, isolated from humans, affect the immune response of human monocytes and lymphocytes. They found that infection with the Col17 strain leads to higher expression of activation-related molecules like HLA-DR and TLR-2 on monocytes, and higher expression of cytokines like TNF-alpha and IL-17 on both monocytes and T cells. Infection with the Y strain leads to higher expression of TNF-alpha on monocytes and T cells, but not as high as with Col17. This suggests that infection with Col17 may induce a more balanced immune response, with both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, which could lead to a better outcome. In contrast, infection with the Y strain tends to lead to a more inflammatory response with high levels of TNF-alpha and Granzyme A, which may be associated with pathology. The results suggest that the strain of parasite may play an important role in shaping the host's immune response early on, which could influence disease outcome later on. The findings may be valuable for monitoring the immune response in patients with acute Chagas disease.
The paper describes the results of a series of experiments to determine the function of the DNA polymerase polν (POLν). The researchers created three different mouse models that disrupted the POLν gene, including deleting exon 2, introducing a frameshift mutation in the polymerase domain, and deleting exon 2 and the polymerase domain. They found that POLν is not essential for mouse embryonic development or viability. The POLν-deficient mice had normal lifespan and lacked obvious phenotypes in their testes, suggesting that POLν is specifically involved in testicular development. The POLν gene is highly expressed in testes, particularly in spermatocytes. The POLν polymerase appears to be important for meiotic recombination, particularly at hotspots, but it is not clear if it is involved in DNA repair of DNA double-strand breaks. The researchers found that POLν does not increase sensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, suggesting it is not involved in resistance to crosslinking agents. The paper concludes that the POLν polymerase appears to be specifically involved in testicular development and meiotic recombination.
The paper discusses the potential of using lipidated dengue virus envelope protein domain III (ED III) as a vaccine candidate for dengue fever. Researchers found that lipidating ED III, without the need for exogenous adjuvants, induced stronger antibody responses than the non-lipidated ED III protein. The antibodies elicited by lipidated ED III had higher avidity and neutralizing capacity, suggesting that they would provide more effective immunity against dengue virus infection. The lipidation of ED III also reduced the capacity for antibody-dependent enhancement of infection, which is a potential safety concern for vaccines. The study suggests that lipidated ED III may be a good vaccine candidate, potentially as a booster dose after priming with an attenuated dengue vaccine, to provide long-lasting neutralizing antibody responses with lower risk of adverse effects.
This paper aims to understand why some signaling pathways show little cell-to-cell variability while others show more variability. The researchers build mathematical models of protein kinase cascades, starting with simple gradual models and gradually adding more complex ultrasensitive models. They find that simple gradual models show more cell-to-cell variability than ultrasensitive models, except when robustness requirements are met. Ultrasensitive models can have very steep dose-response curves and behave like a digital switch, while gradual models have gradual dose-response curves. They show that negative feedback can reduce cell-to-cell variability, but only if the feedback loop is upstream in the cascade. Correlated fluctuations in multiple enzyme concentrations are needed to effectively reduce variability in gradual models. The study suggests that cell-to-cell variability can be tuned by adjusting kinetic parameters, gene expression noise, feedback loops, and correlated protein expression. The results help explain why some signaling pathways like the yeast pheromone pathway show little cell-to-cell variability while others exhibit more variability.
This paper discusses the immune response of mice infected with the parasite Leishmania donovani. The researchers found that the immune response of mice infected with the parasite exhibited a biphasic pattern of expansion and contraction, with the first expansion resulting in limited cell division and the second resulting in cell death and exhaustion. They found that the parasite could evade the immune response by limiting the expansion and inducing exhaustion of CD8+ T cells. They also found that blocking the inhibitory receptor B7-H1 on dendritic cells helped restore some of the lost CD8+ T cell function. They conclude that restoration of dysfunctional CD8+ T cell responses induced by chronic L. donovani infections results in disease control and host protection, and could provide insights into the development of novel strategies for therapeutic vaccination or interventions aimed at inducing CD8+ T cell responses.
The paper discusses the misfolding of the protein PrP, which is linked to transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. While little is known about the underlying mechanism, the authors focus on the region of the protein that undergoes deep refolding during the conversion. They use molecular dynamics simulations to study the effect of protonating one buried residue, H187, at pH 4.5, which corresponds to the lowest pH observed in endosomes. They find that protonating H187 leads to electrostatic repulsion between the positive charges of H187 and R136, a nearby charged residue, and the structure reorganizes. The simulation results show that protonating H187 leads to the unraveling of the helix H2(Cter) and elongation of the S1,S2, in either one of two routes. This dual behavior may reconcile different observations and proposals regarding the actual region of the protein that undergoes deep refolding. The authors suggest that molecular chaperones in vivo could favor one of the two routes, leading to different strains of PrP. The ability of PrP to exhibit multiple strains may explain its susceptibility to transmissible spongiform encephalopathies.
The paper discusses a study on the management of minor trichiasis (a condition where eyelashes turn inwards and touch the eye) in a trachoma-endemic area in Ethiopia. The study found that while surgery is the recommended treatment, only about a third of people with minor trichias who were offered free surgery accepted it, with the majority preferring to continue epilation (forced plucking of lashes) as an alternative. The study found that epilation was effective in controlling trichias, with only a few showing signs of significant progression. However, surgery was more effective in controlling trichias and corneal opacity. Despite this, only about 10% of people with minor trichias accepted surgery. The study suggests that good quality epilation, with regular follow-up and the option of surgery if needed, is a reasonable alternative to surgery for those who decline or do not have access to surgery. This could help manage the large number of people with minor trichias, particularly those with mild disease, and reduce the burden of blindness in trachoma-endemic areas.
This paper investigates a new receptor, the mannose receptor (MR), that has been identified as a potential entry receptor for the dengue virus (DV) in human monocytes/macrophages. The authors show that the MR can bind to the DV envelope protein in a lectin-like manner and this binding is sufficient to confer DV infection of transfected cells. They also demonstrate that IL-4 and IL-3 cytokines increase the susceptibility of monocytes/macrophages to DV infection, suggesting a Th2 environment. The study expands on previous work showing that the DC-SIGN receptor is important for DV attachment, but not internalization. The MR may play a role in both attachment and internalization. The authors propose that the MR may be a new entry receptor for DV infection of human monocytes/macrophages and that its constitutive recycling to the cell surface and ability to internalize via endocytosis and phagocytosis make it a promising candidate. Further studies are needed to determine the exact role of the MR in DV infection.
The paper explores the role of homeostatic mechanisms in regulating neural activity and behavior in a simple neural network model of a virtual agent interacting with a virtual environment. The model has two types of homeostatic mechanisms: local homeostatic plasticity at each node to balance excitatory input, and macroscopic homeostatic balancing across nodes to maintain a constant activity level. The local homeostatic plasticity helps the agent escape traps caused by sensory input, but the agent remains stationary in low-sensory areas. The macroscopic homeostatic balancing helps compensate for changes in activity caused by sensory input and movement, allowing more exploratory behavior. The combined local and macroscopic homeostatic mechanisms work together to achieve a more stable behavior, with more complex activity patterns and movement trajectories. The results suggest that homeostatic mechanisms may help regulate neural dynamics in real brains, particularly in the context of sensory-motor interactions and exploratory behavior, and could potentially explain the function of the default mode network. While the model is simple, the findings provide insights into the roles of task-negative networks in the brain and their relationship to sensory-motor processing and cognitive control.
This paper explores the role of long-distance chromosomal interactions in gene regulation in yeast. The authors constructed a yeast insertion library with over 2000 haploid strains each containing a variable gene locus, then inserted a GFP reporter flanked by a variable number of kilobases upstream of the gene of interest. They found that 30 out of the 137 strains showed unusual expression patterns, with some showing high expression and high noise. They investigated the mechanisms behind this and found that the high expression in some strains was due to Sir2-mediated silencing, transcriptional interference, and clustering of Met4-targeted genes. They showed that the overexpression in some strains was specific to the MET3pr promoter, which tended to locate near Met4-targeted genes. When the MET3pr was moved to a different locus, the overexpression and interactions with other profile 4 loci were lost. These results suggest that a subset of Met4-targeted genes cluster together in the nucleus, which leads to enhanced gene expression through a sub-nuclear compartment with higher concentrations of transcription factors and polymerases. The clustering may be mediated by chromosome folding or DNA-binding proteins, but the exact mechanism is unclear. The study demonstrates that long-distance chromosomal interactions can affect gene expression in a specific and targeted way, which could be useful for engineering gene expression noise.
The paper describes how the protein Pch2 plays a critical role in ensuring proper chromosome segregation during meiosis by controlling the number and positioning of COs. The authors found that Pch2 localizes to CO-designated sites during meiosis and affects the number of Zip3 foci along chromosomes. They showed that Pch2 is required for timely CO formation but CO levels remain normal in a pch2 mutant. However, Pch2 is defective in ensuring normal spore viability when DSBs are reduced. The results suggest that Pch2 reorganizes chromosome axes into modules of assured CO formation, called One Crossover Modules (OCMs), which control CO placement and interference. Each OCM has a centrally localized Zip3 focus with associated Hop1 hyperabundance domain extending to both sides, and Pch2 mediates CO designation and interference. Pch2 is proposed to function as a determinant for OCM installation. The stress hypothesis of CO control provides a mechanistic explanation of how chiasma assurance/maturation and interference might be linked along each OCM. The OCMs constitute independent stress modules that mediate crossover designation and interference. The findings provide insights into how chromosome axes undergo programmed changes in their global structure during meiosis, and how CO levels are controlled in different organisms.
This paper describes the identification and characterization of the Arabidopsis protein RIN4, which is a negative regulator of plant innate immunity. RIN4 interacts with PM H+ATPases AHA1 and AHA2 to regulate stomatal apertures in response to pathogen attack. RIN4 overexpression leads to enhanced H+ATPase activity, while the knockout of RIN4 leads to decreased H+ATPase activity, indicating that RIN4 plays a role in plant immunity. The authors show that RIN4 is expressed in guard cells and that AHA1 and AHA2 are also expressed in guard cells, and interact with RIN4. They demonstrate that RIN4 is a positive regulator of H+ATPase activity. They also show that the RIN4 knockout line does not reopen its stomata after pathogen inoculation, indicating that RIN4 is required for plant immunity. They propose a model in which RIN4 interacts with AHA1 and AHA2 to regulate stomatal apertures, and that this interaction is important for plant immunity. The study provides insights into how plant immunity mechanisms can be regulated by protein complexes and how plant immunity signals may be conserved across different cell types and species.
The paper discusses how routine larviciding against mosquitoes can be used to prevent outbreaks of diseases like dengue and chikungunya in European municipalities with temperate climates. The researchers used data from two seasons of mosquito trapping in Italy to develop a mathematical model of mosquito population dynamics and transmission risk. They found that larviciding is most effective when targeting breeding sites during the month of highest mosquito abundance, July, and that more intensive larviciding efforts are only beneficial in areas with high transmission risk. The cost-effectiveness of larviciding depends on the actual mosquito abundance in the current year, with smaller towns benefiting from more intensive efforts and larger cities requiring targeted larviciding of specific areas. The researchers also found that involving citizens in treating breeding sites can sometimes be cost-effective in smaller towns. The paper concludes that larviciding has the potential to reduce transmission risks, but additional strategies like source reduction and genetic modification of mosquitoes may be needed to achieve complete elimination. The results provide guidance for European municipalities with temperate climates on planning and timing larviciding interventions to prevent or reduce epidemiological risks.
The paper proposes a new approach for how echolocating bats navigate through complex environments. The authors argue that bats use a simple sensorimotor system that focuses on the first millisecond of the echoes and relies on the time delay and interaural intensity differences between the echoes to navigate obstacles. They simulate this system and show that it can successfully avoid obstacles even when faced with many overlapping echoes, unlike previous approaches that require reconstructing the 3D layout of the environment. They propose that this simple system is robust and can handle complex environments, while traditional approaches that reconstruct the 3D layout would be less effective. They suggest that this behavior-based control system, which focuses on specific cues for specific behaviors, could be a good fit for bats' echolocation abilities, as their sensory environment is too complex and noisy to support reconstructing a complete 3D model. This behavior-based approach could provide a more robust and efficient way for bats to navigate through complex environments, while allowing them to exploit multiple cues for different behaviors.
The paper explores the potential for fundamental principles underlying the evolution of metabolic networks. The authors develop an idealized chemistry model with simple molecules and reactions and search for minimal pathways that can perform specific metabolic tasks with minimal inputs and outputs. They find that the minimal pathways have properties that resemble those found in real metabolic networks, including a preference for certain reactions and metabolites of a certain length. They also find that the properties of the minimal pathways in the idealized model match the statistics of reaction usage in real metabolic pathways, suggesting that similar principles may have shaped the architecture of real metabolic networks. They conclude that a logarithmic strategy of minimal pathways may have played a role in the evolution of metabolism, and that identifying these principles could guide the optimization of metabolic pathways in synthetic biology.
The paper describes a new method called MAPS (Migration And Population-size Surfaces) to infer the migration rates and population sizes of populations across space and time. The method uses pairwise shared segments of coalescent events (PSC segments) between genotype data to estimate the migration rates and population sizes. The PSC segments are defined as genomic segments with a single coalescent time across their length. By analyzing different length bins of PSC segments, the method can reveal different migration patterns and population sizes associated with different time periods. The method builds upon a stepping-stone model where demes are connected by migration rates and population sizes. The method uses Bayesian inference to estimate the parameters of the model. The authors test the method with simulations and apply it to a real genotype dataset of European individuals to infer population sizes and dispersal patterns. The results show that the method can reveal interesting patterns of population structure across space and time, although the estimates of population sizes are not exact due to limitations in the model and data.
The paper discusses how insulin resistance in the liver affects the liver's ability to repair itself after injury. Insulin resistance has been linked to liver disease and cancer, but the exact mechanisms are not well understood. The study found that mice lacking a protein called IRS2, which couples insulin receptors to intracellular signaling pathways, had impaired liver repair after injury. Specifically, IRS2 was needed for the liver to produce growth factors that promote epithelial repair and reduce fibrosis. Loss of IRS2 resulted in reduced expression of a protein called Fgf7 on fibroblasts, which promotes epithelial repair. IRS2 also protected fibroblasts from death after injury. Coculture experiments showed that IRS2 in fibroblasts promoted expression of a protein called Fgfr2, which promotes epithelial differentiation. The findings suggest that insulin resistance may impair liver repair by reducing paracrine signaling between fibroblasts and epithelial cells, leading to reduced epithelial repair and increased fibrosis. The study provides a model for how insulin resistance may contribute to liver disease and metabolic disorders.
The paper discusses how a protein called IRE-1 plays a key role in controlling the development and patterning of neuronal dendrites. Dendrites are complex branching structures found on neurons that receive signals from other neurons. The authors found that IRE-1, a protein involved in the unfolded protein response pathway, is required for proper development and patterning of dendrites in both the nematode worm C. elegans and rat neurons. In C. elegans, mutations in the IRE-1 gene cause dendrite defects, such as reduced branching and mislocalization of a protein called DMA-1. The authors found that reducing insulin signaling, which activates a different branch of the unfolded protein response pathway, can bypass these defects and restore proper dendrite patterning. These findings suggest that promoting ER homeostasis through reducing insulin signaling may be a potential approach to treat neurodegenerative diseases that involve dendrite defects.
The paper describes a study on the ArcAB two-component system in Escherichia coli, which is involved in maintaining the balance between oxidation and reduction of NADH/NAD+ during anaerobic glucose fermentation. The ArcAB system is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of genes involved in carbon metabolism and energy production. The authors used ChIP-seq and ChIP-chip to map the binding sites of the ArcA transcription factor to the E. coli genome and identified 176 binding regions. They found that the binding sites contain multiple direct repeats of 1-8 bp, which is a common motif that consists of two direct repeats separated by 1-2 bp. The binding sites were found to have varying numbers and spacings of direct repeats, indicating plasticity in the ArcAB architecture. The authors also found that the binding sites influence the expression of nearby operons and affect the concentration of transcription factors. They showed that ArcA directly regulates the expression of nearly 10 operons and is primarily a repressor of genes involved in carbon metabolism. The ArcAB system is found to maintain the NADH/NAD+ balance during anaerobic glucose fermentation by repressing genes involved in carbon oxidation pathways. The authors propose that the plasticity in the ArcAB binding sites allows for diverse transcriptional outputs, which may help optimize carbon metabolism under different conditions. The study provides new insights into the mechanism of ArcAB regulation and its role in maintaining redox balance.
This paper describes the discovery of a gene called usp39 that regulates cell growth and proliferation in the developing pituitary gland. The authors identified a mutation in the usp39 gene in zebrafish embryos that led to microcephaly and smaller eyes, as well as pituitary abnormalities. They found that loss of usp39 resulted in increased expression of a gene called rb1, which is involved in cell cycle regulation. The usp39 mutation also led to downregulation of another gene called e2f4, which is also involved in cell cycle regulation. The authors showed that the increase in e2f4 expression was responsible for the pituitary abnormalities seen in usp39 mutants, and that overexpression of e2f4 in usp39 mutants led to increased cell proliferation. They propose that usp39 regulates cell growth and proliferation by modulating the splicing of the rb1 gene through its role in the Rb1/E2F4 pathway. This mechanism may have implications for understanding how the pituitary develops and how pituitary tumors form.
The paper discusses how infections in newborn infants, particularly intrauterine infections like congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV), can cause developmental abnormalities in the brain and result in long-term neurological problems. The authors developed a mouse model of CMV infection in newborn mice to study the mechanisms of disease. They found that inflammation in the brain, rather than direct viral damage, was the main cause of developmental abnormalities in the mice. The authors treated newborn mice with corticosteroids to limit inflammation and found that this reduced the inflammation and normalized developmental abnormalities in the brain, suggesting that inflammation in the brain was the main cause of the problems. The results suggest that modulating inflammation in the brain may be a potential approach to limit developmental abnormalities in infected newborns. However, the study has limitations as it only models CMV infection in newborn mice and the results may not directly apply to human disease.
This paper discusses the potential of using autotransporter proteins as vaccine candidates for Escherichia coli (E. coli) infections. The authors found that conserved autotransporter proteins expressed on the surface of E. coli strains are recognized by the immune system during both experimental and natural infections in mice and humans. They identified two conserved autotransporter proteins, Ag43 and pAT, which were found in multiple E. coli strains and were recognized by antibodies during in mice and human infections. They tested the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of these proteins as vaccine candidates in mice and found that immunization with either of them resulted in increased antibody levels and protection against E. coli colonization. While the proteins themselves do not appear to contribute directly to E. coli pathogenesis, they may be recognized by the immune system during in response to infection and could serve as useful antigens for vaccine development. The plasticity of E. coli genomes has historically made it difficult to identify conserved, pathogen-specific antigens, but the authors suggest that autotransporter proteins may be a promising target for vaccine development.
The paper describes the clinical, epidemiological and virological features of Crimean-Congo hemoragic fever (CCHF) cases in Oman over the past 20 years. The authors analyzed data from 8 confirmed CCHF cases in Oman between 195 and 2017, including demographics, risk factors, symptoms, laboratory values and outcomes. They found that the majority of cases were male, occurred in the summer months around the Eid Alha festival, and were associated with exposure to animals and fresh tissue. The viral sequences from the cases were similar to those from other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, indicating that CCHF has been endemic in the region for at least 20 years. They suggest that under-diagnosis and lack of awareness about CCHF among the public and healthcare providers may be contributing to the high mortality rate, which was 36.4%. The paper highlights the need for prospective studies to determine how often milder cases of CCHF occur in Oman and neighboring countries.
This paper discusses how cellular robustness against gene overexpression can be measured and analyzed through an experiment called "genetic tug-of-war" (gTOW). The gTOW involves overexpressing a target gene and measuring how much of its inhibitor is needed to cause cell death. By comparing this copy number limit to the gene's native expression level, the robustness of the cell against gene overexpression can be determined. The paper then uses this information to analyze the mechanism by which the cell maintains robustness against gene overexpression. The authors find that dosage imbalance between the gene and its inhibitor is the main cause of cellular fragility, and propose that this is masked by other regulatory factors in the cell. They suggest that knowing the mechanisms underlying cellular robustness can improve mathematical models and help identify potential drug targets. The authors demonstrate this by analyzing the gene CDC14 and ESP1 and finding that dosage imbalance between them causes cellular fragility, while additional regulations by CDH1 and CLB2 mask this effect. They propose that dosage balance is a common cause of cellular fragility, and that modifying regulators around this balance can control cellular robustness. The study shows how experiments like gTOW can be used to evaluate and refine mathematical models and improve integrative cellular models.
The paper discusses a new mechanism for the pathogenesis of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) infection. KSHV, a gamma-herpesvirus, induces the degradation of a transcription factor called STAT6 during the lytic cycle, which is required for the reactivation of the virus from latency. STAT6 is degraded through both the proteasome and lysosomal pathway. This degradation leads to increased expression of a protein called TRIML2, which in turn enhances expression of the RTA (a transcriptional activator of KSHV genes) and viral production. The degradation of STAT6 and TRIML2 is cell-type independent and occurs during the lytic cycles of all human herpesviruses studied. The study suggests that the degradation of STAT6 is a key event in the reactivation of the KSHV life cycle, and the interaction between STAT6 and RTA is involved in the degradation. The study also shows that the degradation of STAT6 is required for cell survival during the lytic cycle.
This paper presents the results of a study on dengue fever infection in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The researchers conducted a prospective cohort study where they collected blood samples from 125 people before and 60 people after the monsoon season in 2012. They found that 80% of the initial participants had dengue antibodies, and 222% of the participants had IgM antibodies indicating recent infection. The antibody prevalence increased with age, with children under 12 having a higher prevalence than adults. The study found that factors like indoor plants, mosquito control measures and attending public gatherings were associated with dengue seroconversion. Household level factors like indoor plants and mosquito control measures were found to be significantly associated with seroprevalence. The study suggests that the high prevalence of dengue in Dhaka indicates that there is likely a significant under-recognized burden of mild and severe dengue cases in the population. The researchers recommend that household level interventions like removing indoor plants and increasing bed net use in addition to vector control measures in public parks could help reduce exposure. However, they note that without an active surveillance system and effective public health measures, understanding and preventing dengue spread remains poor.
The paper discusses how the bacterium Clostridium difficile sporulates, or forms spores. The spores are important for the bacteria's ability to survive adverse conditions and infect hosts. The sporulation process involves the expression of a gene called σK, which is controlled by a series of genes that are expressed in different compartments and at different times during sporulation. The gene σK requires the excision of a skinCd element, which is encoded by a gene called CD134. The paper shows that excision of CD134 is necessary for σK activity, but CD131, the gene that encodes the CD134 protein, is not restricted to the mother cell. CD134 can stimulate CD131 activity. The paper concludes that excision of CD134 restricts CD131 activity, but inactivation of CD134 does not affect sporulation as much as mutation of σK or CD131. The paper also discusses how CD134 acts as a recombination direction factor that helps CD131 perform excision of the skinCd element. The paper suggests that the premature activity of σK during sporulation may lead to alterations in the spore surface layers, which could affect the spore's ability to persist and infect.
This paper describes a systematic analysis of how well machine learning algorithms can predict diseases from human microbiome shotgun metagenomic data. The authors analyzed 242 human shotgun metagenomic samples from 8 studies to predict liver cirrhosis, colorectal cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, type 2 diabetes and other diseases using 4 different machine learning algorithms. They found that while cross-validation within the same study worked well, cross-validation across studies and cross-disease prediction generally showed better results. The most predictive features were strain-specific markers, not just species abundance. They also found that including healthy samples from other studies improved the accuracy of predictions for diseased samples, especially for type 2 diabetes. They also showed that including samples from independent studies could be useful for predicting diseases for which no training samples were available. Overall, the results suggest that machine learning from metagenomic data can be useful for predicting some diseases, but care must be taken to avoid overfitting and confounding factors.
The paper investigated the relationship between the rate of HIV-1 evolution and the risk of disease progression in subjects carrying the HLA-B*501 allele. The study found that subjects with higher CD4+ T cell counts in early infection had slower viral evolution, as indicated by lower synonymous substitution rates. This suggests that maintaining a strong immune system during early infection may help control HIV-1 replication and reduce the risk of progression to AIDS. The analysis found that subjects with lower CD4+ T cell counts at baseline had higher synonymous substitution rates, indicating faster viral evolution and higher risk of progression to AIDS. The study provides a possible evolutionary mechanism for the different risk of disease progression in HLA-B*501 subjects, indicating that subjects who maintain CD4+ T cell counts above 70 cells/mm3 in early infection are more likely to control HIV-1 replication and have slower evolution. The results suggest that synonymous substitution rates, which are proportional to in vivo replication rates, could be used as a novel evolutionary marker of disease progression.
The paper describes how the researchers identified a protein called TbMCP14 as a key target for choline analogs that are used to treat African trypanosomiasis. They used a genetic screen to identify genes that conferred resistance to these drugs and found that TbMCP14 was one of the genes that was down-regulated when the parasites were exposed to the drugs. When they over-expressed TbMCP14 in the parasites, they found that the parasites became more sensitive to the drugs, indicating that TbMCP14 was involved in the action of the drugs. They also showed that TbMCP14 is involved in proline metabolism and energy production in the parasites. The researchers generated TbMCP14 knockout parasites and found that these parasites had reduced growth rates, which was dependent on the availability of glucose as an energy source. They also showed that depletion of TbMCP14 reduced proline-dependent ATP production in the parasites, suggesting that TbMCP14 is involved in proline transport. The results suggest that TbMCP14 is an important target for drugs that act on the mitochondria of the parasites and may be involved in the mechanism of action of choline analogs.
The paper discusses the evolutionary history and functional differences of a type of G protein-coupled receptor called bombesin receptor (BRS3) between placental mammals and non-placental vertebrates. BRS3 was previously considered an orphan receptor because it did not have a known endogenous ligand. However, the authors found that BRS3 in placental mammals has lost its ability to bind the original ligands GRP and NMB, and instead becomes constitutively active, activating Gq and G1 signaling pathways. They identified specific residues in the N-terminal domain of BRS3 that are responsible for this loss of ligand binding and constitutive activity. These residues underwent positive selection in placental mammals, leading to the conclusion that BRS3 in placental mammals is now a genuinely orphan receptor, constitutively activated by Gq signaling rather than a ligand binding. The study suggests that some orphan receptors may never be deorphanized and may remain constitutively active in a ligand-independent manner.
The paper proposes a framework called SPINDLE that can automatically score animal EEG and EMG recordings from sleep experiments. The framework uses convolutional neural networks to learn robust features that generalize across different animals and experiments, and a hidden Markov model to describe the dynamics of vigilance state transitions. The CNN is trained to predict the vigilance state of the brain based on the EEG and EMG signals, while the Markov model helps to suppress impossible transitions. The framework is trained on wildtype animals and then tested on other animals from different labs and species. The results show that SPINDLE achieves performance comparable to human experts, with high agreement rates between the automatic and manual scoring. The framework also has the ability to detect artifacts and outperforms existing methods. The authors argue that the CNN and Markov model help to learn robust features and describe the dynamics of sleep patterns, allowing for improved performance. The framework is available as a web service for researchers to easily evaluate animal EEG/EMG recordings.
The paper describes how the intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii, which causes toxoplasmosis, can import isoprenoids from its host cells to support its growth and survival, but it also has a backup plan to produce its own isoprenoids when needed. The authors found that the parasite can import isoprenoids from the host, particularly the host's mevalonate pathway, when it is in a stressful environment or when it is outside the host. They created a mutant that lacked an enzyme needed for producing its own isoprenoids and found that it had a defect in energy generation and growth in macrophages. This suggests that the parasite relies on importing isoprenoids from the host to survive outside the host. The authors propose a strategy of combining drugs that target the parasite's own isoprenoid pathway with drugs that target the host's mevalonate pathway to in order to treat Toxoplasmosis. They showed that this strategy works in vitro and in mice, with the combination of zoledronic acid and atorvastatin showing synergy. They suggest that this approach could be useful for treating other intracellular parasites that also rely on importing host isoprenoids.
The paper describes a comparative genomics study of three fungal pathogens that cause the Sigatoka disease on bananas and plantains. The three pathogens, Pseudoceros musae, Pseudoceros eumae, and Pseudoceros fiji, have different levels of virulence and were found to have different genetic adaptations. The study found that genome size, gene content, gene family composition and gene duplication were different among the three pathogens. The three pathogens have different types and numbers of transposable elements and insertions, which may have contributed to their different virulence. The study identified genes and proteins that are specific to each species, and found that the more virulent species have evolved mechanisms for exploiting plant nutrients. The study also identified genes that encode for effectors and secreted proteins that are species-specific. The study suggests that the evolution of virulence in the pathogens has been driven by both species-specific adaptations and convergence of genetic changes in genes involved in metabolism and nutrient acquisition. The study provides insights into how fungal pathogens evolve virulence and how this can be targeted for disease management.
This paper describes an attempt to identify distinct gene expression signatures in human whole blood from distinct states of infection with Leishmania infantum, including asymptomatic infection, visceral leishmaniasis and patients undergoing treatment. The study found that infections with L. infantum induce significant changes in the abundance of blood transcripts that depend on the clinical status after infection or activity of the disease. Asymptomatic individuals exhibited a strong type I interferon signature, while patients undergoing treatment showed positive regulation of gene modules related to TCR signaling and antigen presentation, while patients with visceral leishmaniasis showed negative regulation of innate immune pathways. The results suggest that treatment may induce activation of pathways such as Notch signaling and up-regulation of B lymphocyte populations. The study also found that the downregulation of innate immune pathways in visceral leishmaniasis patients may be due to decreased proportions of circulating myeloid cells. The findings suggest that proper antigen presentation and differentiation of CD4+ T cells may be disrupted during visceral leishmaniasis, leading to exhausted CD8+ T cell responses and parasite evasion. Overall, the study highlights that infections with L. infantum elicit coordinated activity of multiple biological processes rather than perturbations in a particular immune compartment.
The paper describes a mathematical model that explains how seemingly complex social behavior in the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum can be generated by a relatively simple mechanism based on the production and response to social signals. The authors find that differences in signal production and sensitivity between genotypes can lead to facultative changes in social behavior, which were previously thought to require recognition mechanisms. They show that apparent facultative changes in behavior can be predicted from measurements of signal production and response, and do not necessarily imply changes in underlying genotype. This suggests that the underlying mechanisms of social behavior are more complex but can be simplified into a set of parameters related to signal production and response. This has implications for understanding the evolution and maintenance of social behavior, as defining basic rules governing interactions may help identify genes and pathways that underlie social behavior. The authors find that apparent facultative changes can be generated by a single gene mutation that affects signal production and sensitivity, demonstrating that pleiotropic effects are negative and likely the result of biological constraints. The findings provide a solution to the problem of how complex social behavior can arise from simple rules.
The paper describes the discovery of a new motif called the secretion-enhancing cis-regulatory targeting element (SECReTE) that is found in the RNA sequences of secretory proteins. SECReTE is characterized by the presence of at least 10 consecutive pyrimidine residues in the coding sequence, particularly in the second and third codon positions. The authors found that SECReTE is more abundant in secretory proteins compared to non-secretory proteins and is positioned differently in different organisms. They experimentally verified that SECReTE is associated with the translation-dependent mechanism of secretion and enhances secretion of proteins by increasing mRNA localization to the endoplasmic reticulum, translation efficiency, and secretion. They identified binding partners for SECReTE called secretion-dependent proteins-binding proteins (SBPs) and found that SECReTE binding to these proteins is important for secretion. The study suggests that SECReTE may play a role in targeting secretory proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum, rather than just the signal peptide sequence. The results provide evidence that mRNA localization to the endoplasmic reticulum is an important mechanism for secretion and translation, and that mRNA sequence motifs like SECReTE may play a role in this process.
The paper discusses the genetic analysis of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in California. The researchers found that there are two distinct genetic clusters in California populations: one from Northern California and one from Southern California. They suggest that the Northern California populations likely originated from the South Central region of the US, while the Southern California populations likely came from the Southwest region. They found evidence of overwintering in Northern California, but not in Southern California. The Southern California populations have lower genetic diversity and allelic richness, which may be due to a bottleneck caused by vector control or founder effects. The researchers conclude that multiple introductions of Aedes aegypti occurred in California, likely years before the first detection in 2013. This has implications for vector control and the vulnerability of regions with temperate climates to mosquito invasions. They suggest that the genetic distinctness of populations in California may mean that different populations respond differently to control measures and have different vector competence for infectious pathogens. The paper highlights the need for continued monitoring and understanding of mosquito invasion dynamics to prevent disease outbreaks.
The paper describes the genetic analysis of the bacteria Rhodoccus opacus PD630 and Rhodoccus jostii RHA1, two species of Actinomycetales that can ferment organic compounds into lipids. The authors used whole genome sequencing and bioinformatics to identify genes involved in lipid biosynthesis and metabolism. They found that Rhodoccus species have a unique set of genes for storing lipids that allows them to ferment a wide range of organic compounds as a sole carbon source. They identified genes involved in the synthesis of straight-chain odd-carbon lipids, which were previously thought to be methyl-branched, but their analysis showed that they are actually straight-chain. The genes involved in this process were found to be conserved across Actinycetes, indicating that genes for lipid biosynthesis have evolved in a similar way across related species. The study provides a genetic model for understanding the metabolism of Rhodoccus, which could be used to engineer Rhodoccus to produce lipids for biofuels.
The paper explores how prokaryotic DNA can be considered as a set of differently sized oligonucleotides and how examining these oligonucleotide frequencies can reveal properties of the genome. The authors found that tetranucleotide frequencies carried the most information potential and were therefore used in all statistical tests. They found that:   - Tetranucleotide variance within genomes was correlated with genomic GC content, indicating that more GC-rich genomes had less varied tetranucleotide frequencies.  - AT-rich genomes had more varied tetranucleotide frequencies than GC-rich genomes. - Tetranucleotide variance within coding regions was more strongly correlated with global GC content than tetranucleotide variance in non-coding regions. - Non-coding regions had less varied tetranucle frequencies than coding regions. - Oligonucleotide sizes larger than hexanucleotides had little additional information potential. - The variance in tetranucleotide frequencies within genomes was negatively correlated with genomic GC content.   In summary, the authors found that genomic GC content was a major factor in determining the variance in tetranucleotide frequencies and that coding regions had less varied tetranucle frequencies than non-coding regions. This suggests that non-coding regions carry more information and are more exposed to selectional pressures.
This paper describes an analysis of the effects of targeted gene knockout and gene deletion in mice using RNA sequencing. The researchers found that targeted gene knockout resulted in local effects on genes flanking the targeted gene, with more downregulation than expected. They found that 59% of gene knockouts resulted in downregulation within 50 kb of the target gene compared to 7% of gene deletions. They also found that 7% of gene knockouts resulted in upregulation within 50b of the target gene compared to 1% of deletions. The local effects were more common for gene deletions. The researchers hypothesize that the local effects are due to the targeting event disrupting regulatory elements within the targeted gene and the exogenous promoter in the selection cassette, and insertion of vector DNA. They suggest that some local effects may be compensatory changes, but the frequency of local effects around gene deletions was higher than expected. The paper concludes that local gene expression changes may affect phenotypes in targeted mutants.
This paper investigated the mechanism by which a gene called Dmrt1 is regulated in the development of the gonads (reproductive organs) of fish. Dmrt1 is important for determining the sex of the embryo and for maintaining the gonads. The researchers found that a specific sequence in the Dmrt1 mRNA called the D3U-box is targeted by two proteins called Ol-cug-bp and Ol-bsf, which control whether the mRNA is degraded or stabilized. The D3U-box sequence is conserved in many species, including humans, suggesting that the mechanism is evolutionarily old. The researchers showed that Ol-cug-bp and Ol-bsf target the D3U-box in a way that stabilizes the mRNA, leading to increased expression of Dmrt1 and other genes in gonad cells. They also showed that the expression of Ol-bsf in gonad cells is restricted to specific subpopulations of cells, suggesting a new function in germ cell biology. Overall, the study reveals a new mechanism of mRNA regulation that is conserved across many species and highlights the importance of post-transcriptional regulation in determining the sex of the embryo and the development of the gonads.
The paper investigated the relationship between eggshell melanization and egg resistance to desiccation in three mosquito species: Aedes aegypti, Anopheles aquasalis, and Culex quinquefasciatus. They found that eggs of Ae. aegypti, which have high resistance to desiccation, exhibit high levels of eggshell melanization. Eggs of Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus, which have lower resistance, exhibit less melanization. They conclude that eggshell melanization is associated with egg viability outside the water after serosal cuticle formation. They suggest that eggshell melanization is one of the traits that allows Ae. aegypti to keep its eggs viable for longer outside the water, which is important for the transmission of diseases. They propose that other factors beyond eggshell melanization contribute to the differential resistance to desiccation among the three mosquito species, including differences in egg size, weight, surface area, and endochorion thickness. They argue that understanding the relationship between eggshell melanization and desiccation resistance is important for studies of mosquito ecology and evolution.
The paper discusses how schistosomiasis, a parasitic infection common in sub-Saharan Africa, may increase the likelihood of people becoming infected with HIV through the mucosal route, which is the most common way HIV is transmitted. The researchers tested this hypothesis by exposing schistosome-infected and non-infected rhesus macaques to a low dose of a simian-HIV virus and measuring the infectious dose needed to cause systemic infection. They found that the infectious dose was much lower in the schistosome-infected macaques, indicating that the schistosome infection made them more susceptible to HIV infection. This susceptibility was seen in both the peak viral load and the number of CD4+ T cells that were infected. The researchers suggest that the increased susceptibility may be due to a shift to a Th2-type immune response, which is associated with increased viral replication within immune cells. The study provides evidence that controlling helminth infections may be an effective public health intervention to reduce the risk of HIV transmission in areas where both parasites and HIV are common.
This paper investigates how developmental reproducibility is maintained in embryos despite stochastic gene expression. The authors find that stepwise ERK activity shifts during somitogenesis, which are robust against noise, are generated by a combination of factors including a continuous FGF gradient, cell-cell interactions, and the segmentation clock. The clock provides temporal regulation of the ERK activity bifurcation diagram, which reduces ERK activity spatial heterogeneity and enhances reproducibility. In the absence of the clock, the stepwise ERK activity shift still occurs, but with irregular timing and distance, leading to variable somite sizes. The authors propose that the clock has two roles: temporal regulation of ERK activity bifurcation and improvement of ERK-mediated somitogenesis reproducibility. The clock provides temporal information to reduce ERK activity spatial heterogeneity, allowing for reproducible somite formation. The authors' model was validated through experiments showing that stepwise ERK activity shifts occur in both control and clock-deficient embryos, which supports their conclusions.
The paper discusses how the oligomerization of protein subunits affects their intrinsic dynamics and functional dynamics. The authors analyze the dynamics of different protein members of the AAK family of enzymes, which have different degrees of oligomerization. They find that oligomerization tends to preserve the intrinsic dynamics of the monomeric subunits while also introducing new collective motions that are unique to the oligomeric state. The overall assembly of the subunits and their interface geometry plays a key role in defining the collective motions that are exploited by the oligomers. The study shows that oligomerization favors certain dynamic features of the monomers, while constraining others. This allows the oligomers to sample motions that are not accessible in the monomers, enabling them to perform functions like substrate binding and allosteric regulation. The authors propose that the design of the interface and oligomer geometry is crucial in defining the functional mechanisms of oligomers.
The paper discusses the role of human activities in the spread of rabies virus in dogs in North Africa. Using a probabilistic approach, the authors analyzed the spatial and temporal dynamics of rabies transmission in North Africa, where the virus has been endemic for over a century. They found that while dog populations in North Africa are enzootic, human activities such as travel and trade likely play a major role in the spread of the virus. The analysis revealed that while dog movements within countries are restricted by geopolitical boundaries, there is relatively fluid movement of rabies-infected dogs across countries, which suggests that human-mediated transmission is the primary factor in maintaining the virus' distribution. The authors used a phylogenetic approach to infer the evolutionary history of rabies virus in North Africa and then used a stochastic diffusion model to analyze the spatial dynamics of the virus within each country. They found that while there is some spatial structure within countries, human-mediated diffusion is the primary factor in shaping the spread of rabies in North Africa, particularly through roads and transportation infrastructure. This suggests that controlling the movement of infected dogs through human activities is critical for preventing the spread of rabies in North Africa, where current surveillance and testing methods are not sufficient.
The paper discusses the risk of dengue fever transmission during the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil. The authors analyzed historical data on dengue transmission in Brazil from 2010 to 2013 to estimate the risk of dengue during the World Cup. They found that the risk was low, except for Fortaleza and Brasilia, where the estimated risk was higher. They estimated that between 26 and 53 symptomatic dengue cases would occur among 60,000 tourists visiting Brazil during the World Cup, with the highest number expected among tourists from Germany, Mexico and Colombia. The estimated number of cases varied depending on assumptions about the number of visitors and their duration of stay. They found that the local transmission risk would likely be low due to high immunity among the local population and the short incubation period of the virus. The authors suggest that tourists can reduce their risk of dengue by staying in air-conditioned accommodations and using repellents. The Brazilian health authorities should provide information on local medical care facilities in case of symptoms and physicians in tourist countries should be aware of the possibility of dengue in returning travelers. Overall, the authors conclude that the risk of dengue transmission among tourists is low, but the actual number of cases could be higher than estimated due to uncertainties in visitor data and assumptions.
The paper describes a comprehensive study of the epigenetic and transcriptomic changes that occur during the differentiation of multipotent mesenchymal stem cells into mature brown adipocytes. The researchers used a protocol to differentiate C3H10T1/2 cells into mature brown adipocytes and compared the gene expression profiles at different stages of differentiation using RNA sequencing, ChIP-seq and microarray analysis. They identified four new regulators of brown adipocyte differentiation: the kinase PIM1, the transcription factor SIX1, the transcriptional activator RREB1 and the lncRNA SOX13. These factors were functionally validated by overexpressing them and measuring their effects on brown cell marker gene expression and mitochondrial function. The study also identified a number of brown selective genes and found that the pre-deposition of H3K4me1 during early stages of brown adipogenesis is essential for their expression at later stages. The findings provide a comprehensive dataset for understanding the molecular control of brown adipocyte differentiation and may lead to the development of new therapies for obesity and related diseases.
The paper discusses the results of a study comparing the performance of six reference centers in Brazil that routinely perform serological diagnosis of Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM). The study found that there were significant differences in the scores given by each center when their sera were assayed by the other centers, indicating a high rate of discordance. The discordance was found to be major in some cases, which could potentially lead to conflicting decisions regarding patient treatment. The main factors found to influence the accuracy of the serological results were the technique used (DID vs. CIE) and the type of antigen preparation (single isolate vs. pool). The study suggests that efforts should be made to standardize the serological diagnosis of PCM and develop standardized tests for the new species Paracoccidioides lutzii, which is endemic in some South American areas. The high discordance rates also suggest that there may be unnecessary prolongation of antifungal therapy in some cases.
The paper discusses the impact of the parasitic skin disease cutaneous leishmaniasis (CLM) on the quality of life of patients in a resource-poor community in the Amazonas State of Brazil. The study found that 94.5% of patients reported a reduction in their skin disease-associated life quality with a median score of 5 out of 10. The degree of impairment was positively correlated with the severity of the infection, the number of affected body areas, and the presence of lesions at clearly visible parts of the body. The most common restrictions were pruritus, sleep disturbance, feeling of shame and the need to dress differently. The researchers conclude that the impairment in quality of life is caused by the parasitic disease itself and not the low socioeconomic conditions of the community, as the impact of CLM was similar to that found in patients with other parasitic infections. A single dose of ivermectin treatment was found to resolve the lesions and restore skin-associated life quality to normal within one month.
The paper discusses the results of estimating the daily survival rate and population size of a population of the sandfly species Lu. longipalpis in an urban area of Brazil where visceral leishmaniasis is endemic. The study found that the daily survival rate for females was around 0.79 and 0.89, while that for males was around 0.74. The population size was estimated to be around 2,82-953 males and 90-4,857 females. The survival rate for females was lower due to the low recapture rate when they were released. The dispersion of the sandflies was limited, with most being recaptured within 10 meters of the release point. The estimated population size was highest during the rainy season when the risk of transmission to humans and dogs increased. The study provides the first published information on the daily survival rate of this species under natural conditions, which could inform the development of models to evaluate prevention and control measures. The results suggest that environmental management in the peridomiciliary environment could reduce the vector density and impact the transmission dynamics of visceral leishmaniasis.
The paper discusses how bacteria like Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) infect the intestinal epithelium and manipulate it to colonize the gut. They use a type three secretion system (TTSS) to translocate proteins that subvert host cell processes and promote colonization. The TTSS apparatus includes effectors like Tir, NleB, NleC, NleD, and NleE that suppress inflammatory responses. The authors found that deleting these effectors reveals that NF-κB activation by EPEC is dependent on the TTSS itself, not specific effectors. The TTSS apparatus seems to be sensed by the host cells, possibly through a cytoplasmic or membrane-embedded sensor. The authors suggest that the host detects an active TTSS by a sensor, possibly a structural element of the pore, rather than a specific effector. The TTSS-mediated pathway converges with other pathways that lead to NF-κB activation, and the precise cue that is sensed is yet to be defined. The results suggest that the TTSS-mediated response provides a role for EPEC to establish a long-term carrier state in the gut, allowing it to colonize the gut.
The paper describes how molecular dynamics simulations were used to predict the binding interactions of the RNA-binding protein Rbfox to the RNA pre-miR20b. The protein was engineered to have higher affinity for the target RNA sequence pre-miR20b compared to the wild type RNA pre-miR20b. The simulations were used to predict the binding interface and interactions between the protein and RNA, and identify mutations that would further improve affinity and selectivity. The simulations showed that the protein becomes less flexible upon binding to the RNA, which may provide a better steric fit for the RNA. The authors identified a mutation that would increase affinity and selectivity by placing a bulkier side chain at position 151 instead of the currently flexible side chain at position 151. The mutation was predicted to decrease the flexibility of the protein's β3 loop, which interacts with the RNA, while maintaining interactions with the RNA's β2 loop. The mutation was validated through additional simulations and was found to increase the affinity and selectivity of the engineered protein for the target RNA sequence. The simulations provided a detailed picture of the binding interface and interactions between the protein and RNA, which was used to guide the design of the mutations.
The paper describes the expression, purification, and biochemical characterization of a serine protease enzyme called SmSP2 from Schistosoma mansoni. The enzyme is found in adult schistosomes and has a unique domain organization that is distinct from other serine proteases. It has a trypsin-like substrate binding groove but contains a histidine stretch that may bind metal ions. The enzyme was shown to cleave various physiologically relevant host proteins, including fibronectin, plasminogen, tissue plasminogen activator, and bradykinin. It was found to have a specificity for basic amino acids at the P1 position and could not cleave macromolecules. This suggests it is a trypsin-like enzyme with a more narrow substrate specificity than trypsin. The enzyme is present in the tegument of adult schistosomes and is involved in modulating the host's vascular environment, possibly to promote parasite survival. The study proposes that SmSP2 may play a role in promoting fibrinolysis by activating plasminogen to plasmin, processing tPA to the double-chain form, producing bradykinin, and degrading fibronectin.
The paper discusses how the γ T cells (Vδ2 cells) in mice can protect against mouse Cytomegalovirus (MCV) infection. The study found that γ T cells are as effective as α T cells in protecting mice against MCV infection, and that γ T cells can control MCV multiplication in the absence of α T cells. The authors showed that γ T cells are sufficient to protect mice from MCV infection, even when the α T cells are deficient. They found that γ T cells expand in the liver and lungs after MCV infection, and that this expansion is associated with an increase in the number of effector memory γ T cells. The study suggests that γ T cells may have a direct antiviral effect by promoting the accumulation of NK cells, but also that they may have an indirect effect by producing antiviral mediators. The results suggest that γ T cells could be useful for protecting against MCV infection in situations where α T cells are compromised, such as in transplant recipients on immunosuppressive drugs. The findings open new avenues for manipulating γ T cells to enhance their antiviral response in clinical settings.
This paper describes the results of a study analyzing the role of the Plasmodium cysteine protease inhibitor (PbICP) in the life cycle of the malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei. The researchers generated parasite clones with a conditional knockout of the pbicp gene, which encodes PbICP, and compared the phenotypes of these parasites to those of parasites with a constitutive expression of the pbicp gene. They found that parasites lacking PbICP had a number of defects, including impaired invasion of salivary glands and hepatocytes, reduced blood stage development, and abnormal motility. The study suggests that PbICP plays a crucial role in regulating the activity of cysteine proteases during the liver stage development of the parasite, particularly in gliding motility and merozoite formation. The results provide evidence that PbICP is essential for both sporozoite invasion of salivary glands and hepatocytes in mosquitoes and mammalian hosts, and may be a suitable target for pre-erythrocytic intervention strategies.
The paper discusses the role of the histone variant H2A.Z in regulating gene expression during embryonic stem cell differentiation. H2A.Z has a unique acidic patch that contains three divergent residues compared to H2A, which are important for its function. The authors found that disrupting this acidic patch in H2A.Z leads to reduced expression of genes that are poised to activate, or "bivalent" genes. They propose that the acidic patch is necessary for maintaining the poised state of these bivalent genes, which allows for proper induction of gene expression during developmental cues. The reduced expression of bivalent genes upon H2A.Z disruption suggests that the dynamic association of H2A.Z with chromatin is required for proper regulation of gene expression during lineage commitment. The authors also found that H2A.Z is less associated with chromatin in ESCs compared to H2A, which may be due to the dynamic nature of H2A.Z. The dynamic association of H2A.Z with chromatin is also linked to its higher expression of bivalent genes. The paper provides mechanistic insights into the role of the divergent acidic patch as a structural determinant that links chromatin dynamics, gene regulation, and ultimately cell fate during embryonic development.
This paper describes a method to study cell lineage dynamics in the intestinal epithelium using somatic mutations. The method involves analyzing the genomic signatures of cells in mice that have a mutation in the MMR gene, which leads to a higher mutation rate. The mutations accumulated during cell divisions endow each cell with a unique genomic signature that can be used to reconstruct cell lineage trees. The authors applied this method to study the intestinal epithelium and found that monoclonal conversion occurs in stem cells, meaning that each stem cell becomes the ancestor of all cells in a crypt, and they do not retain an immortal strand. They also found that colon crypts are clustered separately from other cell types such as bone marrow stem cells, indicating that the colon has a distinct progenitor pool. The method was validated by showing that single cells from the same crypt are always clustered on the lineage tree, whole crypts have an elongated branch length with age, and the depth of single cells to their MRCSC is similar to the depth of whole crypts. The method was also used to show that the colon has a distinct progenitor pool, with colon crypts being much deeper than other cell types. This method can be applied to other tissues and stem cells where specific markers are lacking, providing new insights into stem cell dynamics.
The paper discusses how researchers used humanized mice to study the impact of antiretroviral therapy (ART) on HIV infection in the body. They found that ART is not able to completely eliminate HIV-infected cells, but it does reduce the amount of HIV RNA producing cells in various tissues. The researchers then tested an immunotoxin called 3B3PE38 that targets the HIV envelope protein glycoprotein gp120. They found that 3B3PE38 reduced the amount of HIV RNA producing cells in various tissues, including the bone marrow, spleen, lymph nodes, liver, lung and intestines, by 3-4 logs compared to ART alone. This suggests that targeted killing of infected cells during the plateau phase of ART may augment the reduction in HIV RNA levels. The study demonstrates that systemic penetration of ART into different organs is sufficient to reduce the number of HIV producing cells throughout the body, but HIV persists in all tissues during ART. The results provide proof of concept for targeted cytotoxic therapy as a complement to ART for the depletion of HIV-infected cells, which could be a critical component of an effective HIV eradication strategy.
The paper discusses the sensitivity and specificity of two commercial tests, Platelia ELISA and NS1-LRT, for detecting dengue fever in Vietnamese patients. These tests detect the presence of the NS1 protein in patients' blood plasma. The researchers found that the Platelia ELISA was more sensitive than the NS1-LRT in detecting dengue in patients within 3 days of illness onset, while the NS1-LRT was more specific. However, the sensitivity of both tests declined with increasing time since illness onset and was lower in patients with secondary dengue infections. They also found that higher viraemia levels were associated with a higher likelihood of being NS1 positive. The study suggests that the NS1-LRT test may be useful for rapid screening in primary healthcare settings, but the Platelia ELISA is more accurate for diagnosing dengue in patients with severe clinical presentations. The findings have implications for understanding the relationship between viraemia levels, disease severity, and the usefulness of early NS1 detection for predicting complications. The study highlights the importance of understanding the limitations of these tests in clinical settings.
The paper investigates why many people in an urban area of Blantyre, Malawi did not take their dogs to static vaccination points to get rabies vaccinated. The study found that distance from the dog owner's home to the nearest vaccination point was an important factor, with owners willing to travel up to 1.5 km to get their dog vaccinated. Owners who lived in poorer areas were more likely to take their dogs to the vaccination point. Owners of puppies or dogs that roamed were less likely to bring their dogs. Lack of awareness of the vaccination campaign and difficulty in handling dogs were also common reasons for not attending. The study suggests that improving positioning of vaccination points, providing timely information about vaccination campaigns, and educating owners on how to safely handle dogs could help increase vaccination coverage. The authors hope that their findings will help inform future vaccination campaigns to achieve high vaccination coverage through static points without the need for expensive door-to-door campaigns.
The paper describes a study on the interactions between the tsetse fly (Glossina morsitans) and the parasitic protozoan Trypanosoma brucei. The tset fly's salivary glands are important for transmitting the parasite to the mammalian host, and the parasite's infection of the salivary glands causes changes in the composition of the saliva. The study used RNA sequencing to compare the transcriptomes of infected and uninfected tset salivary glands and found that most of the secreted proteins in the saliva are reduced in expression upon in infected glands. This reduction likely impacts the host-parasite interactions at the bite site. The analysis also identified new and differentially expressed genes in the infected and uninfected salivary gland transcriptomes, which may be involved in the parasite's adaptation to the different host environments. The study provides new insights into the molecular aspects of the tsetse-trypanosome interactions and has potential for developing novel transmission blocking vaccines.
The paper discusses the discovery of new antileishmanial compounds produced by bacteria that live in symbiosis with certain species of ants. The researchers found that certain bacteria associated with ants produce compounds that are toxic to the parasitic fungus Leishmania donovani, which causes visceral leishmaniasis. They isolated and characterized four new antileishmanial compounds from actinobacteria that were identified as Mer-A2026B, piericidin-A1, nigerin, and dinactin. These compounds showed high activity against both the promastigote and intracellular amastigote stages of Leishmania, indicating that they could be useful for treating the parasite. The compounds are ionophores that transport ions across cell membranes, which could potentially disrupt Leishmania's membrane function and lead to its death. The authors argue that natural products offer a rich source of structural diversity for designing new antileishmanial drugs, as opposed to high-throughput screening of synthetic compound libraries. The discovery of these compounds from bacteria associated with ants suggests a promising new approach for identifying new drugs for treating leishmaniasis, which is currently understudied.
The paper discusses the genetic structure of Trypanosoma brucei, a parasite that causes African Trypanosomiasis (Sleeping Sickness) in humans. The researchers analyzed samples from different foci of disease in Uganda and Malawi to determine if the parasites are clonal or panmictic. They found that the Malawi population is genetically diverse and shows allelic segregation, indicating that mating occurs in the field. In contrast, the Ugandan populations are clonal, primarily evolving by mitotic division and mutation. The Malawi population shows evidence of genetic exchange and is not distinguishable from Trypanosoma brucei. The researchers conclude that the ability of Trypanosoma brucei to undergo genetic exchange may have been lost in Ugandan populations, allowing the Ugandan populations to remain clonal. The findings provide insight into the role of mating in shaping the population dynamics of this subspecies and have implications for understanding the evolution of sexual recombination within trypanosomes.
The paper describes how the brain's neural networks can learn to encode information through the selective strengthening of connections based on the timing of pre- and post-synaptic spikes, known as spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). The authors investigated how STDP can selectively strengthen connections in a recurrent neural network receiving oscillatory inputs. They found that the network can learn to encode the modulation frequency of the inputs by adjusting the axonal delay between connections, which becomes tuned to the frequency of the training inputs. The network can also selectively respond to different input frequencies after learning, with different axonal delays. The authors demonstrated that the network's ability to encode different frequencies depends on the amplitude of the oscillations and the strength of the inputs, and that the network can become selectively responsive to the training frequency after learning. The results suggest that STDP can help the brain learn how to encode information through the selective strengthening of connections based on the timing of spikes, and that this mechanism may be relevant for perception of missing frequencies in sounds.
The paper discusses a mathematical model that predicts the effectiveness of using systemic insecticides to reduce the transmission of Leishmania infantum, the etiological agent of visceral Leishmaniasis, in humans and dogs. The model assumes that only infected dogs are capable of infecting sand flies, and that sand flies are the main reservoir for transmission. The model shows that community-wide use of systemic insecticides in dogs could significantly reduce the number of human infections with L. infantum. The model identifies the minimum requirements for the systemic insecticide (efficacy and duration) and intervention (dog treatment coverage) needed to achieve a 50% reduction in human infections. The authors find that reducing sand fly mortality has the greatest impact on reducing human infections, followed by coverage of dogs and duration of insecticide efficacy. While there are challenges to implementing this intervention, the model suggests that systemic insecticides could be a useful alternative or complementary strategy to current control measures to reduce transmission of L. infantum in endemic regions where current methods are failing.
This paper discusses the mechanisms by which the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum releases its apical organelles (micronemes and rhoptries) during the invasion of red blood cells. The parasite releases these organelles in a coordinated manner, with micronemes being released first followed by rhoptries. The researchers identified that exposure to low potassium ions, which is found in blood plasma, triggers the release of micronemes from intracellular stores within the parasite. They showed that this exposure to low potassium ions leads to an increase in intracellular calcium levels in the parasite, which in turn triggers the release of micronemes. The release of micronemes is followed by receptor engagement with their erythrocyte receptors, which triggers the release of rhoptries. They demonstrated that the release of micronemes and rhoptries is triggered by distinct signals, with micronemes being released before rhoptries. The study identifies the external signals that trigger the release of micronemes and rhoptries and provides a model for how these organelles are released during invasion. This understanding of the invasion process could be used to develop novel drugs that target these steps to block the invasion and limit malaria.
The paper discusses how anti-angiogenic drugs can improve drug delivery in tumors by restoring normal vessel function. Tumors have abnormal blood vessels that impair drug delivery. Anti-angiogenic drugs reduce the number of vessels and leakiness, which decreases interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) within the tumor. This decrease in IFP can restore convective transport of drugs from vessels into the tumor interior, which was previously impaired by high IFP in the tumor periphery. The paper uses a mathematical model to simulate the tumor microenvironment and show that anti-angiogenic therapy can improve drug delivery by decreasing vessel density and leakiness, while also reducing tumor growth. However, the model does not consider the impact of functional vessel permeability, which can also affect drug delivery. The model shows that administering anti-angiogenic drugs at the right dose can restore convective transport and improve drug delivery in the tumor interior, but the delivery benefit is underestimated as it also reduces blood perfusion. Targeted therapies that focus on a specific area of the tumor and avoid heterogeneous drug accumulation may be more effective in providing effective treatment. The paper concludes that anti-angiogenic therapy can provide simultaneous access to the tumor periphery and center for drug delivery, but the dose of chemotherapy should be increased to ensure similar drug exposure.
The paper discusses how the virus HIV uses a mechanism to evade the host immune system by capturing and transferring to immune cells through a specific receptor called CD169 on the surface of immature dendritic cells. Immature dendritic cells have high levels of a receptor called DC-SIGN, which allows them to capture HIV particles and transfer them to T cells for in an efficient manner. However, maturation of immature dendritic cells through stimuli like TLR ligands, interferon alpha, or TNF alpha results in a decrease in DC-SIGN expression and an increase in expression of CD169, which allows HIV particles to capture and transfer through CD169. CD169 is also found on myeloid dendritic cells and macrophages, which can transfer HIV particles to T cells in a GM3-dependent manner. The paper suggests that HIV uses this mechanism to subvert the host immune response by exploiting DC functions to promote its replication. The results provide insights into how HIV evades the immune system and may help inform strategies to combat HIV infection.
The paper describes a study on how changes in a specific enzyme involved in making proteoglycans (PGs) in zebrafish affects the development of their bones. The enzymes Fam20b and Xylt1 are involved in making chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs), which are important for cartilage matrix production. Mutations in these enzymes in zebrafish larvae were found to cause increased perichondral bone, or bone formation in the perichondrium around chondrocytes. The researchers found that this acceleration in bone formation was caused by premature expression of chondrocyte maturation markers, including Indian hedgehog (Ihh), and the transcription factor Runx2. This suggests that the mutations in Fam20b and Xylt1 caused chrocyte maturation to happen too early, which in turn led to the increased perichondral bone. The study provides a new insight into how changes in PG synthesis enzymes during development can impact the timing of skeletal development and bone formation.
The paper discusses a study on the ecology of Severe fever with Thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV), a newly identified tick-borne virus that causes a deadly disease in humans. The researchers collected ticks from vegetation and wild animals in an SFTS endemic area in Jiangsu province, China and tested for the presence of SFTSV RNA in ticks and small mammals. They found that SFTSV RNA was present in both feeding and questing ticks of the species Haemaphysalis longicornis and Haemaphys flava, indicating that the virus could be transmitted through ticks. They also detected SFTSV RNA in unfed larvae of Haemaphys longicornis, indicating that it may be vertically transmitted. They also found SFTSV antibodies in small mammals like Erinaceus europaeus and Sorex araneus, suggesting that these animals may act as amplifying hosts for the virus. In addition, they found SFTSV RNA in migratory bird species Anser cygnoides and Streptopelia chinensis, suggesting that birds could also play a role in transmitting the virus long distances through flyways. These findings suggest that Haemaphys longicornis may serve as a natural reservoir for SFTSV, while small mammals like Erinaceus europaeus may maintain and amplify the virus for long periods of time. The study provides insights into the transmission dynamics of SFTSV, which could help formulate measures to prevent its spread.
The paper describes how the authors used single-cell RNA sequencing to study how the alga Emilianthus huxleyi is infected by the virus EhV201. They found that there is significant variability in the expression of viral genes within infected cells, with some cells expressing little or no viral genes while others express high levels. They identified two distinct phases of infection: an early phase where cells show early induction of host metabolic genes and an later phase where cells exhibit high levels of viral gene expression. They propose that this cell-to-cell variability in metabolic state may play a role in determining susceptibility to infection. They also found that cells that are resistant to the virus have distinct expression profiles of metabolic genes compared to susceptible cells. The results suggest that single-cell analysis can provide valuable insights into the dynamics of host-virus interactions and the role of marine viruses in regulating algal blooms.
The paper proposes a novel method to study how genes change function in cancer cells compared to normal cells. The method uses a network diffusion approach to determine if genes have gained or lost specific functions in cancer cells, beyond just looking at differential expression levels. The authors analyze the protein-protein interaction network (PIN) for each sample and assign a function to each gene based on how similar it is to its neighbors in the PIN. They then compare the number of genes that exhibit a function in cancer and normal samples and test if the assignment is significantly different. They find that genes that lose functions in cancer tend to have elevated nonsense mutation frequencies, while genes that gain functions in cancer have elevated missense mutation frequencies. This suggests that the loss or gain of function in cancer is often caused by changes in the PIN rather than just expression levels. The method is able to identify functions that have gained or lost functions in cancer and predict patient survival outcomes based on these changes. The authors also show that the loss or gain of functions is associated with cancer subtypes and patient survival outcomes. Overall, the method provides a complementary view of gene function changes in cancer that is not captured by traditional gene expression analysis.
The paper studies how subsequent infections with different influenza A subtypes affect the immunity of mallards. The study found that subsequent infections with the same subtype do not provide complete immunity to subsequent infections, but instead provide partial immunity that can reduce the transmission potential of that subtype. However, subsequent infections with heterologous subtypes do provide some boost in immunity and reduce viral shedding. The immunity to the original subtype does not completely disappear over time. The study also found that the degree of immunity to the original subtype influences the degree of immunity to subsequent subtypes, with more immunity to the original subtype resulting in a longer duration of immunity to that subtype. The results suggest that cross-immunity between subtypes may play a role in shaping the antigenic diversity of wild bird populations, where multiple subtypes co-circulate. The findings provide insights into how immunity to different subtypes of influenza A viruses may interact and affect the spread of the virus in wild bird populations.
The paper describes a mechanism of gene regulation for plasmids that allows them to transfer genetic material between bacteria. The plasmid pLS20cat from Bacillus subtilis has a gene called rcoLS20 that represses the genes that allow it to transfer genetic material. This gene is repressed by a peptide called Phr*LS20, which is produced by the bacteria. When enough Phr*LS20 peptides are produced, the rcoLS20 gene is inactivated, allowing the genes to transfer genetic material. This is different from other plasmids that have two signaling peptides that activate the genes. The study shows that the Phr*LS20 peptide acts as a quorum sensing signal, only allowing the genes to transfer when donor cells are surrounded by recipient cells. The findings provide insight into how plasmids spread genetic material and could help control the spread of antibiotic resistance.
The paper describes a study on how the dengue virus infects the Aedes aegypti mosquito. The mosquitoes have different levels of susceptibility to the virus, with some being more resistant and others being more susceptible. The researchers used genome-wide transcriptomics to identify which genes were differentially expressed in mosquitoes that were either susceptible or resistant to the virus. They found that susceptible mosquitoes had higher levels of genes related to energy metabolism and DNA replication, while resistant mosquitoes had genes related to cell growth and death. They identified several key pathways that were enriched among the differentially expressed genes, including the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. They also found that genes related to vacuolar trafficking were differentially expressed between susceptible and resistant mosquitoes. They suggest that these pathways may play roles in the mosquito's response to the virus, and that the more complex defense mechanisms in resistant mosquitoes may help explain why they are less susceptible to infection. Overall, the study suggests that mosquito vector competence to the virus reflects greater evolutionary complexity and that analyzing gene expression patterns across different mosquito populations may provide insights into how to develop new intervention strategies.
The paper discusses how mass distribution of ivermectin (a drug used to treat onchocercias) has been shown to reduce the prevalence and intensity of loiasis infection in areas where both onchocercias and loias are endemic. While ivermectin can reduce the load of loa microfilaria in the blood, it does not completely eliminate the infection. Despite this, mass distribution of ivermectin in areas of high loias endemicity has been shown to reduce the proportion of individuals with high and very high loa microfilaria loads, which in turn reduces the risk of developing severe adverse events associated with high loa infection. However, many individuals in these areas refuse to take ivermectin due to perceived fear of adverse events. This limits the impact of ivermectin on loias transmission and control. Alternative strategies to eliminate onchocercias and loias in areas where they co-occur are needed, such as targeting the vectors (Chrysops spp) or developing drugs that can safely treat loa patients. The study highlights the need for research to develop safe drugs to combat loias in order to effectively eliminate both onchocercias and loias in areas where they co-occur.
This paper investigates how the orientation of genes affects the replication of DNA during cell growth. The researchers found that when genes are transcribed in the opposite direction of their replication, it slows down the replication process, especially for genes that are transcribed highly. They found that genes that are transcribed in the opposite direction of replication are less likely to be transcribed at all, which is called co-orientation. They constructed bacteria with genes transcribed in the opposite direction of their replication to test this effect. They found that bacteria with this orientation had slower growth rates in rich medium and more DNA damage, indicating that the replication process was disrupted. They also found that genes that are transcribed in the opposite direction of replication were less likely to be transcribed at all, which is called co-orientation. They propose that the orientation of genes affects the genome organization and fitness of bacteria and that bacteria have evolved to minimize genome instability by avoiding head-on transcription.
This paper describes a new method for infecting and manipulating Schistosoma mansoni, a parasitic flatworm that causes the neglected tropical disease schistosomiasis, with lentiviruses like HIV-1. The researchers were able to demonstrate that HIV-1 can infect and integrate into the chromosomes of Schistosoma mansoni, which has been difficult to do in the past due to the complex developmental cycles of the parasite. They used pseudotyped HIV-1 virions with a receptor protein called VSV-G to attach to the surface of schistosomes and infect them, and then showed that HIV-1 reverse transcribes its genome and integrates into the genome of the parasite. This provides a new tool for studying the biology of the parasite and related neglected tropical diseases, as lentiviruses are more efficient at infecting non-dividing cells. The study shows that HIV-1 can infect Schistosoma mansoni in a way that is different from other retroviruses like MLV, and that the parasite's nuclei can import the virus independently of the nuclear envelope. The researchers also identified integration sites in the genome and found that HIV-1 integrates into both coding and non-coding regions. This work could enable the development of transgenic Schistosoma mansoni lines for studying gene knockout, gene editing and gene expression, and establishing gene drives to block the spread of the disease.
The paper investigates the presence of post-translational modifications (PTMs) within the major leptospiral protein LipL32, specifically lysine modifications, in leptospires isolated from rat urine and cultured in vitro. They found that PTMs occur only on lysine residues within LipL3 isolated from rat-isolated leptires and not in vitro-cultured Leptospira. PTMs were detected on five lysine residues in LipL3, including K152, K16, K172, K178, K19 and K246. These modifications were found to occur in regions of LipL32 that have been identified as antigenic and immunogenic, and were associated with a decrease in reactivity to the modified peptides by patient serum compared to the unmodified peptide. The modifications may affect calcium binding and thus impact LipL32 functions linked to calcium binding, such as immune modulation. The findings suggest that PTMs may play a role in the persistence of Leptospira within the renal tubules, allowing the bacteria to maintain high levels of shedding and transmission. The study provides insight into the potential functional and immunological consequences of PTMs within LipL32 and provides a potential mechanism for how Leptospira establishes chronic infection in rats and humans. The authors propose that PTMs may decrease humoral and cell-mediated immune recognition of LipL32, contributing to bacterial persistence. Further studies on the temporal occurrence, prevalence and biological relevance of PTMs within Leptospira could help elucidate the function of this abundant protein and reveal a novel mechanism of immune evasion.
This paper investigated how multiple inflation of different epitopes from different viruses affects the existing memory T cell compartment. The authors found that mice are able to accommodate multiple inflating memory T cell populations from different viruses at different times without any obvious impact on the existing memory cells. However, acute infections can cause rapid depletion of existing memory cells, especially effector memory cells. The authors suggest that this depletion is likely due to an indirect effect of the viral infection, such as the activation of natural killer cells or the activation of the innate immune response. The memory cells are able to recover after a time, but the depleted cells do not fully recover. The findings suggest that the capacity of the immune system to accommodate multiple inflation epitopes from different viruses may depend on the timing of pathogen acquisition and the ability of the virus to activate antigen-presenting cells. This study may have implications for developing T cell vaccines that generate long-lived memory cells.
This paper investigates the role of the doublesex gene in the development of sexually dimorphic mandibles in the stag beetle, Cyclommatus metallifer. The doublesex gene produces four different splice variants that are expressed sex-specifically, with males expressing the male-specific variant and females expressing the female-specific variant. The researchers found that the male-specific variant promotes mandible growth and the female-specific variant inhibits it. They showed that knocking down the doublesex gene in females caused their mandibles to be more like those of males, with more growth and sensitivity to a hormone that stimulates mandible growth. The results suggest that a link exists between the doublesex gene and the hormone signaling pathway, with the doublesex gene regulating mandible growth in a sex-specific manner. The researchers propose that the doublesex gene may act in parallel with the hormone signaling pathway to regulate mandible growth in males, but that other mechanisms may also be involved. They suggest that the insulin signaling pathway may be involved in regulating mandible growth in stag beetles, and propose that a rich interplay exists between endocrine and sex determination pathways.
The paper describes a genetic screening approach to identify genes that contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction and reduced insulin secretion in type 2 diabetes (T2D. They used trisomy 21 mice that have extra copies of chromosome 1 and human islets from T2D patients. They found that one gene, Regulator of Calcineurin 1 (RCAN1), was overexpressed in the trisomy 2 mice and human T2D islets and caused mitochondrial dysfunction and reduced insulin secretion. RCAN1 overexpression reduced ATP production and mitochondrial function, leading to low ATP levels. They showed that RCAN1 overexpression in mice and human islets correlated with increased glucose tolerance and hyperglycemia. The study suggests that RCAN1 expression may be a key regulator of mitochondrial function in T2D beta cells, and that increased RCAN1 expression may contribute to the development of T2D by reducing ATP availability.
This paper proposes a new method called Affinity Propagation (AP) clustering to group Rabies virus (RABV) isolates into subspecies based on their full genome sequences. The method is able to distinguish four main clusters: a New World, Arctic-like, Cosmopolitan and Asian clusters. Previous studies have identified up to 111 clusters based on partial genome sequences. The AP method overcomes some limitations of phylogenetic analysis by providing non-hierarchical, unequal-sized clusters that are based on mathematical algorithms rather than subjective criteria. The AP method is faster and more robust than phylogenetic analysis, allowing the identification of more clusters, including an additional one identified by phylogenetic analysis but not by AP. The results show that AP clustering can be used to group RABV isolates into four main clusters, but more sequences from previously underrepresented regions are needed to confirm the existence of an additional cluster. The approach provides a more transparent and faster method for analyzing RABV subspecies demarcation.
This paper discusses the role of the transcription factor Sox10 in the development and myelination of oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system. Sox10 is required for terminal differentiation and myelination of oligodendrocytes in the CNS. The authors show that Sox10 induces the transcription factor Myrf, which then teams up with Sox10 to activate myelin genes. They identify a conserved enhancer element in the Myrf gene, ECR9, that is bound by Sox10 and required for Myrf activation. They demonstrate that ECR9 is an oligodendroglial enhancer that is specifically bound by Sox10 in differentiating oligodendrocytes and transgenic animals, and directs reporter gene expression to differentiating oligodendrocytes. They propose a model in which Sox10 induces Myrf, which then cooperates with Myrf to activate myelin genes, providing a positive feedforward mechanism for myelination. This is similar to the model found in Schwann cells, where Sox10 induces Oct6, which cooperates with Krox20 to activate terminal differentiation and myelination. The study highlights the importance of Sox10 as a key regulator of oligodendrocyte development and myelination.
The paper proposes a new measure called the "regularity index" (R) to quantify how clustered or regular the branch points and terminal points are in a neuron's dendritic tree. R is based on comparing the nearest neighbor distances between points in the tree to the expected distances under a uniform distribution with the same number of points. The authors found that the R values of branch points and terminal points in real dendrites correlated little with other commonly used branching statistics, indicating that R is a useful new measure of dendritic tree morphology. They also showed that R values were better predictors of the input organization, with higher R values resulting in dendrites with more densely packed branch points. They showed that R could be used to predict the number of inputs and total length of branch points, but not the branching angles or order of branch points. They demonstrated the measure using simulations of realistic dendritic morphologies and compared it to actual reconstructions of dendrites. The authors conclude that R provides a new and useful way to quantify the relationship between a neuron's dendritic tree structure and its input architecture.
The paper investigates how dietary zinc intake affects susceptibility to pneumocococcal infection. The authors found that mice fed a low zinc diet had higher levels of Streptococococcus pneumoniae in their lungs and blood compared to mice fed a standard diet. Zinc deficiency compromised the ability of phagocytic cells (white blood cells) to kill the bacteria, leading to increased bacterial burden and reduced survival time. Zinc supplementation of phagocytic cells reduced bacterial survival within cells, suggesting that zinc intoxication of the cells directly impacted the pathogen. Zinc levels were higher in the lungs of zinc-restricted mice, which is consistent with zinc-deficient mice having higher bacterial burden. Zinc deficiency also led to increased inflammatory responses, but did not affect immune cell recruitment. The study shows that zinc deficiency compromises host control of pneumococcal infection by impairing the ability of phagocytic cells to kill bacteria, providing a mechanistic basis for the link between dietary zinc intake and increased susceptibility to pneumococcal infection.
The paper describes the identification and analysis of downstream antisense transcription starting sites (daTSSs) in human T4D/A1 cells. DaTSSs are located between gene transcription start sites (TSSs) and are associated with promoter-proximal chromatin features like nucleosome depletion and histone modifications. The daTSSs are found to be enriched for Pol II-associated motifs and transcription factor binding sites, indicating that they are part of the promoter-specific chromatin environment. While daTSSs are associated with the downstream edge of promoter-proximal nucleosomes, they are not associated with active enhancers or stable RNA transcripts. The lack of association with active enhancers suggests that daTSSs are not primarily a repressive feature of genes. Instead, the paper argues that daTSSs are part of the intrinsic chromatin environment of promoters and contribute to the establishment of the promoter-specific chromatin structure. DaTSSs are found to be common in many human promoters and coincide with promoter-associated features like nucleosome depletion and histone modifications. The paper suggests that daTSSs may participate in signal-dependent modulation of epigenetic content and play a role in directing the positioning of nucleosomes and deposition of histone marks. The study provides evidence that daTSSs are encoded in genetic sequence and are part of the promoter-specific chromatin environment.
The paper discusses a new approach to diagnosing dengue fever infection in fatal cases using antigen capture kits. The researchers tested three different kits - Early ELISA, Platelia NS1 and NS1 Agrip - on tissue homogenates from 23 fatal cases of dengue in Brazil. They found that the NS1 Agrip kit was the most sensitive, detecting antigen in 91.3% of tissues, followed by the Platelia NS1 at 60.8% and the Early ELISA at 2.9%. The NS1 Agrip kit detected antigen in all tissues except lymph nodes, while the other two kits did not. The authors suggest that this approach could be useful for postmortem diagnosis and for low resource settings where necropsies are not available, as it requires only a small tissue sample. While the results suggest that the antigen may be present in tissues from the blood, further studies are needed to determine if it is truly in situ or from the blood. The findings indicate that liver tissue may be the best tissue for detecting dengue antigen. The detection of dengue antigen in tissues could provide insight into the pathogenesis of the disease and help understand how it spreads in the body.
The paper describes a study that tested the effectiveness of a crowdsourcing approach in increasing HIV testing among men who have sex with men (MSM) in China. The study used a stepped wedge cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) in 8 cities. The intervention consisted of a multimedia campaign, an online HIV testing service and local promotion campaigns tailored for MSM. The intervention was developed through crowdsourcing, involving 3 components: a nationwide contest, a regional designathon and local participatory contests. The study found that the crowdsourced intervention significantly increased HIV testing among MSM, especially HIV self-testing. The intervention was effective across all ages and cities, with 8.9% more HIV tests during the intervention period compared to the control period. The study suggests that crowdsourcing can be a useful way to develop community-driven HIV services that are tailored to local contexts. It also highlights the importance of social media interventions to reach young MSM and inform health policy. However, the study had some limitations, including self-reported data, high loss to follow-up and limited generalizability.
The paper discusses the function of a protein encoded by the owl monkey cytomegalovirus (OMCV) called A43. The protein is secreted from infected cells and can bind to the surface receptor CD48 on target cells, blocking the CD48:2B4 interaction and inhibiting cytotoxic cell responses by NK cells. The A43 protein acts as a decoy receptor, binding CD48 with high affinity and specificity to prevent CD48 from binding to its receptor 2B4 on target cells. This inhibition of CD48:2B4 interactions reduces the ability of NK cells to produce cytokines and form immune synapses with target cells, allowing the virus to evade the host immune response. The A43 protein also binds to human CD48 and can inhibit cytotoxic responses of human NK cells, indicating it may have similar effects on other immune cells. The study demonstrates that A43 serves as a novel mechanism for the virus to rapidly counteract host immune responses early after infection.
According to the paper, myelin in the brain is critical for proper nerve function. Myelin acts as an insulator and increases the electrical resistance across the cell membrane, allowing for faster nerve impulses to travel over long distances. Myelin is produced by specialized cells called oligodendrocytes in the peripheral nervous system and oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system. The high lipid content of myelin makes it vulnerable to metabolic disorders and lipid availability issues. The paper shows that oligodendrocytes depend on both endogenous lipid synthesis and extracellular lipids from astrocytes to produce a complete myelin membrane. When astrocyte lipid metabolism is compromised, oligodendrocytes incorporate lipids from the bloodstream into their myelin membrane, allowing for rescuing of hypomyelination. However, when astrocyte lipid metabolism is selectively compromised, oligodendrocytes are unable to produce a full myelin membrane and hypomyelination persists in adulthood. This suggests that endogenous lipid levels in oligodendrocytes are sufficient for initial myelin synthesis in the first weeks after birth, while subsequent elaboration of a full myelin membrane requires lipid supply from astrocytes. Dietary supplementation of astrocyte-derived lipids can improve myelination in some cases, but the extent of exogenous lipid uptake by oligodendrocytes has been underestimated. These findings have implications for understanding and treating myelin diseases that benefit from dietary supplementation.
The paper proposes a new method called gplmDCA to improve contact prediction in Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA) by learning a Potts model that includes gap parameters to describe the probability of a site being the beginning of a gap of length l. This gap. The additional gap parameters help the model learn the distribution of gaps in the data better and reduce the artifacts caused by repeated gaps in the multiple sequence alignments. The gplmDCA method is based on the recently developed asymmetric pseudo-likelihood maximization of the Potts model, which is faster than the original method. The authors show that adding gap parameters to the model significantly improves contact prediction for proteins with a low sequence similarity, especially those with fewer unique sequences in the alignment. However, some proteins with high sequence similarity still show improved prediction using the gap parameters. The method is able to predict more correct contacts for proteins with a larger number of sequences in the alignment. The authors believe that the gap parameters are a first step towards a rational approach to incrementally improving contact prediction.
The paper discusses the identification and analysis of Hantavirus (HTNV) epitopes (regions on the virus that can stimulate T-cells) that are restricted by specific HLA (human leukocyte antigen) alleles in Chinese Han population. The researchers identified five novel CTL epitopes on the HTNV nucleoprotein (NP) that were restricted by HLA-A1, HLA-A2, HLA-B5, and HLA-B7. They found that the frequency of epitope-specific CD8+ T-cells was higher in patients with mild/moderate disease than in severe/critical patients at the acute stage of infection, which suggests that these cells may play a role in controlling the virus load early on. However, the frequency of these epitope-specific CD8+ T-cells declined over time. The study also showed that both CD8lo and CD8hi T-cells, which are present in high and low numbers at the acute stage, can respond to the epitopes and produce IFN-γ and proliferate, but the CD8hi T-cells have a stronger proliferative capacity. The results suggest that single epitope-specific CD8+ T-cells may be important for controlling HTNV infection in acute stages of the disease, but more research is needed to fully understand the role of these cells in disease control.
The paper describes an analysis of how the Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014-2016 impacted the screening and care of patients with African trypanosomiasis (also known as sleeping sickness) in coastal areas of Guinea. The study found that during the Ebola outbreak, active screening campaigns to detect and diagnose patients were largely abandoned due to fear and mistrust of the healthcare system, leaving many infected individuals undiagnosed. Passive screening at health centers also decreased as people were less likely to attend. As a result, a higher proportion of patients were diagnosed at a late stage of the disease and had longer hospital stays after treatment, leading to increased disability adjusted life years (DALYs) and years lost (YLLs). The study suggests that the lack of active screening and passive detection likely left many infected individuals undiagnosed, which could have contributed to an increase in the burden of the disease. The findings suggest that active screening campaigns are important for controlling sleeping sickness in hard-to-reach areas and reducing the human reservoir of infected tset flies, but were limited during the Ebola outbreak.
This paper describes a genome-wide association study of schizophrenia using pooled DNA samples from men and women. The authors found one sex-specific association with a gene called Reelin (RELN) on chromosome 7. Specifically, they found that a variant in the 4th intron of the RELN gene (rs731475) was associated with schizophrenia more in women than men, with an odds ratio of 2.0 for women compared to 1.1 for men. The association was replicated in 3 other populations, including the Ashkenazi Jewish, UK, Irish, and Chinese samples. This suggests that sex hormones may modulate the expression of the RELN gene, which in turn may contribute to the difference in susceptibility to schizophrenia between the sexes. The authors conclude that the association between RELN and schizophrenia is likely to be a genuine finding, as it was not explained by population stratification and was replicated in multiple populations.
The paper describes how the researchers identified and characterized 12 novel genes in Candida albicans that are associated with oral candidiasis, a common oral infection caused by the fungus. They used a combination of genome-wide transcriptional profiling and gene knockout mutants to identify genes that were upregulated during oral infection. They found that one gene, DUR31, encoded a sodium substrate transporter, was specifically upregulated during oral candidiasis and required for epithelial damage and endothelial damage. The researchers showed that DUR3 mediates the import of polyamines, amino acids and urea, which are necessary for hyphal growth and filament formation. They also found that DUR3 is required for environmental alkalinization, which in turn allows for hyphal autoinduction. They showed that DUR3 is involved in the rapid onset of symptomatic systemic candidiasis but not its final conclusion, as deletion of DUR3 leads to reduced virulence in mice models. The researchers propose that DUR3 plays a key role in the rapid onset of symptoms by allowing the fungus to utilize distinct amine-containing substrates and facilitating hyphal growth, as well as mediating environmental alkalinization. The study provides insights into the mechanisms of oral candidiasis and highlights the importance of identifying novel genes involved in fungal virulence.
The paper describes a model of how B cells differentiate into different types of cells. They inferred a regulatory network from experimental data that describes the transitions between different states of B cells. The model consists of a set of nodes representing master regulators and signaling pathways. The nodes interact with each other in a way that allows the network to differentiate B cells into different cell types. The model was constructed in two forms: a discrete Boolean model and a continuous dynamical system. The continuous model was able to find additional attractors not found in the discrete model, which suggests that there may be intermediate states that B cells can transition to. The results of the continuous model were able to describe the known transitions between cell types observed in experiments. The model also predicts the existence of additional regulatory interactions that could play a role in the differentiation process, which can be tested experimentally. The paper shows that the network is able to control the differentiation of B cells towards a terminal effector cell fate in an irreversible manner, while allowing for plasticity of precursor states. The model can be used to test hypotheses regarding how deregulation of the known regulators could contribute to lymphoma.
The paper describes how high sugar consumption in Drosophila melanogaster flies can cause heart dysfunction and shortened lifespan. They show that flies fed a high sugar diet (HSD) exhibit heartbeat irregularities, shortened life span, and accumulation of collagen and triglycerides compared to those fed a low sugar diet (LSD). They identify two pathways, the insulin signaling pathway and the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, that seem to mediate these effects. Reducing activity of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway through genetic knockdown or inhibition of enzymes OGT or GFAT specifically in the heart leads to improved heart function in flies fed an HSD, indicating that hexosamine flux is involved in the heart damage. The study suggests that a balance of hexosamine flux is needed to maintain normal heart function, and that reducing hexosamine biosynthetic activity may be a potential therapeutic target.
The paper investigates how homologous chromosomes pair up in the early stages of meiosis in Drosophila germ cells. The authors found that while chromosome X is always paired, chromosomes II and III are mostly unpaired in the early stages of meiosis. However, some chromosome II centromeres begin to cluster and pair with chromosome X centromeres later on. They identified that centromere clustering in the early stages of meiosis depends on meiosis proteins like C(3)G and Corona, which localize close to the centromeres. These proteins help centromere association and clustering in the early stages of meiosis. However, some non-homologous interactions between chromosome X and III centromeres occur, suggesting that centromere association may be an extension of somatic pairing in germline cells. The study suggests that meiotic pairing in germ cells is not simply an extension of somatic pairing, but involves additional mechanisms. The findings provide insights into how homologous chromosome pairing in early meiosis may occur and how it is regulated.
The paper describes a new method to detect the injection of Yersinia enterocolitica effector proteins into host cells using a reporter gene that expresses a β-lactamase enzyme. The reporter system was validated in cell culture and then used to study the injection of effectors into mouse splenocytes. The results show that the reporter system can detect injection of effectors into various immune cells, including granulocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and B cells. The injection of effectors into B cells was found to activate B cells, indicating that interaction with Yersinia leads to B cell activation. The study also found that β-integrins are required for the injection of effectors into host cells. The reporter system was able to detect the injection of effectors into cells in vitro and in vivo, and was able to show that injection of effectors into splenocytes was associated with increased numbers of splenic B cells. The study demonstrates that the reporter system can be used to screen for genetic factors that affect Yersinia injection and identify drugs that target injection.
The paper investigates the role of interleukin-10 (IL-10) in dengue virus infection. The researchers found that patients with higher levels of IL-10 in their blood had lower responses to dengue virus specific T cells during acute infection, specifically those specific to the serotype of the infecting virus. This suggests that IL-10 may contribute to disease pathogenesis by inhibiting these T cell responses. However, IL-10 blockade actually increased antiviral responses such as interferon gamma production and T cell activation in these patients, suggesting that IL-10 may have a complex role in disease. While IL-10 levels were associated with more severe disease in some viral infections, the exact mechanisms are unclear. The main source of IL-10 in acute dengue infection appears to be monocytes, which are infected directly by the virus. Higher infection rates of monocytes may lead to higher IL-10 production, which in turn contributes to disease pathogenesis. The findings suggest that IL-10 may play a role in impairing T cell responses to the virus, but the exact mechanisms and consequences of this remain to be determined.
The paper describes how a drug called quinidine, which inhibits the formation of a heme crystal in the midgut of the triatomine insect Rhodnius prolix, affects the insect's redox balance and reproduction. The insects' midgut normally takes in a lot of blood to meet its energy needs, and the heme from the blood is converted into heme crystals to protect it from the heme's toxicity. However, when the heme crystal formation is inhibited, excessive heme accumulates in the midgut, causing redox imbalance. This in turn affects the insect's reproductive cycle, causing reduced oogenesis and egg laying. The insects' midgut cells are also affected, with organelles disappearing and mitochondria becoming less functional. The study shows that inhibiting heme crystal formation in the midgut leads to higher levels of heme in the hemolymph, which can cause oxidative damage. The study concludes that disrupting heme crystal formation in the midgut represents a key mechanism that allows the triatomine insect to allow T. cruzi parasites to proliferate in the insect's digestive tract by maintaining heme at a level that promotes parasite growth while minimizing parasite death. The study provides insights into how heme homeostasis is critical for both the insect vector and parasite, and highlights the potential for targeting this mechanism to develop new strategies for controlling Chagas disease transmission.
The paper discusses the limitations of using the ELISA test to diagnose brucellosis, specifically the detection of IgM antibodies in patients with negative IgG antibodies. The authors found that in some cases, patients were found to have positive IgM antibodies but negative IgG antibodies, which can lead to incorrect diagnosis of acute brucellosis. The authors conclude that the detection of IgM antibodies should not be regarded as definitive and that other diagnostic methods such as agglutination tests or PCR should be used to confirm the diagnosis. They also found that false positives can occur due to cross-reactions with other bacteria and rheumatoid factor, and that pre-absorption of rheumatoid factor is recommended before determining IgM antibodies. The authors recommend repeating the ELISA test after pre-absorbing rheumatoid factor and using other diagnostic methods to confirm the diagnosis. The study highlights the importance of interpreting the ELISA results with the patient's history and clinical features and other diagnostic test results to avoid misdiagnosis.
This paper describes an experiment to investigate how schistosome parasites manipulate snails to establish infections. Schistosomes infect snails by producing cercariae, which penetrate and develop into sporocysts in the snail. The snails have a natural resistance to schistosomes, but this resistance can be overcome by immunosuppression caused by the parasites. The study found that irradiated schistosome larvae can suppress the snail's defense responses, allowing some resistant snails to become infected with schistosomes. The study showed that FREP3, a fibrinogen-related protein, is an important factor in this immunosuppression and plays a role in preventing schistosome sporocyst development in resistant snails. However, the study also found that the effects of irradiated schistosomes are more effective than suppressing FREP3 in the snails, suggesting that irradiated schistosomes can provide longer-lasting immunosuppression. This provides a potential mechanism for parasites to colonize new snail hosts that would normally be resistant to them, resolving a paradox of why some parasites can infect new hosts. The study also suggests that up-regulating FREP3 expression in wild snails could help reduce schistosome infections, providing a new strategy for controlling schistosome transmission.
The paper describes an attempt to establish a therapeutic community in an African hospital serving long-term patients, specifically those with Buruli ulcers. This involves creating an open forum where patients and staff can speak freely about their concerns and problems, and establish mutual respect and trust. The hospital administration needs to recognize the value of this approach and be willing to engage in problem-solving processes. Health social scientists need to receive training to support this model, acting as facilitators and brokers. This approach improves communication, reduces uncertainty and discontent, and enhances patient and staff well-being. The pilot project was successful and led to more satisfied patients and staff, as well as increased patient education and referral of chronic ulcer cases. The authors argue that establishing a therapeutic community in African hospitals is feasible if hospital administrators recognize its benefits and health social scientists receive training to support it.
The paper describes a strategy for extending the lifespan of yeast cells by reducing the rate of sphingolipid synthesis. Sphingolipids are structural components of eukaryotic cells that have multiple functions, including regulating cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, senescence, inflammation, and stress resistance. The researchers found that lowering the rate of sphingolipid synthesis in yeast cells can increase lifespan by reducing the activity of the Sch9 protein, which regulates lifespan. They identified two ways that sphingolipids regulate Sch9 activity: by controlling the activity of the Pkh1/2 complex and by reducing the concentration of sphingolipids themselves. They showed that reducing sphingolipids leads to a reduction in the phosphorylation of Sch9 residue T570, which is essential for Sch9 activity. They also showed that reducing sphingolipids leads to an increase in resistance to heat, oxidative, and acid stress, as well as cell size, mitochondrial oxygen consumption, and genome stability. They propose that down-regulating sphingolipid synthesis is a promising strategy for extending lifespan in humans.
This paper investigates the role of intronic mutations, which are mutations within introns, in human genes. The study finds that intronic mutations are more common than expected and have different characteristics than exonic mutations. Intronic mutations tend to be loss of intronic regions, rather than gain of exonic regions. These mutations are found more often in older genes and have a higher enrichment in essential genes. Intronic mutations can affect gene expression by altering splicing recognition and RNA stability. The study also finds that intronic mutations are associated with regulatory regions, such as enhancers, and can affect gene expression in other cell types. The study suggests that intronic mutations may have a role in shaping gene evolution and fine-tuning gene regulation. However, the impact of intronic mutations on gene expression is likely underestimated and more research is needed to fully understand their effects.
The paper investigates how prior knowledge influences perception of degraded speech. The researchers found that when listeners have prior knowledge of what the spoken word will be, they are better able to perceive degraded speech. They tested this by having participants read written words that match the spoken word before hearing it, and comparing the brain activity in the posterior superior temporal sulcus (STS) while participants listened to degraded speech. They found that when the spoken word matches the prior knowledge, brain activity in the STS is reduced, suggesting that the expected part of the sensory input is "explained away". This is consistent with the prediction error theory that prior knowledge reduces the amount of information represented in the STS. However, when the spoken word does not match prior knowledge, the brain activity in the STS is increased, suggesting that the expected sensory input is "sharpened". This supports the idea that prior knowledge enhances the representation of expected sensory signals, not reduces them. The results suggest that the brain combines prior knowledge and sensory input in a way that reduces the amount of information represented when the input matches the prior knowledge and enhances the representation when it does not match.
The paper describes a study comparing the performance of three commercially available rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for diagnosing cystic echinococcosis, a parasitic infection caused by the larval stage of the tapeworm Echinocococcus granulosus. The RDTs were compared to the standard ELISA test commonly used in parasitology laboratories. The study found that while the RDTs had overall comparable performance to the ELISA test in diagnosing the different stages of cystic echinococcosis, significant differences in accuracy existed between the tests. The VIRapid HYDATIS test performed best among the RDTs, while the ADAMU-CE test was less sensitive in diagnosing active cysts and the DIGFA test was less specific when applied to samples from patients with non-parasitic cysts. The study suggests that RDTs may be useful in resource-poor settings where access to conventional serology tests is limited, but their sensitivity and specificity are limited in diagnosing inactive and early cysts. Further studies are needed to evaluate the performance of RDTs in follow-up of patients and in comparing the results with sera from patients with other parasites and cysts of different genotypes.
This paper discusses the potential use of a diagnostic test for detecting subclinical cases of leprosy, which are individuals who are infected with Mycobacterium leprae but do not yet show symptoms. The authors use a mathematical model to simulate the transmission of leprosy in households and evaluate the impact of different testing strategies on reducing the number of new cases of leprosy. They find that a diagnostic test with a sensitivity as low as 50% could still reduce the number of new cases by a significant amount, and that household contact tracing is more efficient than population surveys. However, population surveys would require more people to be tested and treated, especially in medium and low endemic settings. The authors conclude that a diagnostic test could be a useful tool to help reduce transmission of leprosy, but more research is needed to determine the best approach for implementation.
The paper discusses the results of a study on measuring immune responses after vaccination with the oral cholera vaccine Shanchol in Bangladesh. The study found that vaccination with Shanchol produced significant increases in plasma antibody and mucosal antibody responses against the O-specific polysaccharide (OSP) of Vibrio cholerae, specifically IgA and IgM responses. However, there was no evidence of any boosting of these immune responses after a second dose of the vaccine. The study suggests that this failure to boost immune responses may be due to the fact that cholera is a mucosal infection and immune responses at the mucosal surface are more important for protection. IgA antibody-secreting cell (ASC) responses in blood shortly after infection or vaccination may play a role in mediating long-term protection. The study also found that IgA OSP-specific circulating ASC responses were detected 7 days after vaccination but returned to baseline by 4 days later. The authors conclude that a single dose of Shanchol may be sufficient to mediate at least short-term protection against cholera in adults in highly cholera endemic areas, but further studies are needed to assess the association between immune responses and protection in children.
The paper describes an in-depth analysis of the genetic and genomic characteristics of Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa), a bacteria that causes canker and stem wilt diseases in kiwifruit. The analysis includes whole genome sequencing of 23 Psa isolates from different disease outbreaks in Japan, Korea, Italy and New Zealand. The study finds that each outbreak is from a distinct genetic lineage, with little diversity within each lineage but high diversity between the different outbreaks. This suggests that there is a single source population from which the different outbreaks have arisen. The paper identifies genes and effectors that may play a role in the evolution of the Psa-V strain that caused the recent global outbreak, including genes involved in metabolism and the type III secretion system. The study also compares the genomes of Psa isolates from different cultivars and finds that different cultivars have different growth dynamics, suggesting that the genetic differences between the Psa isolates are linked to their ability to cause disease in different kiwifruit varieties. The findings highlight the importance of understanding the source population and minimizing transmission of Psa from the source population to commercial orchards to prevent disease establishment and breeding programs focused on a single lineage.
The paper discusses the characterization of a CRISPR-Cas system found in Listeria monocytogenes that does not rely on Cas proteins for its function. The CRISPR system, called RliB-CRISPR, contains repeats that are processed by a bacterial enzyme called PNPase, which is able to degrade single-stranded RNA. The RliB-CRISPR is found in all Listeria genomes analyzed, even those that lack the Cas genes, and is able to confer DNA interference activity to bacteria that harbor a CRISPR-Cas system. The RliB-CRISPR is expressed and processed independently of the Cas proteins, and the processing is dependent on PNPase. The RliB-CRISPRs match spacers from temperate and virulent bacteriophages, and the DNA interference is dependent on the presence of PNPase. The authors propose that the RliB-CRISPR may have evolved a new function that is not related to immunity, such as RNA interference. The study paves the way for further research on the interactions between bacteriophages and bacteria and how they cooperate during in infection.
This paper proposes a new approach to inferring the contact structure of a population based on the phylogenetic tree of an infectious disease. The idea is to use the imbalance of the tree, which measures the difference between the actual transmission tree and the expected transmission tree under random mixing, to distinguish between different types of contact networks. The researchers show that the imbalance of the transmission tree depends on the contact structure of the population. They simulate epidemics on networks with different contact structures and find that the transmission trees exhibit strong differences from the expected random mixing tree. They apply their approach to real data from the Swiss HIV cohort study, which shows that the HIV transmission tree exhibits a strong imbalance, consistent with what would be expected based on known patterns of transmission within the population. They conclude that their approach can be used to study the contact structure underlying epidemics and provide insights into the mechanisms of epidemiology.
The paper describes a machine learning approach to predict which residues in a protein are important for allostery, or the ability of a protein to change its shape in response to binding of an effector molecule. The authors assembled a dataset of residues that were known to affect allostery and trained machine learning models to predict whether a residue is a hotspot (allostery residue) or not. They found that buried residues are more likely to be hotspots, as they tend to be buried and change their solvent exposure during the allosteric transition. The models used a combination of structural, dynamic, and network features, which provided a more complete picture of the residue's properties. They compared their predictions to known hotspots and non-hotspots and found good agreement. They also showed that predicted hotspots tend to occur in the interior of the protein, consistent with the known functional significance of the residues. They propose that predicted hotspots could be used as targets for drugs to modulate allostery in proteins, potentially as an alternative to direct mutation of allosteric sites. Overall, their approach provides a computational method to identify residues that may be important for allostery, which could help guide experimental mutagenesis studies.
This paper proposes a theoretical framework for predicting functional connectivity patterns in neural networks based on their structural topology. The authors used a simplified model of neural excitation, the SER model, to demonstrate the relationship between network topology and functional connectivity. They showed that network topology, rather than the specific model used, determines functional connectivity patterns. They identified key topological features that contribute to functional connectivity, including the number of modules and hubs. They developed analytical formulas based on the number of triangles and their proximity to the pair of nodes. The formulas were able to predict functional connectivity across a wide range of initial conditions and network topologies. They found that functional connectivity was highly specific to network topology, with modular networks showing strong positive correlations and random networks showing no or negative correlations. Their approach provides a fully analytic framework for predicting functional connectivity from network topology, which could be used to inform models of neural dynamics and brain function.
The paper describes a new method for studying the human bocavirus 1 (HBoV1), which is a common respiratory virus that is frequently detected in infants and young children. The researchers were able to clone the full length HBoV1 genome, sequence it, and generate virus from it that can infect polarized human airway epithelial cells in vitro. They found that HBoV1 infection of these cells disrupts the tight junctions that form the barrier between the cells, leading to the loss of cilia and epithelial cell hypertrophy. This suggests that HBoV1 may play a role in respiratory tract injury. They also found that a polarized cell culture model, CuFi-HAE, derived from cystic fibrosis cells, was able to support HBoV1 infection. This provides an alternative model for studying HBoV1 infection. The study demonstrates that HBoV1 can infect polarized epithelial cells in vitro, which may help researchers understand how it causes disease in vivo. The findings provide insights into how HBoV1 infection leads to the loss of cilia and barrier disruption in the respiratory tract.
This paper discusses how the Wnt signaling pathway is involved in regulating cellular processes during development and cell death in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. The authors find that a receptor protein called MOM-5 functions as a receptor for apoptotic cells and is required for cell corpse engulfment and spindle orientation. They propose that MOM-5 activates the Wnt pathway through a GEF complex containing the proteins CED-2 and CED-5, which in turn modulates the cytoskeleton. They find that MOM-5 and CED-1 act together as receptors for apoptotic cells, with MOM-5 required for DTC migration and spindle orientation, while CED-1 acts as a coreceptor for MOM-5. The authors propose that a signal from the apoptotic cell activates CED-1 on neighboring cells, which then polarizes the cytoskeleton to engulf the cell. The Wnt pathway is found to be involved in cell fate specification, spindle orientation, apoptotic cell clearance, and cell migration, and the authors suggest that a similar pathway may also contribute to cell polarity regulation in mammals. The study provides new insights into how cellular processes are coordinated during development and cell death.
The paper describes how the protein MZT1 is involved in building microtubules at non-centrosomal microtubule organizing centers (nMTOCs) in C. elegans. The authors used a genetic system to deplete early essential proteins in a tissue-specific manner, specifically the microtubule nucleating proteins GIP-1 and AIR-1, in the intestinal epithelial cells of C. elegans embryos. They found that while depletion of these proteins resulted in mitotic defects, microtubules still organized apically at the ncMTOCs, indicating that different MTOCs have different requirements for building microtubules. The results suggest that the centrosome and ncMTOCs have distinct requirements for microtubule organization. The study identifies MZT as a protein that localizes γ-TuRC components to the apical ncMTOC but does not recruit them to the centrosome, and instead serves as a "linker" between the γ-TuRC complex and the apical ncMTOC. The study also suggests that additional mechanisms beyond γ-TuRC and AIR-1 are required to build microtubules at ncMTOCs. The findings provide evidence that different MTOCs have different requirements for building microtubules and that more mechanisms remain to be identified.
The paper describes a computational method to predict the fitness landscape of HIV-1 proteins, which is the ability of the virus to evade immune responses. The method uses machine learning algorithms to identify vulnerable regions of the proteins that are likely to be targeted by immune responses and then predicts the fitness of different mutations in those regions. The authors tested their method on HIV-1 Gag proteins by measuring the fitness of various mutants in vitro. They found that their predictions were in good agreement with the actual fitness measurements of the mutants, showing that their model was able to accurately predict the fitness of different mutations. However, they also found that their predictions were less accurate when comparing absolute energy values between different proteins, suggesting that comparisons of energy differences may not be meaningful. They suggest that comparisons of relative fitness between proteins may be more informative. Their approach could be used to design vaccines that target vulnerable regions of the proteins, potentially blocking viral escape and evasion. However, they acknowledge that there are limitations to their method and more validation and optimization of their predictions is needed before they can be used in vaccine development.
The paper proposes a method called Dynamic Signatures Generated by Regulatory Networks (DSGRN) to efficiently analyze the global dynamics of regulatory networks. It can identify phenomena like resettable bistability and hysteresis, which are important for understanding how a cell's behavior changes in response to different inputs. DSGRN models a regulatory network as a directed graph with nodes representing genes or proteins and edges representing interactions between them. It decomposes the parameter space into regions based on the threshold values of the interactions between nodes. It then constructs a Morse graph for each node in the graph, which encodes the dynamics of the node. The Morse graphs allow the algorithm to identify regions of parameter space that exhibit resettable bistability or hysteresis. DSGRN can efficiently compute the prevalence of these phenomena by searching for paths in the parameter graph that exhibit these behaviors. The paper demonstrates the approach on a synthetic toggle switch and the E2F-Rb restriction point network, which exhibits resettable bistability and hysteresis. It shows that DSGRN can efficiently identify these phenomena for larger regulatory networks, while other approaches struggle due to the large parameter space. The results suggest that the robustness of these phenomena may be an emergent property of the entire network, rather than just the subnetworks studied in isolation. The method has the potential to directly probe the dynamics of larger networks, providing new insights into complex cellular behavior.
The paper describes how a type of protein called cyclophilins can regulate the replication of certain viruses, specifically tombus viruses. Cyclophilins are proteins that can isomerize peptide bonds, which helps proteins fold and transport them. They were found to interact with the viral replication proteins of tombus viruses and in yeast. The cyclophilin Cpr7p was found to be the strongest inhibitor of tombus virus replication, and it interacted with a specific region on the p3 protein. The interaction inhibited the recruitment of the virus RNA to the membrane where replication occurs and the assembly of the replication complex. This inhibition was seen in vitro and in yeast cells. The paper suggests that cyclophilins may be a common way that hosts regulate viral replication, and that the inhibition of cyclophilin activity by viruses may be one mechanism they use to replicate. The study also found that cyclophilins from plants can also inhibit the replication of certain viruses.
The paper describes an analysis of gene expression patterns in the conceptus (the extraembryonic tissue that forms the developing embryo) and the endometrium (the lining tissue of the uterus) in cattle at the stage of implantation (gestation day 18). The study found that many genes expressed in the conceptus are also expressed in the endometrium, suggesting a coordinated response between the two tissues. The endometrium responds to the conceptus by changing its gene expression to allow implantation. This coordinated response is important for successful implantation and pregnancy. The study identified genes that are highly coexpressed between the conceptus and endometrium, showing that the endometrium adapts to the conceptus. The genes coexpressed between the two tissues are involved in processes such as chromatin remodeling, gene transcription, RNA processing, and oxidation reduction. The findings suggest that the endometrium is able to elicit a fine-tuned response to the conceptus and this coordinated interaction is important for normal pregnancies. The study provides insights into the molecular interactions between the conceptus and endometrium and could inform the development of techniques to improve pregnancy rates in artificial reproductive technologies.
The paper discusses how reliably measuring a "clean face" in children can help prevent the spread of trachoma, a leading cause of blindness. The authors found that trained Tanzanian staff from different educational backgrounds were able to reliably assess clean faces in children. Intra-observer agreement between graders was good, with some variation driven by differences in assessing nasal discharge. Inter-observer agreement between graders was also good, with the senior grader showing better agreement. The study suggests that training is the most important aspect for assessing clean faces, not the level of education. However, the assessment of clean faces was found to be less reliable when nasal discharge was common, which was high due to the season. The study demonstrates that with proper training and assessment, the reliability of clean face assessment can be improved. The authors recommend including assessing clean faces in surveys for trachoma control programs to help monitor efforts to reduce transmission.
The paper describes a genome-wide system to study non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) between natural repeats in budding yeast. The authors exploited the dispersed and divergent families of retrotransposons called Ty1 and Ty2 in S. cerevisiae to study NAHR. They found that DSBs within long stretches of unique sequences can activate Ty recipients 12-48 kb distal from the break site to recombine with non-allelic donor sequences, resulting in NAHR through break-distal recombination. The authors showed that the intrachromosomal position of Ty donors is preferred 50-fold over interchromosomal donors for NAHR. NAHR through break-distal recombination is robust, even though AHR occurs more frequently in purebred diploids. DSBs that occur outside repeat clusters are more mutagenic than those inside repeat clusters. The authors found that Ty1/Ty2 elements are activated as recipients when they become single-stranded, allowing break-distal sequences to compete with break-proximal sequences. The SSA pathway is the dominant NAHR pathway, even when DSBs occur in unique sequences. The study provides insights into the parameters that control NAHR between natural repeats, including the preference for intrachromosomal donors, the role of sequence homology and genomic position, and the competition between NAHR pathways. The results challenge current models that assume DSBs inside repeats determine NAHR outcomes and highlight the importance of considering the genomic context of the break.
The paper investigates how the Abd-A Hox factor regulates the Epidermal Growth Factor signaling pathway to promote the formation of hepatocyte-like cells (oenocytes) in Drosophila embryos. Abd-A is found to directly regulate the transcription factor PntP1 by activating its expression. This potentiates the EGF signal, allowing more cells to differentiate into oenocytes. The PntP1 transcription factor is activated in oenocyte precursors through both direct Abd-A/Hox complex binding and EGF signaling. However, Abd-A also likely regulates additional genes in oenocyte precursors beyond PntP1, as the expression of PntP1 in thoracic segments is less efficient compared to abdominal segments that express Abd-A. The study suggests that Abd-A and Pnt factors physically interact and integrate to regulate target genes in the oenocyte regulatory network, but the exact mechanisms are not yet known. The findings provide new insights into how Hox and EGF signaling pathways intersect and how Abd-A contributes to oenocyte specification. The study also highlights the complex regulation of oenocyte development, showing that multiple genes are required beyond just PntP1 and Abd-A.
The paper describes a novel framework for tracking and analyzing multiple fruit flies in a video, as well as a machine learning approach to classify social interactions between them. The framework uses a graph-based approach to track individual flies accurately, even when they are in close proximity to each other. The machine learning approach is able to classify interactions between flies as different types, such as "head-tail touches". The authors use this pipeline to study the effects of social isolation on the social networks of male fruit flies, finding that while the global network structure remains relatively unchanged, individual flies show increased locomotor activity and interactions within the group. The isolation also leads to changes in gene expression, including increased lipid metabolism. The findings suggest that social isolation can have early-occurring behavioral and physiological effects on fruit flies, which may be important for understanding the development of social behavior.
The paper discusses the differences in immune responses between two forms of onchocerciasis, generalized (GEO) and hyperreactive (HO) infections. The study found that people with HO infections have a more dominant Th17/Th2 response profile compared to those with GEO infections. This is evident from higher levels of IL-5 and IL-3 cytokines and an upregulation of genes related to Th17 responses. The Th17 response appears to be linked to a failure to produce IFN-gamma and IL-10. The Th2 response is also upregulated in HO infections. The study suggests that the increased Th17/Th2 balance may contribute to the development of hyperreactive onchocerciasis and that Th17 cells may be responsible for inducing microfilaria death, which in turn leads to a Th17 response. The findings suggest that Th2 cytokines may play a protective role in milder forms of onchocercias. However, the study also shows that the Th17/Treg balance is shifted in favor of Th17 responses in HO infections. The results differ from previous studies on schistosomiasis and filariasis where Th1 and Th2 responses were found to be linked to different clinical manifestations.
The paper describes a new computational method called SIEVE that can identify proteins that are secreted by the type III secretion system in bacteria. The method uses sequence analysis and machine learning algorithms to identify the secretion signal in the N-terminal region of proteins that are secreted through the type III secretion system. The authors trained SIEVE on known secreted effectors from two bacteria, Salmonella Typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and then used it to predict secreted effectors in Chlamydia trachomatis, a bacteria that is difficult to study due to its obligate intracellular lifestyle and lack of genetic manipulation. The results show that SIEVE can accurately identify known secreted effectors from both organisms and also predict novel secreted effectors in Chlamydia trachomatis. The method uses a combination of sequence features such as GC content, evolutionary conservation, phylogenetic profile, and specific amino acid biases in the N-terminal region of the protein to identify the secretion signal. The authors found that the N-terminal region of secreted effectors contains a conserved sequence bias that is shared between organisms, indicating that there is a common targeting mechanism for the type III secretion system. The predicted secreted effectors in Chlamydia trachomatis are consistent with known secretion signals in other bacteria and provide valuable insight into the nature of the targeting mechanism. The method has the potential to identify novel secreted effectors in other pathogenic bacteria and inform the development of antibacterial drugs.
The paper discusses how platelets guide leukocytes to the site of inflammation. Inflammation causes platelets to immediately adhere to endothelial cells in small blood vessels, which in turn enables neutrophils and immune monocytes to arrest and extravasate from those same sites. Platelets adhere to endothelial cells by activating integrins on their surface, which then induces changes in integrin conformation that promotes the immune cell extravasation. Platelet adhesion to endothelial cells is required for the recruitment of neutrophils and monocytes to the site of inflammation. Platelet-directed guidance of leukocytes to specific sites of extravasation increases the efficacy of immune cell recruitment and is a promising therapeutic target for inflammatory conditions.
The paper discusses a new mouse model that lacks the protein CEP164, which is important for the formation of motile cilia in airways, oviducts, and testes. The loss of CEP164 leads to a severe reduction in the number of motile cilia in these tissues, including ependymal cilia, airway cilia, and ovulatory cilia. The loss of cilia is observed from embryonic development onwards and results in developmental defects such as holoprosencephaly, cardiac looping defects, and hydrocephalus. The loss of fertility in males is also observed. The study demonstrates that CEP164 plays a key role in the formation of ciliary vesicles and basal body docking, which are important steps in the formation of motile cilia. The authors propose that CEP164 functions in the selective transport of certain vesicles with distinct cargo into the ciliary compartment, and that its loss leads to a reduction in the levels of Rab1 and Rab8, which are involved in ciliary trafficking. The mouse model will provide a valuable tool to study the mechanisms of ciliogenesis and how defective cilia contribute to chronic respiratory diseases such as cystic fibrosis and asthma.
This paper investigates the phenomenon of protein aggregation that occurs in normal aging in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. The authors find that many proteins become more insoluble and prone to aggregation with age, suggesting that the aging process itself may promote protein misfolding and aggregation. They identify over 1000 proteins that become more insoluble with age and show that the aggregation propensity is associated with specific amino acid residues and increased β-sheet propensity. They find that reducing insulin/IGF-1 signaling, which extends lifespan, also reduces protein aggregation. They also observe that many of the aggregation-prone proteins are involved in maintaining proteostasis, including chaperones and the proteasome. The authors suggest that the aggregation of some proteins may contribute to the aging process by reducing the cell's capacity for proteostasis and triggering a vicious cycle that leads to further protein misfolding and aggregation. They also find that the aggregation of certain proteins may influence disease-related protein aggregation. Overall, their results suggest that the aging process may play a role in the development of protein aggregation and that reducing protein aggregation could be a potential therapeutic target for age-related diseases.
The paper discusses how Salmonella enterica subspecies Typhimurium, a common food-borne pathogen, targets certain cells in the gut during in order to infect. The authors found that the pathogen's ability to invade intestinal cells is due to its ability to move in 3 dimensions and swim along the gut surface. They analyzed the initial interactions between the pathogen and host cells and found that the pathogen's movement along the surface allows it to stop at topological features like rounded cells and membrane ruffles, which facilitates its targeting of those sites. This is due to physical forces from the pathogen's flagella-driven motility, rather than chemotaxis. The authors propose that the pathogen's ability to stop at these features allows it to increase its local concentration on the host surface and increase the probability of adhesion and binding, leading to targeting of rounded cells and cooperative invasion. The paper suggests that this mechanism may be a general principle for targeting by flagellated bacteria and could be a basis for understanding how other flagellated pathogens target specific cells.
The paper discusses how prions, which are misfolded proteins that cause fatal neurodegenerative diseases, can be transmitted through aerosols. The authors exposed mice to prion aerosols generated from brain homogenates and found that the aerosol exposure time, not the immune system, primarily determined the transmission efficiency. The prions were found to directly enter the mouse brains through the olfactory epithelium and olfactory nerves, bypassing the lymphoid organs. This novel pathway of transmission through the olfactory system was observed in mice of different genetic backgrounds and was independent of the adaptive immune system and germinal centers. The results suggest that exposure to aerosols may pose a previously unappreciated risk for laboratory personnel handling prion-infected materials.
The paper describes a study on the proteolytic enzymes in the parasitic nematode Angiostrongylus costarensis. The researchers aimed to identify and characterize the proteases present in adult and larval stages of the worm using gel-based approaches and multiplex substrate profiling by mass spectrometry. They found that adult worms have one or more aspartic acid peptidases that are active at acidic pH and are inhibited by pepstatin, while at least one enzyme with di-carboxypeptidase activity is present in female worms. These aspartic peptidases preferentially cleave peptides with hydrophobic amino acids at the P1 position. They also found that cysteine peptidases are active in both male and female worms at acidic pH, and show a preference for basic amino acids at the P1 position. Serine peptidases and metallopeptidases are also present in both worm stages, with different specificities. The study identified proteases that are active in larval stages and confirmed that hemoglobin hydrolysis by A. costaricensis requires aspartic peptidases. The results provide new insights into the biology and pathogenesis of the nematode and suggest that proteolytic enzymes may play key roles in its nutrition and other physiological processes.
The paper discusses the discovery of a new mechanism by which the fungus Aspergillus fumigus protects itself from its own toxic molecule, gliotoxin. Gliotoxin is produced by the fungus and can be toxic to cells inside and outside of the fungus. The researchers found that a gene called gliT is responsible for protecting the fungus from gliotoxin. When the gliT gene is deleted, the fungus is highly sensitive to gliotoxin and cannot grow in its presence. They also found that the fungus can express the gliT gene in response to gliotoxin exposure, suggesting that gliT plays a key role in regulating the effects of gliotoxin within the fungus. The authors propose that gliT is part of an auto-protective mechanism that protects the fungus from its own toxicity. They also show that the gene can be used as a new selection marker for transforming fungi to produce fungal proteins for industrial applications. The study demonstrates a new mechanism by which fungi protect themselves from their own toxins and has potential applications in biotechnology.
This paper examines the relationship between the genetic variation in the prion protein at residue 129 and the resulting Prion disease phenotype. The paper finds that while the genetic variation at residue 129 does not directly affect the relative abundance of the two Prion strains, Prion Scrapie-Methionine (M129) and Prion Scrapie-Valine (V129), the genotype at residue 129 does influence the Prion strain that initiates the disease. The study shows that Prion Scrapie-Methionine is more likely to result in the MM1 strain while Prion Scrapie-Valine is more likely to result in the MV2 strain. However, in heterogeneous cases of Creutzfeldt-Jak disease, the relative abundance of the two Prion strains is not clearly linked to the disease phenotype. The study suggests that factors other than the Prion strain, such as host factors and other forms of abnormal Prion that may not be equivalently infectious, may influence disease onset and progression. The findings provide insight into the relative tendency of Prion Scrapie-Methionine and Prion Scrapie-Valine to spontaneously adopt the Prion conformation. The results also suggest that the genetic variation at residue 129 may be used to trace back the prion strain that initiated infection in patients.
This study investigated the risk and protective factors associated with early childhood developmental outcomes in a low-income population in South Africa. The study found that boys consistently performed worse than girls on developmental assessments, with lower raw scores across cognitive, language, and fine motor domains and increased risk of developmental delay in any one of these domains. Key protective factors included higher maternal education, higher birth weight, and socioeconomic status. However, the interaction between sex and birth weight was complex, with boys showing increased vulnerability at lower weights but better scores at higher weights. The study suggests that boys may be particularly sensitive to environmental exposures and maternal anemia had the strongest interaction with developmental outcomes. The findings highlight the importance of supporting young women to attend and remain in school and the caregiver-child relationship in supporting developmental outcomes. Factors associated with increased risk of developmental delay included physical health issues, maternal depression, and exposure to violence within the home. The study emphasizes the need for early childhood interventions that target nurturing care, health, nutrition, and safety to mitigate the risks and promote resilience in this critical age group.
This paper investigates the patterns of allelic expression (ASE) for rare deleterious and loss-of-function coding variants found through exome sequencing across multiple somatic tissues. The researchers used both RNA-seq and mmPCR-seq to measure allelic expression across multiple tissues and found that while gene expression alone is not sufficient to predict the exposure of a damaging allele, allelic expression patterns show a high degree of variability across tissues. They identified 40 genes that exhibited different patterns of ASE across multiple tissues, including 114 that had no ASE, 111 that exhibited shared ASE across tissues, and 111 that exhibited variable ASE. They found that rare nonsense alleles showed characteristic and consistently lower expression across multiple tissues, suggesting they are efficiently degraded through nonsense-mediated decay. This suggests that incorporating transcriptome data can enhance the interpretation of pathogenic protein-coding variants by providing insight into their patterns of ASE. The results highlight the importance of testing multiple tissues to better understand the impact of these variants within an individual.
The paper discusses how the fungus Candida albicans can survive and adapt to long-term activation of its stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) Hog1. The SAPK Hog1 is activated when the phosphorylation protein Ypd1 is lost. The study shows that cells lacking Ypd1 can survive long-term activation of Hog1 by activating other SAPK regulators, such as PTP2 and PTP3. This allows cells to reduce the level of phosphorylated Hog1 and maintain viability. Infection with Candida cells lacking Ypd1 actually increases the virulence of the fungus, as it can kill macrophages more effectively. The results suggest that inhibiting the Ypd1 protein in Candida infection could enhance the virulence of this major fungal pathogen. However, the study also highlights that the ability of Candida to survive long-term Hog1 activation may be specific to this fungus and may not be applicable to other fungi, as the stress responses and signaling pathways are different. The study concludes that inhibiting Ypd1, which is a target of interest as an antifungal drug, may not be as effective as previously thought.
The paper describes how a poxvirus called Myxoma virus encodes a protein called M01L that can inhibit both inflammasome activation and NF-κB signaling pathways, leading to rapid induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines. When the M01L protein is expressed in cells, it interacts with the host protein ASC-1, which regulates inflammasome activation, and with NF-κB protein p105, which regulates NF-κB signaling. The M01L protein blocks the degradation of NF-κB p105, preventing its translocation to the nucleus and activation of NF-κB signaling. This results in rapid induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6 and MCP-1, which are regulated by NF-κB. The study shows that the M01L protein can interact directly with both host ASC-1 and NF-κB p105, indicating it acts as a co-repressor of both pathways. The M01L protein is also found to inhibit the activation of NF-κB p65, another key regulator of NF-κB signaling. The study suggests that the M01L protein's ability to inhibit both inflammasome and NF-κB pathways simultaneously is an important mechanism for the virus to dampen early immune responses to in vivo, allowing it to more efficiently infect cells.
The paper describes a new method for identifying three species of tapeworms (Echinocococcus granulosus, Echinococcus multilularis, and Echinoccus shiquicus) in dog feces and intestines. The traditional method of identifying these tapeworms involves microscopic examination of eggs, but this can be difficult and time-consuming. The new method uses a multiplex PCR technique that amplifies DNA from the tapeworms in a single tube, allowing for faster and more accurate identification. The researchers developed specific primers that target the mitochondrial genes of the three species and found that the method was highly specific and could detect infections up to 17 days earlier than traditional methods. The method was tested using samples from dogs in China where the tapeworms are known to be endemic and found to be effective at identifying infections. The researchers believe this method will be useful for surveillance and monitoring control programs to prevent echinococcosis transmission, particularly in areas where the tapeworms infect both humans and dogs.
The paper proposes a new statistical method called FarmCPU to improve the power and control false positives in Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS). The method uses two parts: a fixed effect model (FEM) and a random effect model (REM) that are iteratively applied to test genetic markers and pseudo quantitative trait nucleotides (QTNs) as covariates. The FEM tests each marker one at a time using QTNs as covariates to control false positives, while the REM optimizes the selection of QTNs based on their testing statistics. The REM also uses a substitution process to identify the most significant QTN for each marker. This allows for efficient computation and control of confounding between markers and QTNs. The method was tested on simulated and real datasets and showed improved power and control compared to other GWAS methods. It identified new associated loci and confirmed known associations. The method can also handle complex traits with population structure and non-genetic effects, and is computationally efficient.
The paper investigates how the scabies mite, Sarcoptes scabiei, helps Staphylococococcus aureus bacteria infect the skin and evade the host immune system. The scabies mite secretes a protein called SMSB4 that inhibits the host's complement system, preventing the immune system from activating and killing the bacteria. The study shows that both the classical and alternative complement pathways are activated by Staphylococococcus aureus, while the mannose-binding lectin pathway is not important. The scabies mite protein SMSB4 inhibits the formation of complement components such as C3 convertases and C5 convertases, which reduces the amount of opsonins and phagocytosis, allowing the bacteria to survive in the host's blood. The authors propose that the mite's complement inhibitors accumulate in the confined microenvironment of the epidermal burrows and gut, allowing the bacteria to evade the host's immune system. They suggest that the collective effects of multiple mite proteins and bacterial inhibitors may promote the survival of bacteria in the mite-infested skin microenvironment. This link between mite-produced complement inhibitors and bacterial survival could have implications for developing alternative therapies for scabies.
The paper describes the structure and function of a novel type of toxin-antitoxin pair called MqsR:MqsA. MqsR is a small protein that is toxic and forms a complex with its antitoxin MqsA, which inhibits MqsR activity. MqsR is a member of the RelE/YoeB family of ribonucleases and functions as a ribosome-dependent RNase. The MqsR:MqsA complex associates with MqsR and regulates the expression of critical E. coli genes. The authors determined the structure of MqsR and MqsA using X-ray crystallography and biochemical analysis. They found that MqsA is a zinc-binding domain that binds DNA through its C-terminal domain, while MqsR binds DNA through its N-terminal domain. The MqsR:MqsA complex is a dimer of dimers, with MqsA forming the center. MqsA binds DNA through a unique helix, while MqsR binds DNA through its entire structure. The structure of MqsR provides insight into how this novel toxin-antitoxin pair functions and how it may contribute to bacterial persistence and biofilm formation. The findings provide a basis for developing new antibiotics that target TA pairs.
The paper discusses the potential of using liposomes as a vaccine delivery system in combination with a TLR4 ligand (MPL-TDM) to improve the efficacy of a recombinant protein vaccine against Leishmania donovani in susceptible mice. The authors found that liposomes alone or in combination with MPL-TDM during priming and boosting resulted in significantly higher immune responses compared to liposomes alone, including higher DTH and IgG2a responses. This led to reduced parasite burden in the liver and spleen after challenge with L. donovani. They conclude that the combination of liposomes and MPL-TDM is a novel approach for designing effective vaccines, particularly for subunit protein-based vaccines against Leishmania infection. The results suggest that the use of liposomes and MPL-TDM together could improve the immune response and provide protection against experimental visceral leishmaniasis.
The paper discusses how the protein Sfi1 plays a role in the regulation of centrosome duplication in yeast cells. The researchers found that Sfi1 is phosphorylated by the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk1 during the G1 phase of the cell cycle, which inhibits the process of centrosome duplication. When Cdk1 activity is reduced or depleted, Sfi1 is no longer phosphorylated, allowing for the centrosomes to duplicate once per cell cycle. The phosphorylation of Sfi1 by Cdk1 also blocks the process of centrosome separation. The researchers propose that Cdk1 phosphorylation of Sfi1 is required for centrosome separation and that dephosphorylation of Sfi1 by the protein Cdc14 at the end of the cell cycle licenses the centrosomes for duplication in the next G1 phase. They found that cells with reduced Cdk1 activity exhibit premature centrosome duplication, indicating that Sfi1 phosphorylation by Cdk1 is required for proper centrosome separation. They also showed that inducing Cdk1 activity in mitotically arrested cells leads to reduplicated centrosomes, supporting the idea that Cdk1 phosphorylation of Sfi1 blocks centrosome duplication. This study provides insight into the mechanism that initiates centrosome duplication and suggests that the same mechanism may be important in other organisms, including humans.
The paper discusses how plants control their final organ size, focusing on leaves. It explains that meristemoid cells, which have stem-like activity, play a key role in determining leaf size. Previous studies have shown that two proteins called PPD1 and PPD2 restrict meristemoid cell proliferation. The authors identify two new targets of SAP, a protein called STERILE APETAL (STERILE APETAL), which was previously shown to promote meristemoid cell proliferation by degrading PPD1 and PPD2. SAP interacts directly with KIX8 and KIX9, two proteins that form a repressor complex with PPD, and modulates their stability. They find that SAP targets the KIX-PPD complex for degradation, which in turn controls the expression of genes related to cell proliferation and growth. They show that SAP functions in a common pathway with KIX8 and KIX9 to control meristemoid cell proliferation and organ size. The paper also shows that SAP interacts with and degrades other proteins besides PPD1 and KIX8/9, suggesting that it may target additional substrates. The findings suggest that the SAP-KIX-PPD complex may be a conserved mechanism in different plant species that could be manipulated to increase seed and organ size in crops, which is important for agricultural yield.
The paper describes a study that aimed to identify and isolate the types of Leptospira bacteria that cause leptospirosis in Tanzania. The researchers found that different types of Leptospira bacteria infect different animal species, including cattle, pigs, dogs, goats, rodents, fish, and humans. The most common types of Leptospira found in Tanzania were serovars Sokoine and Kenya, which were able to be identified using serological tests. The study found that using these local serovars in serological tests led to higher prevalence of leptospirosis compared to using reference serovars. This suggests that using local serovars in serodiagnosis could help diagnose leptospirosis in Africa where the disease is more common and widespread. The researchers argue that more studies are needed to isolate and identify Leptospira from a wider range of animal species to better understand the distribution of the bacteria and improve diagnosis. This could help raise awareness of the disease among healthcare workers and the public and improve diagnosis and treatment.
This paper investigates the role of beta-human papillomavirus (beta-HPV) in skin cancer. The authors create transgenic mice that express beta-HPV E6 and E7 genes in the basal layer of the skin, which is where the virus typically infects and initiates cancer. They find that these mice have a much higher susceptibility to developing skin cancers when exposed to chemical carcinogens or chronic UV radiation compared to mice that express the genes in the superficial layers. The authors propose that the beta-HPV genes bypass cellular defense mechanisms that normally prevent DNA damage, allowing the accumulation of mutations and transformation. The results suggest that beta-HPV infection may play a role in the early stages of skin cancer development, potentially leading to cancer through chronic UV irradiation. The differences in the susceptibility of the two transgenic mouse models suggest that the expression level of the genes in the basal layer is an important factor.
This paper describes a new method for identifying driver mutations in cancer cells based on an evolutionary model of tumorigenesis. The model assumes that mutations occur randomly in a population of cells and that some mutations confer a random fitness advantage, while others do not. The method calculates the probability that a particular mutation is present in a significant fraction of the final tumor population, based on the fitness of the cells in the tumor and the sensitivity of the sequencing method. The paper applies this method to colorectal cancer data and identifies 43 genes as potential drivers. The key idea is that most mutations occur before cancer initiation and the timing of cancer initiation is random and correlated with the process of mutation accumulation. The method is sensitive to some model parameters but shows robust predictions overall. The paper demonstrates the potential of using evolutionary models to extract biological information from genomic sequencing data.
The paper discusses the role of the Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) 5 and 6 protein complex in meiotic sister-chromid recombination in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. The authors generated mutants lacking the SMC-5 and SMC-6 genes and found that these mutants had defects in homologous recombination repair of programmed double-strand breaks in meiosis. Specifically, the mutants had increased DNA damage response and chromosome fragmentation, indicating that the SMC-5/6 complex is required for homologous recombination in meiosis. The authors propose that the SMC-5/6 complex functions in a homolog-independent manner in meiosis, which may be important for genomic stability in germ cells. The study provides evidence that proper execution of homolog-independent recombination is crucial for genomic stability in germ cells, and suggests that loss of chromatid cohesion near the site of homolog-independent repair may account for the appearance of chromosome fragments. The findings suggest that C. elegans may be a useful model for studying mechanisms involved in homolog-independent repair during meiosis, which may be used in other species to maintain genomic integrity during meiosis.
The paper investigated the relationship between childhood obesity and the development of type 1 diabetes. The researchers used a genetic association study design called instrumental variable (MR) to test if childhood obesity increases the risk of developing type 1 diabetes. They used genetic variants associated with childhood body mass index (BMI) as an instrumental variable to test if obesity increased the risk of type 1 diabetes. They found that genetic variants associated with higher BMI were associated with a 32-45% increase in the risk of developing type 1 diabetes. The study supports the idea that childhood obesity may play a role in the development of type 1 diabetes, though the researchers acknowledge that the genetic instrument assumptions were not fully testable. The findings suggest that reducing body weight in early life may help prevent type 1 diabetes from developing. The study provides some evidence that childhood obesity may contribute to type 1 diabetes, but the results need to be confirmed in a larger study to rule out chance findings.
This paper describes an analysis of chromatin structure and dynamics in the human immune cell line K56. The researchers used ChIP-seq and MRT data to identify four main chromatin states in the human genome, each with distinct epigenetic marks and gene expression profiles. They found that these states correspond to early and late replication times in S-phase, with early replication occurring in active chromatin and late replication occurring in repressed chromatin. The early replication states are characterized by high GC content and high expression levels, while the late replication states are characterized by low GC content and low expression. The researchers found that these chromatin states are spatially organized along the chromosomes, with early replication states being confined to regions near replication origins, and late replication states being more spread out. They propose that the organization of these chromatin states along the chromosomes is likely to play a key role in the spatio-temporal control of replication and gene expression. The findings provide new insights into how chromatin structure and dynamics coordinate with replication timing and gene expression in mammalian genomes.
The paper discusses a model called the beam-film model for how recombination interactions occur stochastically at different positions along different chromosomes, but COs tend to be evenly spaced. The authors propose that this phenomenon implies the existence of communication along chromosomes. They propose a model where mechanical stress relief along chromosomes plays a role in CO patterning. They simulate the CO patterning process using the beam-film model and show that it can accurately explain experimental CO data sets from yeast, tomato, and Drosophila. The simulations reveal that the existence of non-interfering COs, CO homeostasis, and the obligatory CO can be explained by the model. The authors argue that the beam-film model provides a useful way of thinking about CO patterning and that the logic of the model supports the idea that CO patterning is mediated by communication along chromosomes.
This paper describes a new way to genetically manipulate Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite that causes Chagas disease, in order to study its biology and pathogenesis in vivo. The researchers developed a method to generate parasites that express both a bioluminescent and fluorescent protein. This allows them to detect and track individual parasites within infected tissue sections, even when the parasite burden is very low, which was previously difficult to do. This will help them study how the parasite interacts with the host and how it evades the immune system. They also incorporated a CRISPR/Cas9 system into the parasite to make genome editing more efficient and scalable. They demonstrated that this system works by deleting a gene and tagging proteins within the parasite. This will allow them to study the parasite's virulence, drug resistance and interactions with the host in more detail, potentially reducing the number of animals needed for experiments.
This paper investigates the role of the N-terminal domain of the protein pUL31 in the herpesvirus protein pUL31 during nuclear egress. The N-terminal domain contains a bipartite nuclear localization signal that mediates nuclear import of pUL31. However, it is found that pUL31ΔN cannot interact with pUL34 in the cytoplasm, preventing premature association. pUL31 is targeted to the nucleus independently of pUL34, but pUL31ΔN interacts with pUL34 in the nucleus. The N-terminal domain is required for translocation of nucleocapsids from the nucleoplasm to the nuclear envelope. The N-terminal domain of pUL31 contains basic patches that mediate this process, which is delayed for pUL31-hmp1mp2 compared to pUL31. This suggests that the N-terminal domain of pUL3 provides a mechanism to prevent premature association of pUL34 and pUL31, and is critical for modulating the interaction between them. This allows pUL31 to target nucleocapsids and contribute to genome packaging and primary envelopment of capsids. The N-terminal domain of pUL3 may also play a role in regulating the conformational changes in pUL31 that allow interaction with pUL34. The study provides insights into the complex sequence of events during nuclear egress of herpesviruses and lays the groundwork for identifying proteins involved in this process.
The paper discusses how a species of fruit fly called Drosophila sechellia evolved to specialize in feeding on a toxic plant called Morinda citrifolia. The researchers identified genes that are responsible for the fly's ability to detect and avoid the plant's toxicity. They found that the fly's ability to prefer the plant's odor is controlled by a gene called Obp57e, which is different between the fly species. They used genetic techniques to knockout the Obp57e gene in Drosophila melanaster and found that the resulting flies preferred Morinda's odor, indicating that this gene is responsible for the fly's specialization. However, they also found that the knockout flies had different behavioral responses to other odorants, suggesting that the Obp5d gene may also play a role. The researchers propose that the fly's ability to specialize in Morinda citrifolia likely arose from a single mutation that resulted in the loss of its ability to avoid the plant's toxicity. This mutation likely occurred before the fly's preference for the plant's odor, as the flies would still be able to detect and respond to the odor but not be harmed by the toxicity. The study provides insight into how genetic changes can drive specialization in species.
This paper investigates the entry mechanisms of the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis into human cells. The authors use live cell imaging and biochemical assays to study the early events of Chlamydia entry and identify key factors involved in the process. They find that filopodia formation is a key early event during Chlamydia entry and filopodia-EB association is required for entry. They identify a macropinocytosis-like pathway that shares similarities with viral entry mechanisms. The macropinocytosis pathway involves the Rho GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42, the N-WASP nucleation-promoting factor, and the Arp2/3 complex. The study reveals a functional relationship between the SNX9 protein and early filopodial capture. The authors also identify roles for the actin nucleator Cdc42 and the Arp2/3 complex in Chlamydia entry, and show that filopodia formation is impaired in SNX9-deficient cells. Overall, the study provides new insights into the mechanisms of Chlamydia entry and how it hijacks host cellular functions to enter cells.
The paper discusses how the enzyme poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) can modulate the metastatic progression of melanoma cells. PARP1 inhibitors have shown promise as anti-cancer drugs, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. The authors investigate how PARP1 regulates endothelial cell dynamics and endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT). They find that PARP1 inhibition in endothelial cells reduces vimentin expression, which is a key marker of EndoMT. Vimentin down-regulation prevents endothelial cells from transitioning to mesenchymal cells and acquiring a mesenchymal phenotype. This inhibition also reduces tumor cell migration and angiogenesis. PARP1 inhibition also reduces tumor microvasculature density and EMT markers in tumors, leading to reduced metastatic progression. The study suggests that PARP1 inhibition may act through its ability to regulate vimentin expression, which in turn affects upstream regulators of EMT. The authors propose that PARP1 may modulate endothelial plasticity and metastatic progression through multiple mechanisms, including vimentin expression. Understanding these mechanisms could help develop PARP1 inhibitors as anti-cancer drugs.
This paper summarizes the results of a systematic review of studies that looked at the risks of stillbirth and neonatal death in pregnancies at term. The review found that the risk of stillbirth increases steadily with gestational age, with a 64% increase in stillbirth risk from 37 weeks to 42 weeks. The risk of stillbirth was found to be higher for Black women compared to White women at all gestational ages. The risk of neonatal death did not change significantly between 38 and 41 weeks gestation, but increased beyond that. The findings suggest that the recommendation of inducing labor at 40 weeks to avoid stillbirth may not be optimal for all women, as the risk of stillbirth is higher when pregnancies continue to 41 weeks. The study highlights the need for better stratification of low-risk pregnancies and individualized prediction models to avoid unnecessary deliveries. While the findings are robust, they are limited by the heterogeneity in the definition of low-risk pregnancies and lack of data on confounding variables.
The paper discusses the mechanism by which cells in the ascidian notochord, a simple chordate, elongate during embryonic development. The notochord cells elongate along the anterior-posterior axis of the embryo without dividing. The authors found that the actin and myosin filaments that form the contractile ring at the equator, similar to those in cytokinesis, are involved in this elongation. They observed that equatorial actin filaments are enriched at the equator and are dynamic, while myosin activity is also present. The contractile ring is formed through dynamic cortical actin flow and the recruitment of actin and myosin filaments to the equator. The authors suggest that the equatorial actin ring contributes to the elongation by creating a circumferential force that is converted to a longitudinal pushing force along the cell's poles. They propose that this mechanism is a general solution for anisotropic shape change in biological systems, allowing cells to elongate along a single file without dividing.
The paper describes a method to integrate gene expression data with flux data in order to identify which enzymes are transcriptionally regulated, which are regulated post-transcriptionally, and which are metabolically regulated. The method uses a statistical approach to transform limited flux data into a genome-scale set of statistical scores similar to gene expression data. By comparing these scores with gene expression data, enzymes can be classified into the three categories. The method was applied to yeast data to identify enzymes that are transcriptionally regulated, those that show a significant change in expression but no change in flux, and those that show a significant change in flux but no change in expression. The results showed that many enzymes were transcriptionally regulated, while few were post-transcriptionally regulated. The method can be used to guide metabolic engineering by identifying enzymes that are most likely to be influenced by gene expression changes, and therefore good targets for overexpression or downregulation. The results suggest that metabolism has evolved to contain a few transcription factors that can be targeted for redirecting fluxes. The method provides more realistic flux standard deviations than previous methods and can be used to identify enzymes that are likely to be influenced by gene expression changes, but not detected by flux measurements alone.
This paper investigated the relationship between genetic and environmental factors in determining gene expression in Moroccan Amazigh people. The authors collected peripheral blood samples from three distinct Amazigh populations: nomads, villagers, and urban dwellers. They found that while genetic differentiation between the populations was relatively low, environmental factors such as lifestyle and geography had a significant impact on gene expression, with different expression profiles between the populations. They identified key genes involved in immune response and disease susceptibility that were differentially expressed between the populations. The authors suggest that diseases in urban populations may have different underlying genetic factors than those in traditional societies, and that gene expression profiling alongside genetic association studies could be useful for predicting disease susceptibility. The study highlights the impact of transitions from traditional to modern lifestyles on human immune function and disease susceptibility.
This paper analyzed a dataset of 526 genes that are specific to metazoans (animals, including humans) but are also conserved across many metazoan species. The authors found that these genes tend to be less essential than genes that are conserved across all eukaryotes and have more diverse expression patterns. They identified a core set of 10% of these genes that are highly conserved across many metazoan species, including genes involved in neuron development and function, touch sensation, and microtubule regulation. They used the nematode worm C. elegans to study the function of one such gene, tubulin folding cofactor E-like (TBCEL/coel-1), which was found to regulate microtubule stability in developing neurons. The study suggests that TBCEL/coel-1 binds and disassembles tubulin heterodimers and is a microtubule destabilizing factor, which helps regulate microtubule stability and neurite outgrowth. The authors propose that metazoan genes evolved as partially redundant modifiers of existing cellular processes, modifying these processes in specific cells to create novel functions in a multicellular context. They found that TBCEL/coel-1 has a microtubule destabilizing effect that is more pronounced when overexpressed. The study provides evidence that microtubule regulation is an important aspect of metazoan evolution.
The paper discusses how researchers used deep sequencing to study the evolution of rabies virus in a recent outbreak in northern California. They analyzed DNA from 40 samples of rabid foxes and skunks collected during the outbreak, including samples from 2003 and 2009-2010. They found that the outbreak strain was able to be transmitted by both skunks and foxes, with little genetic difference between the two. The skunk-to-fox transmission was likely the source of the outbreak. The researchers identified several genetic changes that occurred in the outbreak strain that may have helped it jump from skunks to foxes, including an unusual sequence in the G protein. They suggest that analysis of rare variants within the virus population may help identify ancestral haplotypes that could be selected for in the future if environmental conditions change. Overall, the study suggests that the outbreak strain evolved through transmission from skunks to foxes and not from a single spillover event from a skunk.
This paper describes the discovery of two new chromatin effectors in Arabidopsis that regulate flowering time. The authors found that two proteins, MRG1 and MRG2, bind to histone tails that are methylated at lysine 36 and lysine 3, specifically. They found that MRG1 and MRG2 physically interact with the transcription factor CO and the FT gene promoter to activate FT transcription. The authors showed that MRG1 and MRG2 depend on each other for their binding to the FT promoter, and that MRG2 binding to histones is essential for its biological function. The study provides evidence that MRG1 and MRG2 are novel chromatin effectors that interact with CO and the FT promoter, linking histone methylation to CO-dependent flowering regulation. This work suggests a new mechanism for regulation of flowering time in plants, where histone modifications are linked to CO binding to the FT promoter. The study also highlights the importance of the interaction between MRG1/MRG2 and CO to stabilize CO recruitment at the FT locus, which is critical for flowering transition. The authors propose that FT expression is regulated by the association of CO with MRG1/MRG2, and that this association may help re-establish the association of CO with the FT promoter after light-induced depletion. Further studies are needed to understand how FT expression is rhythmically regulated and how MRG1/MRG2 act downstream of CO to activate FT transcription.
This paper uses genomic data from 40 species to investigate why there is little correlation between the size of a population and the amount of genetic diversity within that population. The paper finds that species with larger populations have less genetic diversity compared to their size, which is known as Lewontin's paradox. The authors argue that natural selection is the main reason for this paradoxical relationship. They use statistical models to estimate the impact of natural selection on genetic diversity and find that species with larger populations have a stronger correlation between genetic diversity and recombination rate. This suggests that natural selection reduces genetic diversity more in species with larger populations. The authors also find that species with more evidence of natural selection have larger geographic ranges and smaller sizes, which supports their conclusion that natural selection plays a disproportionate role in shaping genetic diversity in species with larger populations. Overall, the paper provides evidence that natural selection plays a dominant role in shaping genetic diversity in species with larger populations.
The paper discusses the identification of two cholesterol transport proteins in the protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica called EhNPC1 and EhNPC2. These proteins are hypothesized to transport cholesterol into the cell from the outside world, which is essential for the parasite's virulence and motility. The authors found that EhNPC1 and EhNPC2 proteins interact with cholesterol and each other, and are localized in different cellular regions. The proteins are thought to transport cholesterol from the plasma membrane to the endosomes and lysosomes, where it is used for various cellular functions. The study suggests that EhNPC1 transports cholesterol to EhNPC2, which then carries it to other organelles. Experiments showed that silencing the genes for EhNPC1 and EhNPC2 reduced the parasite's ability to take in cholesterol and perform phagocytosis, indicating their importance in these processes. The study provides evidence that the "hand-off" model, where EhNPC1 transports cholesterol to EhNPC2, may be applicable in Entamoeba histolytica.
The paper discusses how the loss of the protein Survival Motor Neuron 1 (SMN) leads to developmental defects and disease in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. SMN is highly expressed in immature cells and low levels are required for proper stem cell function. In the larval CNS and testes, SMN protein levels decrease as cells differentiate into neurons and sperm. When SMN levels are reduced, stem cells have reduced proliferation and differentiate abnormally. In the larval CNS, SMN-deficient cells have defects in Miranda localization and snRNP levels. In the testes, SMN-deficient germline stem cells lose their stem cells. Overexpression of SMN leads to premature differentiation and a tumor-like phenotype. The study suggests that the level of SMN required for stem cell function is higher than the amount required for neuronal development. The results suggest that the loss of SMN protein in tissues, particularly in stem cells, may contribute to the selectivity of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) disease, which typically affects motor neurons but also has broader symptoms. The Drosophila CNS and germline system offer tractable models to study the role of SMN in development and stem cell biology.
The paper describes a survey of triatomines (kissing bugs) in Loja Province, Ecuador. The survey found that 35% of households were infested with triatomines and 3.6% of people tested had antibodies against Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite that causes Chagas disease. The most common triatomine species found was Rhodnius ecuadori, which was found in 59% of infested households. The survey showed that factors such as keeping pigs, poor sanitation, and accumulation of fruit trees were associated with triatomine infestation. The survey also found that the species Rhodnius ecuadori and Triatoma carrioni were more likely to be found in the peridomicile (around the house) than the domicile (inside the house). Higher infestation rates of Trypanosoma cruzi were found in the domicile than peridomicile, suggesting transmission is occurring in the region. The study suggests that vector control interventions in the region are ineffective and more comprehensive surveillance and community education are needed to monitor and control triatomine populations. The findings suggest that transmission of Chagas disease is actively occurring in the region and a systematic, sustained and monitored vector control program that addresses the social and economic factors that contribute to substandard housing would be beneficial.
The paper discusses the role of the immune system in Chikungunya virus infection and disease in mice. The authors used mice that were genetically deficient in T and B cells (RAG1-/-) to study the role of the adaptive immune response in controlling the virus. They found that while T cells are involved in footpad swelling, they are not the sole cause of the disease. The adaptive immune response is necessary for complete viral clearance, but not for the development of acute footpad swelling. The kidney is a common target for persistent virus infection, which is often detected by histopathology but not by viremia. The authors conclude that the adaptive immune system plays a role in controlling persistent Chikungunya virus infection but does not prevent acute disease or tissue damage. Their findings suggest that the live-attenuated vaccine candidate, CHIKV/IRES, is safe for immunodeficient individuals, as it does not persist in mice lacking T and B cells. The study provides insights into the immunopathogenesis of Chikungunya virus and its potential treatment in individuals with compromised immune systems.
This paper explores the role of DNA methylation in plant development and how naturally occurring methylation differences between genes can influence seed phenotypes. The authors investigate the case study of a gene called HDG3, which is imprinted in the endosperm, meaning that the paternal allele is expressed more than the maternal allele. They show that naturally occurring methylation differences between HDG3 alleles in Arabidopsis accessions can explain the imprinting variation between accessions. They demonstrate that they can introduce a methylated HDG3 allele into an endosperm that was previously hypomethylated by transforming a Cvi allele with an inverted repeat containing the methylated 5' region of the HDG3 gene. This methylated allele is then expressed in the endosperm, switching the gene from a non-imprinted, repressed state to an imprinted, more active state. The resulting seeds have earlier endosperm cellularization and are smaller, indicating that the hypomethylation of the Cvi allele is important for Cvi-directed developmental programs. The results suggest that naturally occurring epialleles, or differences in DNA methylation between genes, can contribute to seed developmental adaptations and phenotypic differences between accessions.
According to this paper, the authors found that loss of a gene called Fhit leads to genome instability in cells. They discovered that loss of Fhit expression causes cells to accumulate DNA breaks and chromosomal abnormalities, which can lead to cancer. They found that this occurs because Fhit helps synthesize DNA thymidine, which is a key component of DNA. When Fhit is lost, the cells lack thymidine and cannot properly complete DNA synthesis, leading to replication stress and genome instability. The authors propose that this mechanism of genome instability occurs early in cancer development, before oncogene activation. Loss of Fhit provides a selective advantage that allows cancer cells to acquire genetic mutations and become cancerous. The paper provides evidence for this model through experiments showing that mice lacking Fhit become immortalized and accumulate DNA abnormalities, and human cancer cells that lose Fhit are more prone to cancer. The findings suggest that loss of Fhit is a common underlying initiator of genome instability that can lead to cancer.
This paper describes the identification and characterization of a novel lectin called CCL2 from the mushroom Coprinus cinerea that specifically binds to a trisaccharide containing fucose on the core of N-glycans in in in invertebrate glycans. The lectin has a high affinity for this epitope and recognizes it via a unique binding site on its β-trefoil fold that is different from typical β-trefoil lectins. CCL2 is monovalent and does not cluster glycans on cell surfaces, yet it is still toxic to invertebrates like nematodes and insects. The authors propose that the high affinity of the single binding site of CCL2 compensates for its lack of multivalency, allowing it to act through a novel toxicity mechanism that does not involve clustering. This toxicity may involve interfering with cellular signaling pathways or damaging membranes. The paper also shows that CCL2 can be used for differential glycan profiling and diagnostics of parasitic infections.
The paper investigates the large-scale distribution of de novo mutations (DNs) in humans. It uses data from 3 studies that discovered over 13000 DNs to analyze the variation in the mutation rate across different scales. The results show that there is significant variation in the mutation rate at different scales, but most of this variation can be explained by variation in the mutation rate at the larger scale. The variation in the mutation rate is not strongly correlated to genomic variables such as GC content or DNA methylation marks. The correlation between divergence between humans and chimpanzees and the mutation rate is weaker than expected, suggesting that the mutation rate evolves relatively rapidly. The paper finds that much of the variation in diversity at the 1MB scale is due to variation in the mutation rate. However, the correlation between diversity and mutation rate is weak, suggesting that much of the variation in diversity is due to linked selection. The paper also finds that the slope of the relationship between mutation rate and divergence rate is consistent with the hypothesis that biased gene conversion affects the mutation rate.
The paper describes a theoretical framework for understanding how the activity of neurons in a network of neurons is correlated. The framework uses linear response theory to approximate the response of individual neurons and then iteratively build approximations to the correlation between neurons. The approach shows how the correlation structure of the network depends on the response properties of individual neurons and the network architecture, including the strength of connections between them. The authors demonstrate that the framework works well for networks of integrate-and-fire neurons and can be used to predict correlations in networks with different levels of inhibition and excitation. They show that local connections between neurons contribute to correlations in balanced networks, while strengthening inhibition can lead to increased synchrony. The framework also allows for calculating correlations in random networks, providing a tractable yet accurate description of joint spiking statistics. The approach is viewed as a valuable tool for understanding the origin and impact of correlated activity in neuronal populations and for inferring network architecture from correlations.
This paper describes a study that aimed to understand the entry process of hepatitis C virus (HCV) into hepatocytes. The researchers used a combination of siRNA screening and single particle tracking to identify cellular factors involved in HCV entry. They found that HCV entry requires the engagement of CD81 receptor and claudin-1/occludin receptors on the cell surface, followed by internalization into clathrin-coated pits. The virus then associates with clathrin light chain and E3 ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl, and is sorted into early endosomes. The early endosome is enriched with Rab5a, which is necessary for HCV uncoating. The virus then fuses out of the endosome and enters the cytosol. The researchers observed that HCV particles move along actin stress fibers and nucleate actin around clathrin pits during internalization, which they suggest is similar to the entry process of other viruses. They found that HCV does not require tight junctions for entry, but the tight junction protein claudin-1 is localized to cell surface regions outside of tight junctions. The study suggests that HCV has evolved a complex series of receptor interactions to promote cell-cell spread of the virus, rather than cell-cell infection. The findings could inform HCV therapeutic development and may help identify cellular targets for small molecule inhibitors.
This paper analyzed the financial and economic costs of eliminating and eradicating lymphatic filariasis (LF) through mass drug administration (MDA) in endemic countries. The authors used a micro-costing approach to estimate the costs based on the number of people at-risk, country-specific growth rates, duration of MDA, historical progress, and previous investments. They found that faster rates of MDA scale-up resulted in lower costs. They estimated the total financial investment to eliminate LF at around $929 million and eradicate it at around $1.29 billion. The costs of eradication ranged from $7.5 billion to $8.0 billion, with about half due to the value of donated drugs. The authors noted that accelerating eradication could be cost-saving in the short-term, but the costs of maintaining momentum and achieving certification of eradication were important. They also found that including vector control and morbidity management could increase costs. The study highlighted that while the cost of eliminating LF is lower than eradicating it, the long-term benefits of eradication make it worth pursuing. However, eradication requires political will, community ownership and feasibility.
The paper discusses how environmental conditions, specifically water availability, can influence the strength of mutualistic interactions between plants and animals, like ants and their host plants. The researchers studied the mutualism between Cordia alliodora trees and the ant Azteca pittieri in 26 sites across Mesoamerica, covering a precipitation gradient from 200 mm/yr to 10000 mm/yr. They found that the strength of the mutualism, as measured by the number of ant colonies, colony size, and ant defense, increased with water stress and decreased precipitation. The researchers propose that water stress causes carbon starvation in the trees, which in turn leads them to invest more carbon in their ant defenders, like the ants. This investment in ant colonies is seen as a way to reduce the risk of extreme herbivory. The results suggest that the risk of herbivory, rather than the cost of ant colonies to the trees, drives the strength of the mutualism, and that water availability mediates the relationship between plant and ant traits. The findings suggest that environmental extremes, like drought, may play a role in shaping plant-animal mutualisms and that the evolution of mutualistic strategies may be influenced by abiotic variables.
This paper investigates how the protein Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1) associates with chromatin in Drosophila. The paper argues that HP1 associates with chromatin independently of the Argonaute 2 (AGO2) and Piwi proteins, which are involved in RNA silencing pathways that establish heterochromatin. The paper shows that AGO2 and Piwi mutations result in increased silencing of transcriptional reporters and an increase in HP1 association with piRNA clusters, suggesting that HP1 can associate with chromatin independently of these RNA silencing pathways. Chromatin immunoprecipation (ChIP) experiments also show that HP1 associates with piRNA clusters at levels above euchromatic sites. However, loss of piRNA production at a single piRNA locus results in expansion of HP1 at the centromere, suggesting that HP1 can independently nucleate heterochromatin. The conclusion is that HP1 can associate with chromatin independently of the endo-siRNA and piRNA pathways.
This paper describes a study on the pharmacokinetics of Praziquantel (PZQ), the only drug available for treating opisthorchiasis, a liver fluke infection caused by Opisthorchi viverrini. The study compared the concentrations of the drug's enantiomers and metabolites in blood, plasma and dried blood spots (DBS) from 9 opisthorchias patients treated with 3 oral doses of 25mg/kg PZQ. The results showed that: 1) The racemic PZQ was more quickly eliminated than the enantiomeric PZQ, with a shorter half-life of 1.1 vs 3.3 h. 2) The enantiomer concentrations were generally higher in plasma than in blood and DBS. 3) The metabolite R-trans-4-OH had higher concentrations in blood and DBS than the parent enantiomers. 4) Higher concentrations of R-PZQ and S-PZQ were observed in patient 2 who had co-infections with whipworms and hookworms, and possibly liver pathology. The study found that dried blood spots was a valid alternative to plasma sampling for measuring PZQ concentrations and that the metabolite R-trans-4-OH had a higher affinity for red blood cells than its parent molecule. The results suggest that PZQ is highly protein-bound and red blood cells may dilute its concentrations. Further studies are needed to investigate the PK/PD relationship and the role of R-trans-4-OH in the drug's activity.
The paper describes how researchers used a conditional degron system to reduce the expression of two enzymes involved in the synthesis of nucleotide sugars called UDP-Glc and UDP-Gal in the Leishmania parasite. They found that reducing the expression of one of these enzymes to a low level was sufficient to slow down the parasite's growth and cause cell death, indicating that these sugars are essential for the parasite's in vitro growth. The researchers conclude that targeting these enzymes could be a potential strategy for developing drugs against Leishmania, but they also acknowledge that the exact pathway(s) that require these sugars and the extent to which they are essential for parasite survival remain to be determined. They propose that the UDP-Glc/UDP-Gal sugars may be used as targets, but inhibition of the salvage pathway mediated by the other enzyme could also be challenging. Further studies are needed to better understand the role of these sugars in Leishmania and identify specific drugs that target them.
The paper discusses how the infectivity and PrPSc aggregation state of different prion strains from the same species can vary, but the most infectious prion strains tend to have smaller, more oligomeric PrPSc aggregates. They used a technique called sedimentation velocity (SV) to analyze the PrPSc and infectivity of different prion strains. They found that regardless of the prion strain, the most infectious prion aggregates sedimented in the middle of the gradient, not the top. However, when they analyzed the PrPSc and infectivity at equilibrium using sedimentation equilibrium (SE), they found that the most infectious prion fractions had similar density profiles. They also found that the most infectious prion fractions had higher templating activity using protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) assays. They conclude that the size of the PrPSc aggregates, not their density, is the main factor determining the infectivity and strain specificity of the prion.
This paper investigated the potential of using miR-101 as a therapeutic strategy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). They found that systemic delivery of miR-101 via lentivirus in an orthotopic liver implanted HCC mouse model significantly inhibited HCC growth and metastasis, leading to longer survival times and fewer metastases. They identified ROCK2 as a new target of miR-101, in addition to previously known targets like EZH2 and COX2. The study suggests that miR-101 works by suppressing multiple targets and inhibiting the RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway, leading to a "one-hit/multiple-targets" mechanism. The results provide a basis for further exploring the functions and mechanisms of miR-101 in HCC and establishes the concept of systemic miRNA delivery via lentivirus as a viable anti-HCC therapeutic strategy.
The paper describes a new method for isolating and characterizing different types of hematopoietic progenitor cells in the fetal liver. The authors used a mouse model with a Runx1-P1-GFP::P2-hCD4 reporter to identify and isolate immunophenotypic megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors (MEPs) and common myeloid progenitors (CMPs. They found that a subfraction of the CD5+ CD150+ MEPs and CD5+ CD150+ CMPs are enriched for megakaryocyte-erythroid potential, while another subfraction is enriched for granulocyte/monocyte-restricted cells. They identified CD31 as a marker that correlates with the pro-megakaryote and immunophenotypic CMP compartments. The authors showed that CD31 expression inversely correlates with the CD150 marker, with CD31low CMPs being more pro-erythroid and CD31high CMPs being more granulocyte/monocyte-restricted. The authors demonstrated that the CD5+ CD150+ MEPs are a rare population that can give rise to CD5-CD150+ CMPs and CD5+ CD150+ MEPs, but CD5-CD150+ CMPs are not. They also showed that the CD31low CMPs are enriched for immunophenotypic CMPs. The Runx1-P2-hCD4 expression in CD31low CMPs indicates a block in erythroid differentiation. They analyzed the expression of key regulators of hematopoiesis and found that the CD31low CMPs have a distinct gene expression profile compared to CD3high CMPs. They also showed that deleting the Runx1C isoform in fetal liver mice results in a differentiation block in the CD31low CMPs. Overall, the study demonstrates the benefits of isolating highly purified myeloid progenitors to analyze lineage specification and maturation in the fetal liver.
This paper describes the implementation of a case-area targeted response (CATI) strategy to control cholera outbreaks in Haiti. The strategy involved rapidly responding to suspected cholera cases and neighboring households with targeted interventions such as decontamination, education, and water chlorination. A nationwide alert-response system was launched to coordinate the response. The study found that response exhaustiveness, intensity and quality of CATIs increased over the four year period of the study, with 75% of alerts receiving a response in the same week during the last semester. However, response was initially insufficient and heterogeneous between different communes and NGOs. The strategy proved feasible at an annual cost of less than $1 USD per inhabitant. The study suggests that a buffer period was needed to establish coordination and commitment, but response was not significantly hampered by distance from the affected commune. Response was prioritized for more severe outbreaks, targeting red alerts more than orange alerts. The strategy proved to be effective in controlling cholera incidence, but more work is needed to evaluate the impact of the interventions.
The paper describes an animal model of post-treatment control of HIV infection in Rhesus macaques. Rhesus macaques were infected with a moderately pathogenic strain of HIV called SIVsmFTq and then treated with the latency reversing drug RMD. The researchers found that RMD could effectively increase viral expression in the post-treatment controls, but did not have a significant impact on the total number of CD4+ T cells. They also found that RMD could reactivate latent virus in the reservoir, leading to a rapid rebound of plasma virus following cessation of antiretroviral therapy. However, the viral rebound was not due to a loss of immune cell function, but rather due to the drug's ability to activate resting cells. The researchers conclude that RMD may be a useful approach for reactivating the latent virus and potentially reducing the reservoir, but further studies are needed to assess its efficacy in reducing the reservoir.
The paper discusses how single-cell gene expression analysis can be used to study cell differentiation and cell-to-cell variability. The authors analyzed gene expression patterns in individual cells during chicken T2EC cells differentiating from self-renewal to erythrocytes. They found that gene expression variability increased significantly between 8-24 hours, indicating a critical point of no return in the differentiation process. This increase in variability preceded changes in cell size and correlations among genes, which indicated a phase transition. The authors identified genes that may act as early sensors of change and showed that cell size variability peaked at 48 hours before dropping at 72 hours. The increase in gene expression variability at 8-24 hours preceded the irreversible commitment to differentiation, which was confirmed experimentally. The results suggest that the initial gene expression waves represent an early signal, the DNB genes a pre-transition signal, and the final surge in cell size variability the point of differentiation. The authors propose that the increase in gene expression variability reflects a reconfiguration of the gene expression network into a state compatible with differentiation conditions. The authors argue that continuous gene expression data would be needed to fully understand the actual process of differentiation.
The paper discusses how the bacteria Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, which causes gastroenteritis in humans and asymptomatic infection in poultry, uses a complex system of genes called Salmonella pathogenicity islands (SPIs) to become virulent. The SPIs are encoded on the bacterial chromosome and contain genes required for the bacteria to invade epithelial cells and produce virulence factors. The authors found that two specific genes called GreA and GreB, which are part of a family of genes called Gre factors, are required for the bacteria to produce the effector proteins encoded by the SPIs. The Gre factors prevent backtracking of RNA polymerase complexes during transcription, which helps to regulate the expression of the SPI genes. The authors showed that the Gre factors are required for the bacteria to produce the effector proteins and invade epithelial cells. They found that Gre factors specifically regulate the gene hilD, a key regulator of the SPI genes, by preventing transcriptional pauses during transcription. The hilD gene has a regulatory motif in its 3' untranslated region that allows it to be downregulated by Gre factors. The study suggests that the Gre factors play a key role in regulating the expression of the SPI genes and are required for the bacteria to be virulent.
This paper describes the genome sequence and physiology of a microbe called H. arsenicoydans that can live in environments with high levels of arsenic. The microbe is found to be able to oxidize arsenic into its less toxic form, which it can then use as an energy source. It also has mechanisms to sense and respond to arsenic levels, including a positive chemotactic response to the metal. The microbe has multiple pathways to accommodate different oxygen concentrations and has genes to scavenge arsenic, including an As[III] oxidase and an As[V] reducer. It also has genes to repair arsenic damage to its DNA and protect against oxidative stress. The microbe is able to grow in environments with high levels of other toxic metals, including cadmium and zinc. The genome of H. arsenicoydans is found to be unique compared to related species, containing genomic islands containing genes for arsenic resistance and metabolism. The microbe's ability to scavenge arsenic and use it as an energy source may play a key role in colonizing arsenic-rich environments and bioremediation of contaminated sites. The findings suggest that microbes living in extreme environments have evolved multiple mechanisms beyond oxidation reactions to adapt to their conditions, including sensing and responding to to to toxic elements like arsenic.
The paper discusses how different types of fatty acids found in the blood of pregnant women, particularly phospholipid fatty acids, may be associated with the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The researchers measured the levels of 118 different fatty acids in the blood of 2802 pregnant women over the course of pregnancy, including n-3 and n-6 fatty acids. They found that women who developed GDM had lower levels of certain n-3 fatty acids (e.g. DHA and EPA) and higher levels of certain n-6 fatty acids (e.g. LA and DGLA) compared to women who did not develop GDM. The fatty acid ratios also showed different patterns, with n-6 fatty acids showing a positive association with GDM risk and n-3 fatty acids showing an inverse association. The researchers conclude that the associations between individual fatty acids and GDM risk may be due to the different biosynthesis pathways and metabolic effects of each type. They suggest that considering the different effects of individual fatty acids, rather than just dietary intake, may provide insights into prevention strategies to mitigate GDM risk.
The paper discusses how latent HIV reservoirs in long-lived CD4+ T cells can impact the evolution of the virus within infected individuals and at the population level. The authors develop a mathematical model that shows that a latent reservoir can cause a significant delay in the within-host evolutionary process of HIV, potentially leading to intermediate levels of virulence that optimize transmission. This is because the reservoir acts as an "ancestral" repository of past viral strains that can be reactivated months or years after infection, providing a source of ancestral variants that can influence within-host evolution. The model shows that the delay in within-host evolution depends on factors like the relative size of the reservoir compared to the number of actively infected cells, the replication rate of the virus, and the activation rate of latently infected cells. The model predicts that a relatively large latent reservoir can lead to a significant delay in within-host evolution, potentially explaining why some individuals maintain very low plasma HIV levels and have slower evolution. The study highlights the importance of considering latent HIV reservoirs in understanding how the virus evolves within and between hosts.
The paper describes the identification and characterization of a new protein called SmInAct, which is a TGF-β ligand in the parasitic flatworm Schistosoma mansoni. This protein is expressed in adult Schistosoma mansoni and in eggs, and is required for egg development. The authors found that SmInAct expression is diminished in infertile females, indicating that it is transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally regulated by the opposite sex and by signals from the host. They showed that knocking down SmInAct expression in Schistosoma mansoni females using RNA interference resulted in a complete cessation of egg development, while SmInAct protein was undetectable in infertile females. They also showed that eggs produced by SmInAct-knocked-down females failed to develop. The study highlights the potential of SmInAct as a key factor in regulating embryogenesis in Schistosoma mansoni and suggests that this protein could be a target for controlling Schistosoma mansoni infection.
The paper discusses the discovery of two distinct compartments within the centrosome of Toxoplasma gondii parasites that are responsible for different cellular functions. The outer compartment, which contains proteins like TgCentrin1 and TgSfi1, is involved in regulating the budding cycle, while the inner compartment, containing proteins like TgCEP250 and TgCEP25-L1, is involved in cytokinesis. The two compartments are separated by a structural barrier and are oriented in a specific way with respect to the nucleus and daughter cells. The loss of the outer compartment leads to abnormal budding, while the loss of the inner compartment causes an increase in the number of centrosomes and abnormal mitosis. The study suggests that the two compartments are regulated independently and that different mechanisms control their duplication. This discovery may help explain how Toxoplasma parasites can adapt to different hosts and tissues and achieve their complex life cycles.
The paper discusses the mechanism of how two response regulators, BldM and WhiI, control the development of Streptomyces filaments. The response regulators are activated by different signaling pathways, σWhiG and σBldN, and they interact to form a heterodimer that controls the expression of genes required for filament development. The BldM-WhiI heterodimer is found to be responsible for activating certain genes that are required for the later stages of development, while the BldM homodimer activates genes required for the earlier stages. The authors use a variety of techniques like ChIP-seq, microarray analysis, and protein expression of heterodimeric forms of BldM and WhiI to show that the BldM-WhiI heterodimer is responsible for the activation of certain genes that are required for the late stages of development, while the BldM homodimer activates genes required for the earlier stages. The findings suggest that heterodimerization of response regulators can provide a new mechanism for expanding the signaling capabilities of bacteria.
The paper examines the level of knowledge and practices of the community regarding Yellow Fever in two districts in South Omo Zone, Ethiopia where there have been repeated outbreaks of the disease. The study found that most community members had low levels of knowledge regarding the mode of transmission of Yellow Fever, believing it can be transmitted through breathing rather than mosquito bites. Only about 40% of participants correctly identified that Yellow Fever is transmitted through mosquito bites. Most participants considered Yellow Fever a preventable disease and vaccination as the main preventive method. However, some participants complained they did not receive adequate information about the specific vaccine they received during a recent outbreak, which may affect their attitudes towards the vaccine. The study suggests that providing clear information on the vaccine and its role in prevention is important to increase vaccination coverage. The study highlights the need for strategies to improve community knowledge and practices regarding the cause, transmission and prevention of Yellow Fever, beyond just promoting vaccination.
The study used mice to investigate how the live-attenuated yellow fever vaccine strain 17D-204 induces immunity against yellow fever virus (YFV) infection. The researchers found that both neutralizing antibodies and CD4+ T cells elicited by the vaccine could provide protection against a virulent YF virus challenge. CD4+ T cells were found to be functional during the early and late time points following vaccination and produced IFNγ, TNFα and IL-2, while CD8+ T cells were not protective against disease. However, CD4+ T cells were found to contribute to survival following challenge, suggesting they may play a role in controlling virus replication. The study suggests that neutralizing antibodies may be required for sterilizing immunity, but CD4+ T cells may also help limit the spread of virus reservoirs. The results provide insights into the immune mechanisms that contribute to the long-lasting protection conferred by the 17D-based vaccines, which could inform the development of other vaccines.
This study aimed to determine the incidence of human cysticercosis, a neglected zoonotic disease caused by the larval stage of the tapeworm Taenia solium, in an endemic area in Zambia. The researchers conducted a community-based longitudinal study over three sampling rounds, collecting blood and stool samples from participants. They found that 38% of the participants tested positive for cysticercal antibodies, indicating exposure to the parasite, while only 19% tested positive for tapeworm eggs in their stool. The study showed that the majority of participants became infected within a year of the first sampling round, with a significant increase in antibody responses over time. However, many participants remained negative throughout the study period, indicating that only a minority of infections fully established. The study suggests that antibody responses do not necessarily indicate a well-established infection and that some participants may have had a transient exposure with low antigen levels. The seroreversion rates were higher among younger participants, indicating that the immune system may clear the infection more effectively in younger people. The estimated incidence of cysticercosis based on antibody responses was 630 per 100000 persons, comparable to previous studies in other regions.
The paper discusses how the number of immunological genes (MHC genes) that present pathogen-derived oligopeptides to T-cells, called pathogen-derived peptides, evolves in response to high parasite richness. The authors found that while high parasite richness selects for expansion of MHC genes, it is unlikely to explain large interspecific differences in the number of MHC genes. Instead, the number of MHC genes can be modulated by the rate at which parasites evolve and the strength of mechanisms that counteract high numbers of copies in the genome. For example, high parasite richness may lead to increased evolution of MHC genes in some species, while lower parasite richness may allow maintenance of high individual MHC diversity in others. The authors used computer simulations to model interactions between MHC genes and antigens produced by parasites, and found that high parasite mutation rate and low parasite richness can lead to higher individual MHC diversity, while high parasite richness alone does not consistently lead to higher individual MHC diversity. The study suggests that interspecific differences in MHC gene number may be due to differences in the mechanisms that counteract MHC gene expansion.
This paper discusses a method to estimate the amount of genetic variation that can be explained by genetic variants in a population, known as genetic heritability, using genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data. The method uses all genetic variants tested in a GWAS, rather than just testing each variant individually. This can provide a more accurate estimate of heritability than traditional methods that test each variant individually. The paper derives mathematical expressions to estimate the sampling variance of genetic heritability and genetic correlations between traits, which can be used to calculate statistical power to detect genetic variants. The authors show through simulations that their derived expressions accurately match the observed standard errors from real genotype data and are consistent with published studies. The authors also provide an online calculator to estimate power based on the estimated variance and population parameter values. The key takeaway is that the more samples used in a GWAS, the more accurate the estimate of genetic heritability and genetic correlations will be, with a quadratic increase in power with sample size.
The paper describes how the receptor protein of the anthrax bacterium Anthraxin toxin can act as a molecular switch to initiate cellular entry. Anthraxin toxin is composed of three plasmid-encoded polypeptides that bind to specific cell surface receptors. When the receptor binds to the PA63 form of anthraxin, it triggers a conversion of the anthraxin toxin into a pore-like structure. The receptor protein remains bound to the anthraxin pore after the pore is formed, but contacts with the PA2 domain are lost. The receptor protein may influence the structure and function of the pore complex. The paper uses NMR spectroscopy to monitor the interactions between the anthraxin receptor protein and the anthraxin pore. The results show that the receptor protein remains bound to the pore domain after the pore is formed and that certain chemical shifts in the anthraxin pore are consistent with the receptor influencing the structure of the pore. This supports the idea that the receptor may act as a molecular switch to control the anthraxin pore.
The paper summarizes the results of a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies on the yield of atrial fibrillation screening in people aged 65 and older. The studies found that the detection rate of new atrial fibrillation through screening increases with age, with the highest detection rate for people aged 70-74 years. 14% of new atrial fibrillation cases identified through screening were eligible for oral anticoagulation (OAC) treatment. The yield of new atrial fibrillation and stroke risk are sensitive to age, so the number needed to screen (NNS) to identify one treatable case depends on the age distribution of the population to be screened. Screening for atrial fibrillation in people aged 65 years is likely to be cost-effective if started at this age in line with current guidelines, but actual cost-effectiveness depends on the age distribution of the population and the proportion of new cases that would benefit from OAC treatment. However, actual cost-effectiveness calculations would need to take into account the potential increased bleeding risk from OAC treatment. The authors conclude that screening for atrial fibrillation in a general population is likely to be cost-effective if started at age 65, but the best age cutoff depends on the age distribution of the population and the actual yield of new cases.
The paper describes how the protein HLA-E (an inhibitory protein) plays a role in protecting against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) infection in mice. HLA-E restricts T cells and helps regulate their activity. HLA-E is less polymorphic than HLA-A, making it a promising target for TB vaccine development. The study found that mice lacking the HLA-E protein (Qa-1) were more susceptible to TB infection and had higher bacterial burdens. Qa-1-deficient mice had increased activated T cells with inhibitory surface markers, leading to increased T cell death and inability to control bacterial burden. This suggests that HLA-E restricts T cells through both CD94/NKG2A inhibitory receptors and CD8+ Tregs. The study used genetically modified mice with different HLA-E mutations to determine that both mechanisms are involved in protective immunity. The results provide insight into how HLA-E helps protects against TB infection and may inform future vaccine development.
This paper investigated how plant viruses evolve within individual plants by modeling their dynamics within the plant tissue. Using high-throughput sequencing, they found that plant viruses go through bottlenecks during colonization, leading to genetic drift and selection. The bottlenecks are likely due to the small size of the virus populations, which limits the fixation of advantageous mutations. They observed that within-host drift and selection occur simultaneously and jointly shape the evolutionary dynamics of the viruses. They found that natural selection favors the fittest variants, while genetic drift can lead to random fluctuations in virus frequencies. They used mathematical models to infer the selection process between competing variants and the intensity of drift experienced by the viruses. They found that the viruses experience bottlenecks during colonization of the plant tissues, which affect their population dynamics. The study provides insights into how plant viruses emerge and evolve within hosts and how to design control strategies to prevent virus emergence.
This paper investigates a mechanism by which a bacterial pathogen, Staphylocococcus lugdunensis, can adapt to its environment and overcome nutrient limitations by amplifying a gene called isd. This gene allows the bacteria to acquire heme as a source of iron, which is scarce in the human body. The study found that this amplification of the isd gene leads to increased expression of proteins on the cell surface that can bind heme, providing a growth advantage to the bacteria when competing for limited amounts of heme. This advantage is only apparent when the bacteria are in direct competition for heme. The researchers found that the amplification of the isd gene leads to a growth disadvantage when there is an excess of heme available, likely due to heme's toxicity. The study suggests that gene duplications like this are an evolutionary adaptation that can provide an advantage under selective pressure, but will be lost when selective pressure is removed. This mechanism is specific to the Staphylocococcus lugdunensis species and has implications for understanding how bacteria adapt to the human body.
The paper describes how two different strains of Wolbachia bacteria, wAu and wRi, have spread through populations of Drosophila simulans in eastern Australia over the past two decades. The researchers used PCR and DNA sequencing to determine the infection status of individual flies and the strain of Wolbachia. They found that wRi, which induces little or no reproductive manipulation, has spread rapidly from three locations in eastern Australia, displacing the wAu strain that induces little or no CI. The wRi strain seems to increase fitness in nature, which allows it to spread even when very rare. The wRi infection increased from low frequencies in the 1990s to high frequencies by 20012, and now occurs at high frequencies throughout eastern Australia and Tasmania. The wAu strain persists at high frequencies in some areas but has not spread to Western Australia. The researchers conclude that the wRi strain likely spread through Fisherian dynamics, where the rare infection increases fitness even at low frequencies, allowing it to spread rapidly. This is supported by the rapid spread of wRi and the lack of CI between wRi and wAu infections. The findings suggest that Wolbachia infections that do not induce reproductive manipulation may still spread through populations, and may do so in a Fisherian manner.
The paper discusses the findings of an analysis of cholera cases in the Philippines between 2008 and 2013. The analysis used data from sentinel hospitals and disease surveillance systems to determine the incidence of cholera in the country. While the actual incidence of cholera may be higher due to underreporting, the analysis found that there were 42,071 suspected and confirmed cholera cases over the six year period. Access to improved sanitation was associated with lower cholera incidence, while access to improved water sources was associated with higher cholera incidence. This suggests that breakdowns in water infrastructure may allow contamination of water sources, leading to cholera outbreaks. The findings highlight the need for better disease surveillance and improved response to cholera to minimize the morbidity and mortality associated with the disease. The paper concludes that the results provide valuable information on the scope and burden of cholera in the Philippines and support the need for improved disease surveillance and cholera response policies.
The paper discusses a new gene-diet pair that controls the plasticity of aging in Caenorhabditis elegans, specifically the nematode worm. The gene FLR-4 regulates life span by preventing the activation of the p38 MAPK pathway dependent on the food type. When FLR-4 is knocked down, life span is extended, indicating that it has an adaptive capacity to different diets. The study shows that FLR-4 functions in the intestine and neurons to regulate life span. It also shows that FLR-4 uses a pathway similar to that of the DR pathway to ensure longevity, dependent on FOXA/PHA-4 but independent of the FOXO factor DAF-16. The results indicate that FLR-4 is a longevity gene that controls adaptive capacity to different food types. The study also shows that FLR-4 regulates the expression of cytoprotective genes dependent on diet through the p38 MAPK pathway. The paper concludes that understanding the mechanisms of adaptive capacity to different diets is still in its infancy and that this area of research could provide insights into how animals have evolved to maintain homeostasis in response to different diets.
The paper compares the results of text mining abstracts and full-text scientific articles from 15 million articles. They found that the full-text articles contain significantly more protein-protein, disease-gene, and protein-compartment associations that are not found in the abstracts. The full-text articles outperformed the abstracts in all benchmarked cases, except for protein-compartment associations. The authors suggest that the full-text articles contain more accurate information and that text mining of full-text articles will be more valuable for discovering novel associations. The full-text articles are also longer and contain more mentions of genes and compartments, which may be due to recent advances in biology. The authors note that the results are a lower limit due to issues with converting PDFs to text and that the performance will likely improve with more full-text articles and better text mining methods. However, they believe that full-text articles will still provide more accurate results even with millions of articles.
The paper describes an experiment where they adapted the Legionella pneumophila bacteria to grow within mouse macrophages to study how the bacteria evolves to infect humans. They found that the bacteria evolved different mutations that improved its ability to grow in macrophages compared to growing in amoebae. Some of these mutations resulted in fitness costs in the macrophage medium and amoebae, while others provided broad improvements to intracellular replication. The study suggests that cycling through diverse protozoan hosts maintains L. pneumophila as a generalist, and that environmental restriction within mammalian hosts may limit its ability to specialize for growth within mammals. The authors propose that lysine availability within amoebae limits the environmental dissemination of mammalian-adapted L. pneumophila and prevents specialization of the bacteria for growth within a mammalian niche.
The paper discusses how home-based surveys can be used to estimate the prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among adolescents and young adults in sub-Saharan Africa, where the burden of STIs is high and the majority of infections are asymptomatic. The authors conducted a study among young people aged 15-24 in a rural HDSS in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, using a home-based survey to assess STI prevalence, acceptability and feasibility. They found that 47 of 134 eligible participants enrolled and 64% of those contacted consented to participate. The survey included questions on demographics, sexual behavior, genital symptoms and testing for chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis and trichomoniasis. They found high prevalence of chlamydia among both men and women, particularly among those aged 20-24, and high prevalence of HSV-2 among women. Factors associated with STI infection included having more sexual partners and being in school or working. The study demonstrates that home-based surveys can be a feasible and acceptable way to estimate STI prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa, but there are challenges in contacting young men and underreporting of sexual behavior. The study provides evidence that population-based surveys should be complemented by surveillance in key populations, such as sex workers, to fully understand the STI burden and evaluate interventions.
This paper investigates the role of the timing of neurogenesis in the hippocampus in learning and memory. The authors used a mouse model in which they conditionally activated the expression of a gene called PC3 in progenitor cells in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. They found that premature activation of PC3 caused the differentiation of neurons, but not the total number of new neurons generated. This resulted in a significant impairment in spatial learning and memory, as the new neurons were not able to properly integrate into existing memory circuits. The authors conclude that the timing of neurogenesis, rather than the number of neurons generated, is critical for the generation of new memories. The faster maturation of new neurons may result in premature end of the developmental stages, leading to reduced synaptic transmission and impaired ability to integrate new information. The study suggests that the correct timing of neurogenesis is important for the generation of memories, and that a small number of new neurons generated at the appropriate stage may be sufficient to integrate new spatial information.
The paper proposes a model to explain how honeybees estimate their angular velocity based on visual input. The current understanding is that honeybees estimate angular velocity using neural circuits in the visual system that detect visual motion and integrate information over time. However, the neural circuits detecting visual motion have different spatial frequency sensitivity. The paper suggests that the neural circuits in the visual system are organized into columns and use different retinotopic detectors with different time delays to estimate angular velocity. These detectors are combined in a way that produces an estimate of angular velocity that is insensitive to the spatial frequency of the visual stimulus. This allows the honeybees to fly in a straight line even when the walls of a corridor have different spatial frequencies. The model uses a neural network to simulate this columnar organization of retinotopic detectors and estimate angular velocity. The model is tested against behavioral data from honeybees that shows that it can reproduce the deviation of the average flight path from the center of a corridor and the deviation of the flight path for different spatial frequencies of stimuli. The model also shows that it can be used to estimate distance traveled based on the angular velocity estimate. The model is simpler than a separate neural circuit for estimating angular velocity, which would require more neural channels and energy, and is therefore more conservative from an evolutionary perspective.
This paper describes the discovery of a new enzyme that is involved in the synthesis of galactolipids in plant chloroplasts. Galactolipids are important for the structure and function of chloroplast membranes. The enzyme, called PHD1, is encoded by a gene called Os01g03710 in rice and is found to be localized in chloroplasts. The mutation of the PHD1 gene in rice leads to a reduction of galactolipids and an accumulation of UDP-Glc and UDP-Gal in chloroplasts, which causes impaired photosynthesis and stunted growth. Overexpression of PHD1 in rice leads to increased galactolipid synthesis and improved photosynthesis and growth rate, suggesting that PHD1 plays a key role in the photosynthetic system. The results have implications for rice crop improvement and bioenergy production.
The paper discusses how the ability of organisms to respond to changes in their environment is key to their survival and reproduction. The paper focuses on the role of the insulin/IGF signaling pathway in Drosophila melanogaster. The authors found that reduced activity of the insulin signaling pathway II (IIS) and the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) can slow aging and increase resistance to stress in the fly, and that different IGFs have different functions. They generated mutants with different DILP genes and found that DILPs can act redundantly to execute their functions. DILPs are expressed in both the medullary nervous system and the fat body, with each DILP having its own spatiotemporal expression pattern. The results suggest that redundant DILPs may have evolved to help stabilize IIS and provide a rapid response to changing conditions. The authors also found that Wolbachia, a maternally transmitted bacteria, can extend lifespan in flies by increasing IIS activity. The study highlights the redundancy and synergy of DILP expression and suggests that IIS and DR may act through different mechanisms to extend lifespan in Drosophila. The study provides insights into how organisms adapt to changing environments and evolved mechanisms to regulate lifespan.
The paper describes a method to identify transcription factors that are associated with patient survival in breast cancer based on DNA methylation data. The authors analyzed DNA methylation data from primary breast tumor samples and found that certain DNA methylation patterns were associated with patient survival time. They identified transcription factors whose binding motifs were enriched in DNA regions near methylated CpGs that were also associated with patient survival. The authors proposed a model where the binding of alternative factors to unbound transcription factor binding sites may cause misregulation of downstream genes and impact patient survival. They identified several transcription factors that were enriched in survival-associated DNA methylation regions in ER- and p53- breast cancer subtypes, suggesting that the binding of these factors may be important for patient survival. They also found that DNA methylation in ERα and p53 binding sites may reflect the lack of these transcription factors rather than the methylation itself. The study provides new insights into the complex regulatory interactions between DNA methylation and transcription factors in breast cancer and suggests that identifying key transcription factors associated with patient survival could help guide cancer treatment strategies.
The paper discusses how the Polycomb group (PcG) proteins, which regulate gene expression during development and differentiation in plants, have evolved to have different specific functions. The authors studied how the different PcG proteins collaborate to regulate different genes during development in different tissues. They found that different PcG proteins have distinct functions and target different genes based on their binding to different transcription factors. They identified specific transcription factors that are associated with the H3K27me3 marks that PcG proteins leave on genes. These transcription factors seem to work together with PcG proteins to selectively regulate genes during development. The authors propose a model that different PcG proteins have different functions based on the tissue and developmental stage they are involved in. PcG proteins that are involved in earlier developmental stages target genes that are involved in more fundamental processes, while those in later stages target genes that are more recently evolved. This model provides insight into how the complex epigenetic machinery evolved to regulate developmental processes. The authors used genome-wide sequencing data to show that different PcG proteins have different functions based on the genes they target and the transcription factors they interact with.
The paper describes a new genetic linkage map of the mosquito species Aedes aegypti, which is a vector for many important viral diseases like dengue and chikungunya. The map was created by using Restricted-site Associated DNA (RAD) sequencing and placing scaffolds from the genome assembly onto chromosomes. The map shows three linkage groups that represent the three chromosomes of Ae. aegypti. The map shows that misassemblies in the genome were detected and corrected by splitting scaffolds where they were misassembled. The map places 58% of the genome onto chromosomal scaffolds, including 60% of the annotated genes. The map also shows that there is low recombination across the genome, particularly near the centromeres, which could be due to non-coding repetitive sequences accumulating in low recombination regions. The map was used to map resistance to a filarial nematode parasite called Brugia malayi to a region on the first chromosome, which was confirmed to be mediated by a sex-linked locus. The study suggests that while there are still some misassemblies in the genome, the high correlation with previous maps and the strong syntenic relationships between Ae. aegypti and Anopheles gambiae suggest that the majority of scaffolds are correctly placed. The improved genetic map will facilitate future studies on the genome organization and function of Ae. aegypti.
The paper describes a genetic analysis of how bacteria cells resist the effects of the antibiotic mecillinam. The researchers used a technique called transposon sequencing to identify genes that make bacteria resistant to mecillam. They found that some genes that make enzymes that cut cell walls, called peptidoglycan, can help bacteria resist mecillam by redirecting cell wall precursors away from the mecillam-targeted enzymes that break the cell walls. They found that enzymes called endopeptidases, which cut cell walls, can stimulate the activity of enzymes that make new cell walls, called acyl-peptidases, and help bacteria survive mecillam treatment. The endopeptidases don't need to physically interact with the acyl-peptidases to work. Instead, they may stimulate their activity by sensing cut cell walls and "filling in" where needed. This suggests that cell walls are dynamic and can be made in areas where endopeptidases and acyt-peptidases are needed. This new understanding of how cell walls are made could help researchers develop new antibiotics that can defeat bacterial resistance.
The paper explores how the release of neurotransmitter from neurons can control the gain of information transfer through neural circuits. The authors use a computational model to show how asynchronous release of neurotransmitter can modulate neuronal gain in a way that is independent of balanced input and excitation/inhibition. They find that the gain of neurons can be modulated by two different mechanisms: shunting inhibition, which reduces the slope of the input-output curve, and asynchronous release, which can either amplify or reduce the gain. They show that the gain modulation by asynchronous release depends on the level of membrane conductance, which can shift the neuron from a mean-driven to a fluctuation-driuation-driven regime. They also find that the effect of asynchronous release on neuronal gain depends on whether phasic and asynchronous releases share a common resource pool or are decoupled. They suggest that the ability to control gain through asynchronous release may be useful for neurons in early development when balanced excitation and inhibition have not yet been established.
The paper describes a new mechanism that cells use to protect against protein misfolding and aggregation, which is linked to many neurodegenerative diseases. The authors found that inhibiting two genes called ubiquitin ligase UBE4B and lysine-specific demethylase LSD1 leads to enhanced protein quality control and reduced protein misfolding and aggregation. They identified a pathway mediated by these genes that involves the transcription factor p53, which is activated when UBE4B and LSD1 are inactivated. Activating p53 leads to increased protein quality control through the proteasome and autophagy. Inhibiting UBE4B and LSD1 reduces protein misfolding and aggregation, and activating p53 leads to increased degradation of misfolded proteins. The authors propose that p53 is a "transcriptional switch" that guards against both genotoxicity and proteotoxicity by promoting repair or removal of damaged cells. Their findings suggest a potential new antiproteotoxicity therapeutic strategy that harnesses the cell's ability to reprogram protein quality control.
The paper describes a method called DynaFace that can classify protein-protein complexes as either obligatory or non-obligatory based on their dynamic behavior. The method uses a Gaussian Network Model (GNM) to calculate the correlations between fluctuations of residues in different parts of the protein structure. By analyzing the correlations across the entire structure, DynaFace can determine if the interactions are obligatory or non-obligatory. The authors tested their method on a dataset of known protein-protein complexes and found that even using only the slowest modes of fluctuations, DynaFace could correctly classify the majority of complexes as obligatory or non-obligatory. However, there are some complexes that are difficult to classify due to their large size or the similarity between the interacting chains. The authors suggest that combining DynaFace with other methods that use local sequence and structure properties could improve the accuracy of their predictions. The method provides a global perspective on the interactions between subunits in complexes, which is complementary to local features used in other methods.
This paper discusses the difference in how Candida albicans, a fungal pathogen, responds to pheromones depending on its cell type. White cells are round and give rise to flatter colonies while opaque cells are elongated and give rise to filamentous colonies. White cells are mating competent while opaque cells secrete sex-specific pheromones that induce mating responses in the opposite mating type. Pheromone signaling in white cells is mediated by Cph1, while Tec1 is the master transcription factor in opaque cells. The paper shows that Cph1 is also essential for pheromone-stimulated biofilms in white cells, while Tec1 is required in both white and opaque cells. However, the genetic requirements for pheromone-stimulated and conventional biofilms are different. Loss of the transcription factor Ndt80 results in thicker pheromone-induced biofilms. Transcriptional profiling was performed to identify genes that are specifically induced in white cells and found that Hgc1 is essential for both white and opaque cell biofilms. The results suggest that distinct cell types mediate the different phenotypes upon pheromone challenge, with white cells exhibiting weaker responses and more mating gene expression. The paper concludes that the differences in gene expression under pheromone challenge may be due to inherent structural differences between white and opaque cells.
The paper discusses how network models can be used to better understand the structure of the human brain. Researchers built 13 different types of synthetic network models to compare to empirical data from diffusion imaging. They found that models that incorporated physical constraints, like distance between nodes, were better at accurately modeling the brain network structure compared to models that did not have those constraints. This suggests that physical factors like the brain's embedding in space likely play an important role in shaping the brain's network topology. The study showed that models that simulated the brain's embedding and constraints on connection length were more similar to the empirical brain data compared to models that only simulated topological properties. The study demonstrates that models that combine topological and physical constraints, like the affinity model, are promising null models for comparing brain networks to statistical null models. The paper concludes that synthetic network models can provide useful insights into the mechanisms that shape brain network structure, but more complex models that account for both physical and growth factors are needed to fully model the brain.
The paper describes research on the role of a gene called UBF in determining the activity of genes that code for ribosomal RNA. The authors found that mice lacking the UBF gene (ubf) fail to develop beyond the morula stage of embryonic development, indicating that UBF is required for early embryonic development. When they conditionally deleted the UBF gene in cells, they found that it completely shuts down ribosome transcription and disrupts the pre-initiation complex. However, this does not significantly affect the expression of genes required for ribosome biogenesis, indicating that ribosome transcription is not coordinated with gene expression. Instead, UBF likely induces a transition between active and inactive states of rRNA genes. UBF also induces large subnuclear structures called nucleolar precursor bodies that are distinct from rDNA loci. These findings suggest that UBF is the key factor in recruiting nucleolar proteins to the rDNA, but the exact mechanism is not yet clear.
The paper discusses the possibility that the unique RNA editing process found in kinetoplastid parasites, which can create multiple reading frames within a single gene, may be an adaptation to protect the genetic information of these parasites during extended growth in non-selective environments. The authors analyze the mitochondrial RNA transcriptomes of two kinetoplastid species, Trypanosoma brucei and Trypanosoma vivax, and find evidence that up to six genes are dual-coding, meaning they contain information for two distinct proteins within a single gene. This allows the parasites to maintain the genetic information within a single gene, protecting it from deleterious mutations that could occur during long periods of growth in the mammal host. The authors suggest that the RNA editing process, while complex and costly, may provide multiple mechanisms to increase genetic robustness by scattering essential genetic information throughout the genome, complementing gene fragmentation, and protecting critical genes that are essential for the parasite's survival in the mammal host. The ability to maintain dual-coding genes may be an advantage that allows the parasites to maximize their long-term survival and spread.
The paper describes a study that identified a novel gene, SPOCK, that is associated with the timing of menarche (the onset of menstruation) through a genome-wide association study (GWAS). The study used a GWAS to analyze 37,319 genetic markers in a cohort of 47 women and identified seven markers that were associated with the timing of menarche at a genome-wide significance level. The study replicated the findings in three independent cohorts containing 130 and 161 subjects, respectively. The gene, SPOCK, was found to play a role in regulating the inhibition of a protein called MMP-2, which is involved in the breakdown of the endometrium during menstruation. The study suggests that SPOCK may play an essential role in regulating the timing of menarche, although more research is needed to confirm this. The study highlights the potential of GWAS for identifying genetic factors underlying complex traits like menarche, which has significant impacts on women's health. However, the study also notes limitations of the small sample size and the need for further functional studies to fully understand the mechanisms of the identified gene.
The paper investigated the role of cathepsin B in regulating the immune response to Leishmania major infection. The authors found that cathepsin B-deficient bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDC) and macrophages (BMM) upregulated the expression of MHC class II molecules and the cytokine IL-12 in response to L. major promastigotes, compared to wild-type BMDC and BMM. This suggests that cathepsin B plays a role in instructing Th1 cell polarization. In contrast, cathepsin L-deficient BMDC and BMM showed no differences in MHC class II expression or cytokine production in response to L. major infection. The study suggests that cathepsin B may be involved in regulating the expression of cytokines, rather than antigen presentation, and co-stimulatory molecules, as a mechanism to instruct Th cell polarization. The results also suggest that inhibition of cathepsin B may improve the Th1-mediated clearance of L. major infection.
The paper investigates whether teaching genetics before evolution improves students' understanding and acceptance of evolution. The researchers found that when genetics was taught first, students showed significantly higher understanding and acceptance of evolution compared to when evolution was taught first. Specifically, genetics taught before evolution improved evolution understanding among higher ability students, while teaching genetics first had no negative impact on foundation ability students. The researchers conclude that teaching genetics first may be a simple and cost-free way to improve evolution understanding among higher ability students. However, they acknowledge that there are limitations to the study and that the results may not generalize to other contexts.
The paper investigates how the genetic diversity of West Nile virus (WNV) changes when it replicates in different bird species. The authors found that different bird species have distinct impacts on WNV population structure, with more disease-resistant birds producing more genetic diversity. Passage in crows, which experience high viremia and mortality, leads to more mutations that become fixed in the population, while passage in disease-resistant robins leads to fewer mutations. This suggests that disease susceptible birds may be more likely to drive virus evolution towards fitness gains. The results provide insight into the selective forces that shape WNV populations in nature and how different hosts influence virus evolution. The authors used various methods to analyze WNV genetic diversity, including next-generation sequencing and fitness competition assays. The findings suggest that intrahost selective pressures, rather than mosquito transmission, are the primary drivers of WNV genetic diversity and that more disease-resistant birds may be better at maintaining high fitness in WNV populations.
This paper investigates the relationship between driver mutations and DNA methylation changes in cancer. The researchers found that mutated driver genes are associated with specific DNAm alterations in a reproducible, site-specific manner across different types of cancer. Some driver genes are associated with extensive hypermethylation or hypomethylation of certain regions of the genome, which can shape regulatory networks and contribute to cancer hallmarks. The study identified subtypes of cancer based on the dominant driver gene-methylation associations. For example, they found that mutations in TP53 were associated with low methylation in certain regions, while mutations in BRAF were associated with high methylation in some regions and low methylation in others. The study suggests that driver mutations and DNAm alterations are closely linked and could potentially be used to identify subtypes of cancer for treatment. However, the causal relationship between mutations and DNAm changes remains unclear.
The paper found that women with genital schistosomiasis (Schistosoma haematobium) have more blood vessels and capillaries in their cervix and vagina compared to women without the infection. The blood vessels were more established and not as active neovascularization. The study found that viable schistosome ova were more often surrounded by granulation tissue rich in sprouting blood vessels compared to calcified ova. This suggests that the mucosal tissue surrounding viable ova may be more vascularized and prone to HIV infection. However, the sample size was small and the study had some limitations. The study did not find any significant associations between the age of the women, endothelial cell activation or HIV status and the blood vessel density. The findings suggest that the vascular changes in the mucosa may contribute to the risk of genital tract morbidity and HIV acquisition in women with schistosomias. Further studies are needed to validate the findings and explore the clinical correlates of the various histopathological manifestations in female genital schistosomias.
This paper presents a new method called E-Flux to predict metabolic capacity based on gene expression data. The method extends traditional flux balance analysis by using gene expression data to model the maximum possible flux through metabolic reactions. The idea is that mRNA levels provide an upper bound on the potential flux through enzymes, even though actual fluxes depend on enzyme kinetics, translation, etc. The authors applied the E-Flux method to predict the impact of drugs, environmental conditions on mycolic acid production in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. They found that E-Flux correctly predicted 7 of the 8 known inhibitors of mycolic acid production among 437 experiments from different studies. The method could potentially be used to model other metabolic states and predict the impact of drugs and conditions on metabolism in other organisms. The approach can help identify previously unknown effects of drugs and conditions, as well as guide metabolic engineering efforts. The authors hope the method will be useful for tuberculosis research and drug discovery, as there are many expression data sets available for this organism but it is difficult to measure metabolic activity directly.
This paper describes the structure and function of a type II secretin protein called OutS, which facilitates transport of secreted proteins across the outer membrane of bacteria. The authors determined the structure of OutS using X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy. They found that OutS binds tightly to the extreme C-terminus of the secretin protein OutD, causing the unstructured C-terminus to become helical. OutS has an unusual 4 helix bundle structure, unlike the T3SS pilotin which has an open β-barrel structure. The C-terminus of OutD contains 18 residues that bind to OutS, and the N-terminus of OutD contains a lipoprotein signal sequence that is covalently attached to a lipid. The authors showed that OutS can stabilize the truncated OutD and target it to the outer membrane, and that the 18 residue C-terminus of OutD is important for this. They also demonstrated that the 18 residue secretin peptide corresponding to the OutS-binding region becomes helical when bound to OutS. The structure of OutS suggests that evolution has independently evolved OutS to play a similar role as the T3SS pilotin, despite having different architectures.
This paper proposes a mathematical model that combines the chemical and mechanical aspects of cell polarity. The model integrates the reaction-diffusion model of Rho-GTP with the mechanical interactions of membrane tension to explain how cells polarize. The model suggests that membrane tension acts as a global inhibitor of cell polarity, reducing the sensitivity to external stimuli and allowing cells to maintain their polarity in response to random perturbations. The authors test their model using single cell experiments on breast cancer cells, showing that cells with lower membrane tension are more likely to polarize and change their polarity direction in response to new stimuli. They also find that cells with lower membrane tension are more sensitive to perturbations and exhibit a better searching strategy during migration. The model is able to recapitulate experimental results showing that cells with lower membrane tension, like cancer stem cells, are more prone to metastasis. The authors propose that targeting the membrane tension of tumor cells could be a new therapeutic strategy to prevent metastasis.
The paper describes a neural mass model that aims to describe the dynamics of cortical macrocolumns (groups of neurons) at a mesoscopic level. The model includes three populations of neurons: pyramidal cells, excitatory interneurons, and inhibitory interneurons. The model assumes periodic external inputs from nearby columns and internal excitatory and inhibitory connections. The authors find that even when all columns are identical and receive the same input, the activity of the columns can be segregated into excitatory and inhibitory modes. This segregation is found to depend on the strength of the excitatory and inhibitory connections between columns. The model shows that the degree of segregation can be quantified using an excitation-inhibition segregation index. The authors argue that this segregation of excitation and inhibition at the mesoscopic level may contribute to cooperative information processing in the brain, as it allows for a wider range of activity states to be explored without necessarily losing synchrony.
This paper explores how bacterial pathogens evolved to produce virulence factors that can manipulate host cells. The authors found that some virulence factors were likely evolved from bacterial genes that were translocated into host cells through interbacterial secretion systems like conjugative plasmids. They identified a protein called VbhTxin that is secreted alongside conjugative plasmids and functions as an interbacterial effector protein. This VbhTxin is similar to other FicTxin proteins that are secreted through type IV secretion systems like the T4SS of Bartonella bacteria. The VbhTxin is composed of an FIC domain that AMPylates host proteins and a BID domain that mediates plasmid transfer. The authors propose that the acquisition of FicTxin proteins as interbacterial effectors may be an important evolutionary missing link that facilitates the exaptation of genuine bacterial proteins as host-targeting virulence factors. They identified several examples of FicTxin proteins that have evolved into T4SS substrates. These interbacterial effectors were found to be secreted alongside conjugative plasmid transfer, and may have evolved independently of direct recruitment from bacterial genes. This study suggests that the recruitment of FicTxin proteins as interbacterial effectors may be a stepping stone in the evolution of host-targeting virulence factors.
This study found that ticks and dogs in Nigeria are infected with multiple vector-borne pathogens, including Ehrlichia canis, Rickettsia spp., Babesia rossi, and Anaplasma platys. The study found that 7.3% of dogs and 45% of ticks tested were infected with at least one vector-borne pathogen. The pathogens detected were Babesia rossi, Theileria sp., Candidatus N. mikurensis, Rickettsia conorii israelensis, and Anaplasma platys. The study found that there was a significant association between dogs being infected with Ehrlichia canis and ticks removed from them, but not with ticks infected with E. canis, A. platys or B. rossi. The results suggest that ticks may have acquired the infections during feeding on infected hosts and then transmitted them to their current hosts. This study highlights the importance of screening dogs and ticks for vector-borne pathogens to better understand the prevalence and role of these pathogens in Nigeria and West Africa. This information can help physicians and veterinarians in Nigeria and other West African countries diagnose and treat vector-borne diseases in humans and dogs.
This paper describes a computer model that simulates how the muscle fibers in skeletal muscle work. The model shows that multiple different mechanisms of cooperation between thin filaments and cross-bridges (XBs) contribute to the force generated during muscle contraction. The model shows that neighboring filaments and cross-bridges cooperate in activating thin filaments and recruiting additional XBs, which increases the force generated. The model finds that the number of activated thin filaments and XBs nearby has the greatest influence on cooperativity, and that the stiffness of the thin and thick filaments also affects cooperation. The study finds that the number of thin filaments activated and the stiffness of the filaments together determine the force generated, with the stiffness of the thin filaments affecting the sensitivity of the force-Ca relationship. The model provides a way to simulate and predict how different mechanisms of cooperation and changes in filament properties influence the force and speed of muscle contraction.
This paper proposes a new method called CERAMIC for genetic association mapping of binary traits in samples that contain related individuals. It is designed to handle partially missing data and can boost power by incorporating information from genotyped relatives. The method uses a retrospective approach to assess the significance of the test statistic and adjust for covariates, which allows it to be more robust to misspecification of the phenotype model. In simulations, the authors find that CERAMIC outperforms other binary trait methods, especially when covariates play a major role in the trait model. They apply CERAMIC to the Framingham Heart Study data and replicate association with previously identified T2D susceptibility loci. The method can also estimate the association parameter γ, which can be used to quantify the strength and direction of association or build a predictive model.
The paper discusses how a protein called Vpx is essential for the infection of macrophages by primate lentiviruses like HIV and SIV. Vpx antagonizes an antiviral restriction that macrophages express, which restricts the ability of viruses to infect these cells. The researchers found that this restriction is counteracted by the proteasome/ubiquitin system. Vpx ubiquitination is necessary for its ability to interact with a protein called DDB1, which is required for the restriction. DDB1 silencing in macrophages specifically impaired their susceptibility to infection by SIV but not HIV. The study suggests that Vpx usurps DDB1 after infection of the target cell and likely within the reverse transcription complex. The ability of Vpx to interact with DDB1 after infection likely determines its function. The researchers identified a paradox where HIV Vpr interacts with DDB1 to induce cell cycle arrest but does not efficiently counteract the macrophage restriction, while SIV Vpx interacts with DDB1 but does not induce cell cycle arrest. Further research is needed to understand how HIV Vpr and SIV Vpx interact with DDB1 differently and how they enhance infection of macrophages.
This paper discusses a study on the gene TDAG51 and its role in maternal behavior and postpartum depression in mice. TDAG51 is a gene that is expressed in the brain during pregnancy and after giving birth, and is associated with maternal care and the development of depressive-like and abnormal behavior in mice. The study found that mice lacking TDAG51 have a higher mortality rate among their pups after birth, indicating a defect in maternal care. TDAG51-dams also showed abnormal maternal behavior, such as poor nest building and reduced pup survival. When TDAG51 was overexpressed in the brain, the maternal behavior of TDAG51-dams was restored. The study also found that the expression of genes associated with neuroendocrine factors and monoamine neurotransmitters was altered in TDAG51-dams, suggesting that TDAG51 regulates these factors. The researchers propose that TDAG51 acts as a maternal care-associated gene that may be involved in the development of abnormal maternal behavior and postpartum depression in mice.
The paper discusses the genetic basis of parthenogenesis in the brown alga Ectocarpus siliculus. Parthenogenesis is a common trait in this species, where haploid gametes can develop into diploid sporophytes without fertilization. The researchers used a quantitative trait locus (QTL) approach to identify three QTLs that control parthenogenesis in the species. Two of the QTLs were found to be linked to the sex chromosome, while the third was located on an autosome. The QTLs were found to have different effects on male and female gametes, with females being parthenogenic regardless of the alleles they carried, while males were parthenogenic only when they had at least one allele at the autosomal QTL. The researchers identified 7 candidate genes within the QTL intervals that may be involved in parthenogenesis. They found that parthenogenesis in males resulted in reduced fitness during sexual reproduction, possibly due to reduced recombination rates and increased purifying selection. The authors suggest that sexually-antagonistic selection and ploidally-antagonistic selection may be the main factors maintaining genetic variation at the QTLs. The trait is likely beneficial for females, who can employ a bet-hedging strategy and produce gametes that can reproduce sexually or parthenogenically depending on environmental conditions.
The paper discusses how genetic variants in the gene NLGN1, which encodes a protein involved in synaptic function, may contribute to autism spectrum disorder. The authors identified five genetic variants in the NLGN1 gene in individuals with autism and analyzed their effects in vitro and in mice. They found that the variants caused changes in the structure and expression of the NLGN1 protein, which in turn affected its function. The variants led to reduced expression of the protein and impaired spine formation in neurons, which likely underlies the observed social interaction and spatial memory deficits in the mice. The study suggests that genetic variants in NLGN1 may play a role in the pathophysiology of autism and highlights the complexity of the genetic basis of the disorder.
The paper discusses a case-control study conducted in Cameroon to identify risk factors for Buruli ulcer, a neglected tropical disease caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans. The study found that wading in the Nyong river swamp and swimming in the Nyong river were risk factors, while fishing in the river was a protective factor. Living near cocoa plantations and woods was also a risk factor. The study found that low education level was a significant risk factor. The study found that long periods of skin exposure to water facilitated infection. It suggests that insect bites and contamination of a trauma site are likely the main modes of transmission. The use of bed nets was found to be a protective factor. The study confirms that treatment practices following trauma were a risk factor. The authors suggest that insects, likely mosquitoes, may be involved in transmission. Providing information about these risk factors and focusing on early detection and treatment can help reduce the burden of the disease until the mode of transmission is better understood.
The paper describes an analysis of exposure data collected during the ongoing West African Ebola epidemic in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone to understand the drivers of transmission and inform control measures. The analysis found that exposure to individuals who were dead or dying from Ebola outside of funeral context, and exposures shortly after death were important factors for transmission. Funeral exposures were also found to be a key amplifier of transmission. The proportion of cases reporting funeral attendance was correlated with local transmission intensity, suggesting that safe and dignified burials are an important factor. Hospitalization reduced transmission risk but did not eliminate it entirely. The analysis highlighted the need for improving infection control in all healthcare facilities, particularly in non-Ebola treatment units. The results also showed high heterogeneity in the number of times a case was named as a potential source contact, suggesting that simple demographic characteristics are unlikely to identify those most at risk of super-spreading. The findings provide a quantitative basis for prevention measures against Ebola, but the challenges faced in the field make it likely that there will be episodic flare-ups. Continued data collection and analysis are important to track transmission patterns and inform resource deployment to hasten elimination of the virus from the human population.
This paper investigated the interaction between the filovirus non-segmented RNA virus proteins NP and VP30. They found that the NP protein has a conserved binding site for VP30 that is located in the C-terminal half of the protein, specifically residues 60-67. They identified this binding site using biotinylated NP peptides and crystal structures of the EBOV and MARV VP30-NP complexes. They showed that VP30 binds to this site with a dissociation constant of 5.69±0.4 μM. They used this interaction to study the importance of the NP-VP30 interaction for viral RNA synthesis and replication by performing mini-replicon assays and found that VP30 mutants with lower binding affinity for NP had reduced or no RNA synthesis activity. They also showed that weak interactions between VP30 and NP were still able to support some RNA synthesis, indicating that the binding site on VP30 is preformed. The VP30-NP interaction is essential for viral RNA synthesis, but it appears to tune the overall activity to an ideal level, rather than maximizing it. The authors propose that the binding of VP30 to NP may restrict access of the polymerase to the viral genome and stabilize the nucleocapsid, but further decreasing the interaction would allow greater access to the polymerase, leading to reduced RNA synthesis. The study identified a conserved binding site for VP30 on NP across the filovirus genus and provided insights into the molecular basis for the VP30-NP interaction, which could be used to develop therapeutic drugs targeting this interaction.
This paper proposes a new approach to controlling mosquito-borne diseases by releasing mosquitoes carrying anti-pathogen genes that can reduce their ability to transmit diseases. The authors used a detailed model of Aedes aegypti mosquito population dynamics in an urban setting to simulate the impact of releasing mosquitoes carrying single anti-pathogen genes versus genes that cause female-specific lethality or both anti-pathogen and female-specific lethality. They found that releasing mosquies carrying single anti-pathogen genes at relatively low numbers of mosquitoes can significantly reduce the number of mosquitoes that can transmit diseases. This approach is more effective than releasing mosquitoes that carry genes that cause population reduction alone. The anti-pathogen genes can spread through the population without reducing population density, which makes them less vulnerable to immigration from wild mosquitoes. Releasing eggs instead of adults can also be effective. The approach does not require gene-drive mechanisms and could potentially be implemented in the near future. However, the anti-pathogen genes may have fitness costs that need to be considered. The authors suggest that releasing mosquitoes at lower numbers than those required for population reduction could provide a viable alternative to gene-drive based strategies.
The paper discusses how obesity affects the liver's protein synthesis and metabolism. The authors found that when mice are obese, they have reduced protein synthesis in the liver, particularly in the endoplasmic reticulum. This reduction in protein synthesis is caused by increased eIF2α phosphorylation, which inhibits the initiation of protein synthesis. However, the polysome profiles of obese mice showed that there were more ribosomes bound to mRNA molecules, indicating that protein synthesis was still occurring. The authors found that genes involved in transcription, splicing and transport were downregulated, while genes involved in mitochondrial function were upregulated. They found that the downregulation of Cyp7b1, a gene involved in bile acid synthesis, was responsible for the reduction in glucose levels in obese mice. Overexpressing Cyp7b1 in obese mice improved glucose levels but also caused cholestasis. The study suggests that obesity may experience a molecular fasting profile in the liver despite having access to abundant nutrients, and that genes regulated by fasting may provide insights into the pathogenesis of metabolic disorders. The discovery of novel regulatory patterns governing bile acid metabolism may provide new therapeutic strategies.
According to the paper, the authors propose a "V1 saliency hypothesis" that the saliency of a visual location is determined by the response of the most active cell in the visual area V1 responding to that location. They argue that this is the most efficient way to determine the salient location, since it can be done by a single operation. They test this hypothesis through experiments where they show that the response of the most active cell determines the saliency of the visual location. They find that the saliency of a texture border depends on the response of the most active cell, and not the sum of the responses of all cells. They also find that irrelevant features can interfere with saliency, and that the degree of interference depends on the relative strength of the irrelevant responses compared to the relevant responses. They conclude that their experiments provide direct behavioral evidence supporting the V1 saliency hypothesis and that it is a neurally based account.
This paper investigated how double-strand breaks (DSBs) are repaired when they arise from different breaks. The researchers found that repair involving ends from different breaks is slower than repair involving ends from the same break, suggesting that DSB ends need to be in close proximity to each other to initiate repair through the homology search. However, the repair efficiency of repair involving ends from different breaks is not significantly affected by the distance between the homologous donor sequences. The results suggest that the Recombination Execution Checkpoint (REC) cannot distinguish between the origins of the synapsed ends and does not specifically restrict repair involving ends from different breaks. The slower repair in the Trans configuration likely results from the lack of association between the ends, which must independently search for their homologous donors. The researchers propose that DSB ends remain tethered for a time after break formation, which can interfere with repair involving ends from different breaks. This tethering may play a role in preventing chromosomal translocations.
This paper investigated how multiple types of helminth infections affect the severity of malaria infections. The study found that the presence of multiple helminths in a patient can have a profound impact on the severity of malaria, beyond the effects of any single helminth species alone. The researchers identified co-infections between four different types of helminths and found that some helminths interacted in a way that reduced the protective effects of others. Specifically, the presence of the hookworm Necator americanus weakened the protection provided by the trichuris trichiura, while co-infection with all three helminths (Ascaris lumbricoides, trichuris, and hookworm) occurred more frequently than expected by chance. This suggests that the co-occurrence of certain helminth species can have cryptic and profound implications for malaria infections. The findings highlight the importance of considering the parasite community as a whole when evaluating disease control strategies, particularly in regions where high parasite diversity and co-infections are common.
This paper analyzes the human Y chromosome and finds that it has extremely low genetic diversity compared to other chromosomes. The authors argue that this low diversity cannot be explained by sex-biased demography, where there are more females than males in the population, as previous studies have suggested. Instead, they show that purifying selection, or background selection, acting on neutral mutations on the Y chromosome is the most likely explanation. This is consistent with the fact that the Y chromosome has no recombination and lacks genes, making it vulnerable to purifying selection. The authors also show that the number of sites under purifying selection is much higher than the number of coding mutations, indicating that the highly repetitive ampliconic regions on the Y chromosome are likely under selection. They conclude that the low diversity on the Y chromosome provides a useful marker for studying population history and evolution, as positive selection on the chromosome could have confounded estimates from other markers.
The paper investigated how well different HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) neutralize different HIV strains. They found that bNAbs targeting the high-mannose patch on Env and CD4bs bind most viruses with a neutralization plateau of around 10%, while bNAbs targeting the V2 apex and MPER bind fewer viruses with a plateau of less than 10%. This suggests that some HIV strains may be more resistant to some bNAbs. The bNAbs that target the high-mannose patch were found to be less sensitive to glycan heterogeneity, while bNAbs targeting the V2 apex were more sensitive. The results suggest that incomplete neutralization of some HIV strains by bNAbs may limit their ability to protect against HIV infection. However, the study did not directly investigate how incomplete neutralization in pseudovirus assays relates to protection in vivo, as incomplete neutralization was observed in primary virus assays and PBMC cultures. Further studies are needed to determine the impact of incomplete neutralization on vaccine development and bNAb-mediated protection.
The paper describes the role of a protein called TgGCN5-A in the parasite Toxoplasma gondii in responding to stress, specifically high pH stress. The authors found that TgGCN5-A is required for Toxoplasma tachyzoites to activate genes that are up-regulated in response to high pH, and for the parasites to recover from high pH stress. They showed that TgGCN5-A is required for the parasites to up-regulate genes that are typically up-regulated during cyst formation, which is a developmental change in the parasite life cycle. The authors found that TgGCN5-A is required for the parasites to properly regulate gene expression in response to high pH stress, and that TgGCN5-A knockout parasites are defective in activating genes that are up-regulated during high pH stress, which suggests that TgGCN5-A plays a key role in the Toxoplasma response to alkaline pH stress. The study demonstrates that TgGCN5-A plays a major role in the normal response to high pH stress and provides insight into the molecular basis of the alkaline stress response in Toxoplasma. The findings suggest that TgGCN5-A is essential for the parasite's ability to adapt to changes in intracellular pH, which is likely important for its survival and pathogenesis in vivo.
This paper studies the distribution of transposable elements (TEs) in bacterial genomes, which are called transposable elements. The authors find that the abundance of TE copies in bacterial genomes can be explained by a simple model of duplication, deletion, and lateral gene transfer (LGT) that assumes no selection. This neutral model can be used to study the dynamics of TE copies in different genomes. They find that most TE families behave similarly, with a duplication-deletion ratio close to 0.9. They also find that LGT rates are correlated with the number of genomes that host a given TE family, but do not correlate with the actual abundance of copies. This suggests that LGT determines the spreading of TE across genomes, while duplications and deletions drive the long-term persistence of TE copies within genomes. The authors conclude that the persistence of TEs in bacterial genomes is due to a neutral process, with little role for selection. They argue that sporadic cases of TE insertions affected by selection may occur, but the neutral behavior dominates at large evolutionary scales. They propose that studying the dynamics of TEs in bacterial genomes could provide insights into the processes that rule the architecture of genomes.
The paper describes a study on how the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa can manipulate the host cell's ubiquitin system to reduce the amount of chloride secretion from airway epithelial cells. The bacterium produces a toxin called Cif that is secreted through its outer membranes and binds to host airway epithelial cells. Cif inhibits a host enzyme called USP10, which normally degrades chloride channels (CFTR) in the host cells. By inhibiting USP10, Cif reduces the amount of CFTR in the host cells, which in turn reduces the host's ability to secrete chloride and clear pathogens from the airways. This allows the bacteria to more easily infect the host. The study shows that Cif does this by increasing the amount of ubiquitinated CFTR, which targets CFTR for degradation in lysosomes. This is the first time a bacterial toxin has been found to target and regulate a host ubiquitin ligase. The study provides insights into how bacteria manipulate the host cell's ubiquitin system to enhance their ability to infect and colonize.
This paper describes a new method for measuring circulating insulin levels in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. The researchers were able to label insulin with two immuno-epitopes that preserved its bioactivity, allowing them to quantify insulin levels in vivo. They found that only a small fraction of total insulin in the insulin-producing cells (IPCs) is secreted, and that changes in circulating insulin levels are regulated by genetic and molecular mechanisms. The new method enabled the discovery of genetic factors that regulate insulin production and secretion in Drosophila, which could help identify conserved mechanisms relevant to human metabolic diseases. They identified two genes that regulate systemic insulin levels in Drosophila, and found that genetic changes in the insulin receptor in fat body tissue led to enhanced insulin secretion. The results suggest that measuring insulin levels in Drosophila could be useful for identifying genetic factors that contribute to human metabolic diseases.
This paper proposes a new method to identify druggable regions on protein surfaces. The authors hypothesize that a protein's ability to form a pocket at a particular interaction site is the limiting factor for druggability at that site. They test this hypothesis by using simulations to bias the protein towards generating conformations that contain pockets. They find that conformations that contain pockets are more likely to occur at the interaction site, and that conformations that do not contain pockets require more energetic cost to the protein. This suggests that pockets are encoded in the protein structure in a way that allows them to form with little cost. The authors propose that matching protein conformations that contain pockets could be used to identify potential drug-like conformations that could be used to design new inhibitors. The approach could be used to identify new druggable conformations beyond those identified using known inhibitors. The method could be useful for identifying potential druggable sites on proteins where no known inhibitors exist.
This paper describes a new technique for imaging the morphology of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) in living cells. The researchers developed a hybrid imaging system that combines atomic force microscopy (AFM) with confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) to visualize both the structure of the plasma membrane and the protein localization of clathrin and other proteins involved in CME. By simultaneously imaging the membrane morphology and protein distribution, they found that the size of clathrin spots (CCPs) ranged from 150-40 nm, which is larger than previously reported, and that the CCPs are coupled with protein assembly and membrane invagination. They observed various CCP dynamics, including capping, two-step closure, and re-opening, which were found to be related to actin dynamics. Inhibition of actin polymerization accelerated CME, while stabilization of the actin network prolonged it. The study showed that dynamin is involved in the closing step of CME, but also in the assembly and maturation phases, and knockdown of dynamin prolonged the CME lifetime. The researchers propose that actin polymerization generates local forces on the membrane, while dynamin binds to the neck of the CCP and catalyzes scission. The technique provides a new way to study the morphology and dynamics of CME, which has previously been limited to snapshot imaging of fixed cells. The study suggests that actin and dynamin are involved in CME through different mechanisms, and that membrane swelling during capping is likely caused by rapid actin polymerization.
This paper investigated the genetic architecture of salinity tolerance in rice, specifically looking at the genetic variation in rice that affects the ability of the plant to grow in high salt conditions. The researchers used a genome-wide association study (GWA) of 383 rice accessions to identify genetic variants that are associated with root and shoot ion content under salt stress. They found that a variant of the HKT1;1 gene, which encodes a sodium transporter, is responsible for the observed differences in root Na+ content between indica and japonica rice. The high root Na+ variants of HKT1;1 have higher Na+ transport activity, which allows them to maintain root growth under saline conditions. This suggests that HKT1;1 is a key gene underlying salinity tolerance in rice. The researchers also found that shoot Na+ exclusion is not always the main mechanism for salt tolerance in rice, and that other mechanisms may be more important, especially during mild to moderate salt stress. The findings provide insights into how rice has evolved to be salt tolerant in different subpopulations.
The paper proposes a neural network model that uses gamma oscillations to represent a time-varying stimulus like a diphone in speech. The network has excitatory and inhibitory neurons that generate and sustain gamma oscillations, with different functional subpopulations of neurons that respond to different parts of the input signal. The gamma oscillations discretize the neural response to the stimulus into a binary representation of which neurons fired during which cycles. The binary representation consists of a list of which cells fired during which cycle. The network shows robustness to moderate noise and time warping of the stimulus, but with a tradeoff between resolution and robustness. The model suggests that oscillations in the brain may play a role in representing time-varying signals like speech, with different oscillations on different timescales possibly representing different aspects of the signal. The approach could potentially be used to develop a neural network front-end to improve speech recognition systems that better model the temporal dynamics of speech. However, the current model uses a very simplified stimulus model and would need to be extended to represent more realistic speech signals. Further empirical work would be needed to determine how well the model works for real speech signals and how to implement the readout mechanism.
The paper discusses how B cells contribute to protective immunity against parasitic infections, specifically against the parasite Necator americanus. The researchers found that B cells are essential for resolving primary and secondary infections with Necator, and that B cells can rapidly respond to the parasite through multiple mechanisms, including antigen presentation and cytokine production. They showed that B cells expressing the IL-4 receptor alpha (IL-4Rα) are particularly important for this immunity, as they produce IL-3 and increase the production of IL-13 by CD4 T cells and B cells. The protective B cell response is not dependent on antibody production, but instead involves direct interactions between B cells and T cells through Toll-like receptors and MHCII molecules. The researchers suggest that B cells may play a key role in facilitating the activation of protective mechanisms against Necator infection, including the production of IL-13, and that their rapid responses may be independent of clonal expansion. The study demonstrates that B cells are important for controlling Necator infections and that their rapid response may be mediated through rapid antigen processing and presentation.
This paper describes the results of an experiment testing the efficacy of 8 different monoclonal antibodies against the Ebola virus glycoprotein (GP) as a potential post-exposure treatment. The researchers created 8 monoclonal antibodies against the GP protein and tested them in both mice and guinea pigs. They found that while some of the antibodies partially protected mice infected with a lethal dose of the virus, only 2 of them (2G4 and 4G7) provided 60% survival in guinea pigs infected with the virus. The optimal dose for protection in mice varied between the different antibodies, but generally the most effective dose was around 10 μg. Treating mice with the antibodies 1 day before or 1 day after infection provided the most protection. In guinea pigs, a combination of the 3 neutralizing antibodies was the most effective treatment, extending survival from 6.5 days to 11.17 days. The study suggests that using a combination of antibodies that target different regions of GP may be the most effective approach. While some antibodies were effective in mice, none were as effective as the neutralizing antibody KZ52, which was able to completely protect guinea pigs. The results suggest that a combination of neutralizing antibodies may be a promising post-exposure treatment for Ebola virus infections, but further testing is needed in non-human primates.
The paper describes the discovery of a small molecule inhibitor of hepatitis C virus (HCV) entry, called EI-1. The researchers used a pseudovirus (HCVpp) infection system to identify the compound, which inhibited HCV entry by blocking an early step downstream of attachment to heparan sulfate proteoglycans on the cell surface. The inhibitor was found to be most effective against genotype 1 HCV, with a selectivity index of over 2000 compared to genotype 2-5 HCV. The results suggest that EI-1 inhibits HCV entry by binding to the E1 envelope protein, likely at residue 719 in the transmembrane domain. The inhibitor was also shown to block cell-to-cell spread of HCV infection, indicating that it functions at the cell-to-cell transmission pathway. The researchers propose that EI-1 may interact with the E2 protein at this site, although the exact mechanism is unclear. The study demonstrates that entry inhibitors could provide a valuable component of combination therapy for HCV infection, particularly in combination with replication inhibitors, interferon and other host-targeting therapies. However, the development of such inhibitors will require robust preclinical assays and clinical studies to evaluate their efficacy and safety, as HCV has a high error rate and rapidly emerging resistance.
The paper describes a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and subsequent analyses to identify genetic factors associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), a rare epithelial malignancy with high incidence in certain parts of Asia. The GWAS found genetic variations in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes on chromosomes 6 and 16 were strongly associated with NPC. Specifically, the HLA-A*101 allele was found to be the most protective allele, carrying five amino acid variants in the peptide binding groove that are associated with NPC. The HLA-B*13:01 and B*5:02 alleles were also associated with NPC. The HLA-C*03:02 and HLA-C*12:02 alleles were also found to be associated with NPC, but at a lower level. The study found that many of the genetic associations were tracked by other genetic variations in the HLA genes, suggesting that these were proxies or surrogates for the functional variants. To further confirm the associations, high-resolution HLA genotyping and amino acid analysis were performed. The results showed that the HLA-A*101 allele and the HLA-B*16Leu variant were the primary genetic drivers of the associations. The study provides evidence that genetic variations in the HLA genes, particularly the peptide binding groove, are associated with NPC development.
The paper discusses how the lack of knowledge of the number of people who are infected with a disease in the early stages of an outbreak makes it difficult to predict whether or not a major outbreak will occur. The authors use simulations of stochastic compartmental epidemic models to investigate how the uncertainty caused by presymptomatic infection affects the ability to predict major outbreaks. They find that even when the values of disease transmission parameters are known, the number of presymptomatic infected people is unobserved, which leads to an error in estimating the probability of a major outbreak. They conclude that diagnostic tests that can identify presymptomatic infected individuals are crucial for improving predictions, though expensive. They show that this applies to a wide range of pathogens, including Ebola, HIV, and influenza, and that considering the impact of presymptomatic infection on forecasting is important when planning interventions.
This paper proposes that synchronization of neurons can help protect them from the influence of random noise. The authors show mathematically that when neurons are synchronized, the effects of random noise on their behavior are reduced, allowing them to carry out meaningful computations even in the presence of high levels of intrinsic noise. They use a simple model of FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillators, which are nonlinear systems. They show that synchronization can help the neurons "average out" the noise, making their behaviors more similar to those of a noise-free system. This helps the neurons "protect" themselves from the noise, even when the noise is strong. They also argue that synchronization mechanisms may underlie other types of redundant calculations in biological systems, such as in otoliths, muscles, and transcription regulation networks. They suggest that ensemble measurements from the brain may actually represent ensemble synchronization mechanisms, and could provide inputs to brain-machine interfaces.
The paper studies the genetic variation and phylogenetic history of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in Colombia, which is a major vector for dengue fever and yellow fever. The researchers found two distinct genetic groups within the mosquitoes based on their mitochondrial DNA, one related to West Africa and one related to East Africa. They found that the group related to West Africa was present in cities where insecticides were used frequently, while the group related to East Africa was present in cities with lower dengue fever incidence and no insecticide use. This suggests that the use of insecticides may have reduced the genetic diversity of the West African group. The high genetic diversity of the East African group may indicate that it is a more recent introduction to Colombia, possibly through gene flow from other countries. The presence of these distinct genetic groups suggests that different vector control measures and environmental factors may influence the ability of the mosquitoes to transmit dengue and yellow fever viruses, which could have implications for controlling the diseases. The study provides insight into the evolutionary history of the mosquitoes and how it may impact the spread of the diseases, which could inform future control strategies.
The paper investigates the genetic diversity of Cryptocococcus neoformans, a fungus that causes severe lung and neurological infections, in Brazil. The researchers analyzed 145 clinical and environmental isolates of the major molecular type VGII using standardized MLST (Multilocus Sequence Typing) to assess the genetic variability within the Brazilian population. They found 81 sequence types, with high haplotype diversity indicating high genetic variability. Most regions had different genotypes, but a clonal complex composed of ST27, which is associated with the less virulent subtype VGIIb, was identified as playing an important role in the epidemiological distribution of Cryptococcus. The study shows that recombination events occur within the Brazilian isolates, leading to the high genetic diversity observed. This supports the idea that Cryptoccus is an opportunistic fungus that can adapt and colonize new environments and hosts, and emerge in new populations through recombination. The findings suggest that the Brazilian isolates likely originated from South American populations, possibly through recombination in the transitional ecological areas between humid and dry regions. The study highlights the ecological adaptability of Cryptococcus to spread to new habitats and the potential role of human activities in geographical dispersal of the fungus.
This paper describes an experiment in which the authors tested the effectiveness of a treatment that combines an antibiotic and an anti-inflammatory drug in controlling microbial translocation and immune activation in rhesus macaques infected with SIV. The treatment involved administering the antibiotic Rifaximin to reduce the intestinal bacteria and the anti-inflammatory drug Sulfasalazine to reduce inflammation. The results showed that this treatment reduced levels of microbial translocation, immune activation and inflammation in the acute stage of infection, as measured by markers such as LPS, CD14, CD8 expression, Ki67 expression, and T cell proliferation. However, this effect was only transient and did not last beyond the 3 month duration of the treatment. The authors conclude that while controlling microbial translocation and immune activation in the early stages of infection may be a promising approach to improving the outcome of HIV infection, this treatment is unlikely to be applicable to chronically infected patients who have more extensive mucosal damage. The treatment also had some side effects, such as reduction of beneficial gut bacteria and potential long-term toxicity.
The paper describes a study on how a protein called CD24 on T cells is related to the development of a disease called HAM/TSP (Human T-cell Leukemia/Lymphoma Syndrome Type SP). The researchers found that CD24 is overexpressed on T cells of people with HAM/TSP compared to healthy donors, and that this is associated with high levels of a protein called SAP (Signal Transducer and Activator Protein). CD24 and SAP are involved in activation of cytotoxic T cells and the production of inflammatory molecules. They also found that blocking CD24 or SAP inhibited the function of T cells from people with HAM/TSP, suggesting that CD24/SAP is involved in the dysregulation of T cell function in this disease. This study suggests that the overexpression of CD24 on T cells may contribute to the development and progression of HAM/TSP.
The paper discusses the role of the protein Mus8 in mouse meiosis, specifically in regulating the formation of crossovers (crossovers) during the process of meiosis. The authors found that when the Mus8 protein is deleted, meiotic progression is disrupted and there is reduced fertility. They found that while the number of crossovers is not significantly increased, there is an increase in the number of MutL proteins (MutL1 and MutL3) on chromosomes at late prophase I, indicating that Mus8 plays a role in processing a subset of crossovers. However, the number of chiasmata (physical crossovers) remains unchanged. They propose that Mus8 plays both an early and late role in recombination events, possibly through different pathways, and that Mus8 functions upstream of Rad51 and downstream of MLH1-MLH3. They suggest that Mus8 acts as a surveillance mechanism to prevent MLH1-MLH3 from binding to certain crossover sites, which leads to an increase in MLH1 foci and a decrease in interference between MLH1 foci. The authors propose that Mus8 functions as a complex integration between MLH1-MLH3 and BLM to regulate crossovers in mammals.
This paper describes a study that aimed to determine the serological profiles of mothers of infants born with microcephaly in a hyperendemic area of dengue fever in Brazil. The study found that a large proportion of mothers had evidence of past exposure to Zika virus, with a higher proportion among mothers of infants with microcephaly. However, many mothers had low levels of Zika-specific antibodies at the time of delivery, suggesting that they had been exposed to Zika virus some time before giving birth. The researchers used a combination of tests including PRNT, ELISA, and IgG3-NS1 assays to determine the mothers' Zika and dengue virus antibody levels. They found that most mothers had exposure to multiple flaviviruses, mostly dengue 3 and 4, and that a high proportion of mothers of microcephaly cases had evidence of recent Zika infection. The study suggests that the low levels of Zika antibodies among mothers at delivery may be due to a lag time between virus exposure and delivery, and that maternal antibodies are transferred efficiently to the fetus during pregnancy. The findings suggest that screening for Zika virus immunity during pregnancy could help monitor congenital Zika infection in hyperendemic areas.
The paper proposes a mathematical model that suggests that the onset of type 2 diabetes is triggered by a sudden transition from a state of insulin resistance to a state of high levels of the inflammatory signaling molecule interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta). The model suggests that this transition happens when glucose levels reach a certain threshold value, which is associated with a bifurcation in the IL-1 beta/IL-1 receptor system. The model predicts that anti-inflammatory therapy that blocks IL-1 beta activity is effective in preventing or reversing the loss of insulin producing beta cells during the early stages of type 2 diabetes, but needs to be released after a certain time to allow for beta cell growth and reconstitution. The model also suggests that glucose control alone cannot cure type 2 diabetes, but keeping the patient in the pre-diabetic state allows for a longer-term benefit. The model provides a framework for understanding the complex processes involved in the progression of type 2 diabetes and the potential benefits and limitations of different anti-inflammatory therapies.
The paper discusses the role of CD8+ T cells in cutaneous leishmaniasis, a disease caused by the parasite Leishmania. The researchers found that CD8+ T cells in human lesions are not only producing cytokines like IFN-γ, but are also actively killing infected cells, leading to increased inflammation and pathology. They showed in a mouse model that CD8+ T cells contribute to the development of larger lesions and metastatic lesions in cutaneous leishmaniasis, and that this is due to their cytotoxic activity rather than IFN-γ production. The researchers propose that CD8+ T cells are pathogenic in cutaneous leishmaniasis, while CD4+ T cells may regulate their cytotoxic activity. They suggest that evaluating the CD4:CD8 ratio in biopsies may help predict disease outcome. The study highlights the importance of understanding how CD8+ T cell effector function is regulated in leishmaniasis in order to develop new therapies or vaccines.
The paper explores how microbes' growth rates are influenced by the expression of unused or underutilized proteins. The authors use a genome-scale model of Escherichia coli's proteome and compare it to quantitative proteomics data from 16 different environments. They find that unused protein expression can vary significantly across environments, with high growth rates having lower unused protein fractions. The core proteome, which is used across all environments, increases linearly with growth rate while overexpression of the core proteome can increase vivo enzyme turnover. In contrast, the non-core proteome, which is used for nutrient readiness and stress resistance, decreases linearly with growth rate. The expression of non-core proteins, especially the C-proteome, is found to up-regulated under nutrient shifts and limitations, which results in increased unused protein expression. This suggests that microbes allocate their proteomes to optimize growth under different environmental conditions, with the core proteome providing a fitness benefit at high growth rates and the non-core proteins providing nutrient readiness. The study suggests that the expression of unused protein can be an important factor in determining microbial growth rates and that genome-scale models that incorporate this regulation may improve predictions of growth rates.
The paper describes the discovery of a protein kinase A (PKA) in the adult stage of the Schistosoma mansoni parasite. They found that a protein kinase assay demonstrated PKA activity in adult Schistosoma worm extracts, which was sensitive to inhibitors that target PKA-C subunits. They identified a full-length cDNA sequence encoding a Schistosoma PKA-C subunit (SmPKA-C) that was expressed in all life stages of the parasite cycle, including adults. Treatment with inhibitors of PKA-C activity killed the parasites, suggesting that the Schistoma PKA is essential for viability. They also found that RNA interference of the SmPKA-C gene was lethal to the parasites, confirming that the protein is important for parasite viability. While the full-length cDNA sequence identified encodes a portion of the PKA activity in adults, additional PKA isoforms may also be expressed. The discovery of a functional PKA in adult Schistoma suggests that targeting this protein could be a new approach for controlling Schistosoma infections.
The paper explores how changes in the sensitivity of a receptor called the muscarinic receptor M2R to different voltages affect the activity of a potassium channel called IK,ACh in the human sinus node (SN) cell. The M2R is found to be intrinsically voltage sensitive, meaning its affinity for acetylcholine (ACh) varies with the voltage potential across the cell membrane. This voltage sensitivity has implications for how IK,ACh is activated and how it affects the SN cell's spontaneous firing rate. The authors built a mathematical model of the M2R and IK,ACh, incorporating the voltage sensitivity. They found that low concentrations of ACh (subsaturating) preferentially activate IK,ACh during diastolic voltages, slowing the SN cell's spontaneous firing rate. They simulated the effects of genetic variants that shift the M2R's voltage sensitivity towards either a hyperpolarized or depolarized state, and found that these changes in M2R sensitivity could contribute to cardiovascular diseases associated with changes in vagal tone. For example, genetic variants that increase IK,ACh activation at low vagal tone could increase the risk of vagally-mediated atrial fibrillation, while variants that decrease IK,ACh activation could decrease the effects of vagal modulation of heart rate and increase basal heart rate. The study provides a novel foundation for studying the role of M2R voltage sensitivity in cardiac diseases.
The paper describes a model that attempts to explain how electrical synapses in neurons can exhibit instantaneous conductance-voltage rectification and bidirectional transmission. The model uses a 36-state model of voltage gating for gap junction channels to simulate the changes in electrical conductance across synapses. The model shows that instantaneous rectification of gap junctions can cause directional asymmetry of electrical transmission, and that voltage-dependent changes in gap junction conductance can be induced by trains of action potentials. The model also shows that chemical modulation of gap junctions can affect junction conductance, potentially leading to longer-term changes in electrical synaptic plasticity. The authors propose that this could play a role in modulating neuronal synchrony and the strength of electrical synapses, which can affect information processing and brain function. While the model is a simplification, it demonstrates how voltage and chemical modulation of electrical synapses can interact to shape neuronal activity.
This paper describes a new mechanism by which the cell's response to DNA damage is regulated. The authors found that a protein called ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated kinase) regulates the expression of a microRNA called miR-35, which in turn regulates the expression of a protein called CtIP. When ATM is active, it suppresses miR-35 expression, which leads to defects in the DNA damage response. When miR-35 is overexpressed, it reduces the expression of CtIP, which leads to defects in DNA repair and sensitizes the cells to radiation damage. The authors found that this mechanism is particularly effective in cancer cells, where it may help explain why some cancer cells are more resistant to radiation therapy. The authors propose that miR-35 could be targeted to make cancer cells more sensitive to radiation therapy.
Sure, here is a layman summary of the paper:  The paper investigates the prevalence of liver fluke infection caused by the parasite Amphimerus sp. in cats and dogs living in communities where there is a high prevalence of infection in humans in Ecuador. The study found that both cats and dogs are infected with Amphimer sp. at a relatively high rate, indicating that they act as definitive and reservoir hosts for the parasite. This confirms that amphimeris is a zoonosis, where animals and humans are infected simultaneously. The study found that cats were more likely to be infected than dogs and that the prevalence of in cats was significantly higher. This suggests that cats play a role in transmitting the parasite to humans through eating smoked or raw fish, while dogs may become infected by swimming in contaminated water. The findings provide important information for developing control measures against Amphimer sp. infection, including treating both animals and humans with a specific drug. The study highlights the importance of considering the role of domestic animals as reservoirs in transmitting this neglected tropical disease.
The paper discusses why the HIV virus has a much lower surface density of spike proteins compared to other viruses like influenza and hepatitis C. It suggests that this may be an evolutionary advantage for HIV as it allows it to avoid effective antibody responses in the early stages of infection. HIV infects CD4 T cells which are depleted during the early stages of infection. This depletion of T cells results in weaker selection forces during affinity maturation, so a low spike density allows HIV to generate high affinity antibodies. HIV can then maintain its infectivity and avoid immune responses while replicating at a high rate. In contrast, other viruses with high spike densities may be more susceptible to antibodies and neutralization. The paper presents a model that shows that a low spike density can result in high affinity antibodies during affinity maturation, but only when there are few T cells available to provide strong selection forces. This is consistent with HIV's unique low spike density. The results may guide vaccine design by optimizing the density of antigens presented to maximize affinity maturation and avoid high affinity antibodies.
The authors used a biochemical approach to study the changes in phosphorylation of proteins in neurons after depolarization with high concentrations of potassium ions. They found that the phosphorylation of certain proteins was dependent on the level of calcium influx and that this phosphorylation was long-lasting and targeted distinct protein domains and networks. They identified specific protein kinases that mediated the initial and poststimulus response and were activated by the stimulus. They also found that the active zone scaffold proteins were more highly targeted by activity-dependent phosphorylation, suggesting that the active zone scaffold is more finely tuned to respond to calcium influx. They identified bassoon as a major presynaptic signaling hub and potential integrator of phosphorylation. The study provides valuable insights into the temporal dynamics of phosphorylation in neurons and highlights the need for further validation of the results with electrophysiological stimulation paradigms.
The paper presents a theoretical framework to determine which type of spatial representation an animal uses to navigate based on its navigation behavior. The authors show that different types of spatial representations (like egocentric or allocentric) accumulate noise in different ways during path integration, and this determines the type of trajectory the animal follows in representational space. They classify spatial representations into four types: egocentric static vectorial, egocentric dynamic, allocentric static vectorial and allocentric dynamic vectorial. They show that an allocentric dynamic vectorial representation is most tolerant to noise and follows a straight trajectory in representational space, while the other types of representations follow an idiothetic or allothetic directed walk. They argue that animals are likely to use an allocentric dynamic vectorial representation to navigate, since it can map spatial information from allocentric sensory inputs to allocentric neurons in a linear way. This allows the animal to generate a consistent spatial representation during path integration and tolerate noise. The results provide a theoretical basis for understanding how animals navigate based on path integration and how their neural representation of space may have evolved to be most suitable for navigation.
This paper describes a new model for how spectrin proteins, which are important for maintaining cell shape, can extend and contract. The authors propose that spectrin tetramers are not rigidly linked together like the previously thought extended model suggests, but instead are connected by a flexible linker region that can bend and rotate, allowing them to extend and contract. This bending and rotation of the linker region creates favorable interactions between adjacent spectrin repeats, allowing the tetramer to maintain its structure. The model also predicts that the spectrin tetramer is a hollow cylinder at its resting length, rather than a solid rod as previously thought. The authors use a "Chinese Finger Trap" model to explain the structure of the spectrin tetramer, which consists of a series of alternating spectrin repeats linked by a flexible linker region that can bend and rotate. The model is supported by experimental evidence from electron microscopy, mass spectrometry, and X-ray crystallography. The authors propose that the flexible linker region in the spectrin tetramer allows it to act like a spring and maintain cell shape, and that the different mechanisms of extension and contraction allow the spectrin tetramer to restore cell shape after deformation.
The paper describes a study on how plant proteins called REM1.3, which are associated with the plasma membrane, help regulate plant defense against viral infection. The authors found that the protein REM1.3 is phosphorylated by a viral protein kinase, which in turn modulates its membrane dynamics and ability to regulate the permeability of the plasma membrane. Overexpression of REM1.3 restricts the spread of viruses, while mutations in the phosphorylation sites of REM1.3 impair its ability to restrict virus movement. The authors identified a kinase called CPK3 as the likely phosphorylating enzyme. The study suggests that REM1.3 phosphorylation may play a key role in plant defense against viruses, possibly by regulating the permeability of the plasma membrane. The study also found that REM1.3 is not altered during viral infection, but the phosphorylation of REM1.3 by CPK3 is activated by viral proteins. The study provides evidence that phosphorylation of REM proteins may be an important mechanism for plant defense against viruses and other pathogens.
The paper discusses how the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) evades immune responses by encoding two immune evasion proteins, gp34 and gp68, that bind to immune antibodies and inhibit activation of immune receptors. HCVMutants lacking these proteins show increased activation of immune receptors by immune antibodies, suggesting that gp34 and gp68 inhibit immune receptor activation. This inhibition is shown to be specific for FcγRI, FcγRIIA and FcγRI, but not FcγRIII. The study demonstrates that gp34 and gp68 are sufficient to inhibit immune responses by binding immune antibodies and that soluble versions of the proteins can inhibit immune activation as well. The results suggest that HCMV encodes multiple immune evasion proteins that target different immune receptors to evade immunity.
The paper discusses the role of a cytokine called interleukin-32 (IL-2) in regulating the immune response to two different species of Leishmania parasites that cause leishmaniasis in humans. The authors found that the IL-2 isoform IL-2γ is mainly expressed and induces the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNFα, IL-8 and IL-1β in macrophages infected with both Leishmania species. IL-2γ is also linked to the production of anti-inflammatory molecules like IL-1Ra and IL-10. The higher production of IL-2γ by Leishmania species was found to be associated with higher levels of TNFα and IL-10, which may contribute to the different clinical manifestations of the disease caused by each parasite species. The authors suggest that IL-2γ may play a key role in controlling the uptake of the parasites and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by macrophages, which could lead to different clinical outcomes. They propose that IL-2γ may be a useful target for developing new therapies for leishmaniasis.
The paper proposes a new method called "phylometabolic analysis" that combines phylogenetic and metabolic network reconstructions to study the evolution of metabolic pathways. The method uses flux balance analysis to model the metabolism of organisms and reconstructs the evolutionary history of metabolic pathways based on the distribution of enzymes across different species. The authors apply this method to the evolutionary history of carbon fixation, which involves different pathways that convert carbon dioxide into organic molecules. They show that the ancestral form of carbon fixation was likely a reductive pathway using folic acid, which was later replaced by alternative pathways that incorporated carbon dioxide directly. The paper finds that the distribution of enzymes across different species and their ecological roles explain the evolutionary history of carbon fixation pathways. The results suggest that energy optimization and oxygen sensitivity drove the emergence of different carbon fixation pathways, with reductive carbon fixation being the ancestral form. The authors propose that the ancestral form of carbon fixation was a metabolically redundant system, with multiple channels for fixing carbon, which allowed for robustness against environmental perturbations. The paper demonstrates how combining phylogenetic and metabolic reconstructions can provide new insights into the evolutionary history of metabolic pathways beyond what either approach can achieve alone.
The paper discusses the results of a study comparing the effectiveness of Esperanza Window Traps (EWTs) and human landing collections (HLCs) for collecting Simulium damnosum sensu lato, a complex of sibling species of blackflies that transmit Onchocerca volulus, the parasitic filaria responsible for onchocerciasis. The study found that while EWTs baited with CO2 and worn socks performed relatively poorly in Tanzania, they were effective in Uganda, collecting comparable numbers of the same species as HLCs. In Uganda, EWTs with blue tarpaulin baited with CO2 and worn socks collected similar numbers of S. damnosum s.l. as HLCs. However, in Tanzania, EWTs were less effective, with the exception of EWTs baited with CO2 and worn socks at one location. The paper suggests that differences in trap design, environmental conditions, and the behavior of the different sibling species of S. damnosum complex may explain the discrepancies between the two countries. Further research is needed to understand how different species respond to EWTs and how to improve their effectiveness for collecting anthropophilic blackflies for onchocercias transmission surveillance in sub-Saharan Africa.
The paper describes a study that used molecular typing techniques to analyze the bacterium Bartonella bacillis, which is the causative agent of Oroya's Fever in South America. The study aimed to perform molecular typing of Bartonella bacillis directly from blood samples in patients diagnosed with Oroya's Fever, in order to gain insights into its clonal structure and evolution. The study found that the bacterium has a high degree of genetic heterogeneity, with multiple distinct strains (or STs) identified in different regions of Peru. While the study found that the ST1 was the most common strain, it was also found to be closely related to other STs, suggesting a common ancestor colonizing the area. The study highlights the need for more research to associate specific STs with clinical symptoms and disease severity. The study demonstrates that molecular typing can be performed directly from blood samples, but has limitations in detecting polyclonal infections and low bacterial burden in asymptomatic carriers. Further studies are needed to better understand the clonal structure and genetic differences between strains that may influence disease severity.
This paper compares the genomes of two closely related fungal species, Mycosphaerella graminicola and Mycosphaerella subspecies 1 (S1), which infect wheat and other grasses respectively. The study finds that the genomes of the two species have diverged significantly over the last 1000 years, with the smaller chromosomes (dispensable chromosomes) showing more structural changes and more pseudogenes, indicating that these chromosomes are not homologous to the larger chromosomes in M. graminicola. The dispensable chromosomes have a smaller effective population size, which leads to less genetic diversity and faster evolution. The study also finds that genes involved in host-pathogen interactions and specialization show evidence of positive selection, while genes involved in reproductive isolation show evidence of selection. The study suggests that the recent emergence of M. graminicola as a specialized wheat pathogen was associated with genomic changes on the smallest chromosomes, while the larger chromosomes have maintained a high degree of identity between the two species. The findings suggest that the genome divergence of the two species exceeded the molecular evolution at the nucleotide level and that the speciation of M. graminicola and S1 occurred over a longer period of time than previously estimated. The study provides insights into the evolutionary processes that led to the emergence of specialized fungal pathogens and highlights the importance of genome plasticity in fungal speciation.
This paper proposes a framework to understand how the brain uses information from different brain areas to make decisions. It argues that the brain likely uses a suboptimal decoding strategy that combines information from multiple areas in a way that is not optimal. This framework allows researchers to analyze data from experiments that measure how neuronal activity changes when certain brain areas are inactivated, and how this affects behavioral performance. The framework can be used to determine which brain areas contribute the most to behavioral performance. The paper shows how this framework can explain experimental results from macaque monkeys performing a heading discrimination task, where neurons in one area were found to predict behavioral performance better than another area. The framework suggests that the brain likely uses a suboptimal decoding strategy that combines information from multiple areas, but this allows the brain to extract more information from the available noise.
The paper discusses a model to study the different ways that the influenza virus can spread through the air. It shows that depending on the specific situation, one or more of the following modes of transmission may be dominant: respiratory, droplet, contact, and direct droplet transmission. The model highlights that factors such as the host's density, the virus's infectivity, and the shedding rate can influence which mode dominates. It suggests that in some cases, contact transmission may not be the best intervention method since hand hygiene may not be effective if there is enough virus in the air that can re-contaminate hands. The model provides insights into how to identify the most important transmission modes in specific settings and which interventions would be most effective. It argues that a single transmission mode intervention may not be effective in all situations, as the dominant mode may vary depending on factors such as the host, virus and environment. The work provides recommendations for future empirical studies to better understand transmission modes and inform intervention strategies.
The paper discusses the association between Fasciola hepatica, a parasite that causes liver fluke infection, and liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and cancer. The authors conducted a systematic review of studies on Fasciola infection and liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and cancer. They found that there is evidence of an association between Fasciola and liver fibrosis in animal models, case reports, and case series, but no population-based studies have been conducted to assess the relationship between Fasciola and liver disease in humans. The authors suggest that the lack of population studies may be due to limited access to healthcare in endemic areas where Fasciola is common. The review highlights the potential for Fasciola infection to cause liver fibrosis and cirrhosis through activation of hepatic stellate cells, and induction of genetic mutations. However, the evidence of Fasciola-related cancer is limited and no conclusions can be drawn due to the lack of human and animal studies showing such an association. The authors suggest that future population studies are needed to assess the relationship between Fasciola and liver disease in endemic populations to prevent complications from this infection.
The paper discusses a new approach to target cancer cells using a combination of two drugs: asTORi, which inhibits the mTORC1 protein, and oncolytic HSV1, a virus that can selectively infect cancer cells. The researchers found that asTORi treatment initially suppresses global protein synthesis in normal cells, but cancer cells with a dysregulated eIF4E/4E-BP ratio can sustain viral protein synthesis. In cancer cells, asTORi treatment initially represses viral protein synthesis but eventually allows viral protein production to persist, which can be augmented by oncolytic HSV1. The combination of asTORi and oncolytic HSV1 could potentially target cancer cells with altered eIF4E/4E-B ratios that are resistant to asTORi-induced cell arrest. The approach could potentially selectively target cancer cells with high eIF4E expression, but more studies are needed to confirm this. The authors propose that a transient or localized asTORi therapy during early viral replication could reduce cancer cell proliferation and induce a subsequent immune response.
Here is a one paragraph summary of the paper:  This paper conducted a systematic review to examine how well mass drug administration (MDA) programs for schistosomiasis in sub-Saharan Africa achieved coverage among school-age children (SAC). The studies showed that combined community and school-based approaches had the highest coverage rates, achieving median coverage of 7-95% for SAC. Community-only delivery was the next highest, followed by school-only delivery. However, coverage was consistently lower among non-enrolled children compared to enrolled children. The World Health Organization recommends achieving 75% coverage for schistosomiasis-endemic areas. The review found that factors such as fear of side effects, lack of education, low motivation of drug distributors, unequal distribution and local political tensions impacted MDA coverage. Based on these findings, the authors suggest several strategies to improve coverage rates including providing food to treated children, educational campaigns, training drug distributors, and inclusive program design. The review highlights the importance of achieving high coverage among both enrolled and non-enrolled children to ensure no persistently untreated subpopulation within the community for eventual elimination of transmission. While the study had limitations due to heterogeneity in study design and reporting, it provides a first look at how to design effective MDA programs and highlights factors that can maximize coverage.
The paper describes a case of a single gene incompatibility between two alleles at the same locus in Arabidopsis thaliana that causes a range of developmental abnormalities, including smaller stature, leaf twisting, and ectopic outgrowths on the petioles. The causal gene, OUTGROWTH-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN KINASE (OAK), is a receptor-like kinase that is part of a highly variable tandem array of related genes. The promoter region of the OAK gene was duplicated in the ancestral state, which led to the formation of a new promoter that changed the expression domain from the leaf lamina to the leaf petiole. The two alleles of OAK behave in an overdominant fashion, causing the abnormalities when expressed together, but behave in an underdominant fashion when expressed in heterozygosity in the same genetic background. The high variability of the OAK gene cluster and its tandem array suggests that it may have evolved through gene conversion and duplication events. The authors propose that the change in expression domain may have altered the affinity of the OAK proteins for their ligands, leading to ectopic activation of downstream signaling pathways and developmental abnormalities. This case highlights the potential for single gene incompatibilities to contribute to speciation through underdominance or sterility in hybrids, even if the genetic changes occur within separate genetic backgrounds.
The paper describes a simple agent-based model of yeast colonies that considers processes like budding, cell death, mating, cell size and age. The model shows that different budding patterns of haploid cells, either axial or random, affect the efficiency of mating and the distribution of cells in the colony. The axial budding pattern allows cells to mate more efficiently in the early stages of colony growth, while the bipolar pattern allows for better expansion of the colony under nutrient limitations. The mating type switch frequency also affects the trade-off between efficient diploidization and inbreeding. As cells age, the mating probability of colonies initiated by old cells declines, but eventually recovers as rejuvenated offspring become the majority. The model shows that cellular aging does not significantly affect the overall distribution of cells within the colony, but does impact the mating efficiency. The model provides a simple framework to study the development of yeast colonies and can be extended to include more biological details like cell morphology changes. While it has limitations due to computational cost, it can serve as a useful starting point for further research on multicellular organisms.
The paper discusses how the disability-adjusted life year (DALY) metric, commonly used to estimate the global burden of disease, has limitations when applied to neglected tropical diseases like African trypanosomiasis (HAT). The DALY metric does not adequately capture the spatial and temporal variation in HAT burden, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. HAT is focally transmitted and has high burden in affected communities, but national estimates of HAT burden are low, which hinders prioritization of interventions. The authors estimate the DALY burden for HAT in Uganda at a sub-national level using data from 284 HAT cases, with stage-specific disability weightings and mortality rates. They find that the majority of the burden comes from years of life lost, rather than years of life lived with disability. The DALY estimates are sensitive to the proportion of unreported cases, which is significant for HAT, particularly for rhodesiense HAT. The study highlights the importance of sub-national burden estimates to better account for the underreported burden of HAT, particularly in areas with high focal transmission. The paper concludes that sub-national burden estimates can identify areas of high burden and prioritize targeted interventions. The DALY metric is a useful tool but needs to be revised to better capture spatial and temporal variation in disease burden, particularly for focal diseases like HAT.
The paper describes a new method to quickly identify both ticks and the bacteria that cause Lyme disease (Borrelia) within the ticks using a technique called Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). The researchers developed a database of protein profiles for 14 different Borrelia species using cultured isolates and then tested the method on infected ticks. They found that they could identify the bacteria and the specific ticks that carried them (Borrelia crocidiae) within 45 minutes using the MALDI-TOF-MS technique. This method allows for the rapid identification of both the ticks and the bacteria, which could potentially be useful for detecting Lyme disease in the field. The researchers also found that the bacteria could be identified in infected ticks without any negative impact to the ticks' ability to be identified.
The paper discusses the role of type I interferons (IFNs) and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) in the immune response to the influenza virus (IAV) infection in mice. The authors found that type I IFNs are necessary but not sufficient to control the full scale of pulmonary inflammation in response to IAV infection. They discovered that type I IFNs play a dual role in regulating both monocyte and neutrophil trafficking in the lungs, suppressing monocyte-driven inflammation while promoting inflammatory macrophage activation. They found that monocytes are classified into two subsets, Ly6Chi and Ly6Clo, and that Ly6Clo monocytes are more susceptible to type I IFN-mediated suppression. They showed that type I IFNs regulate monocyte migration by suppressing the expression of MHCII on Ly6Clo monocytes, which in turn reduces the accumulation of neutrophils in the lungs. They also found that IFN-γ promotes the activation of Ly6Clo monocytes, which produces pro-inflammatory molecules. The authors conclude that type I IFNs and IFN-γ signaling work together to coordinate a multifaceted pulmonary inflammatory response to IAV infection, with type I IFNs playing a more active role in regulating monocyte trafficking while IFN-γ playing a role in monocyte activation. They suggest that dysregulation of IFN signaling pathways may contribute to disease and viral transmission. Overall, the study highlights the importance of the interplay between innate and adaptive immune systems in protecting against IAV infection.
The paper describes a computational method called CoVote to identify the core promoter regions of microRNA genes in four model species: C. elegans, H. sapiens, A. thaliana, and O. sativa. The method uses a discriminative model to determine whether a given sequence is a pol II promoter, pol III promoter or random sequence based on features from known microRNA genes and protein-coding genes. The results show that most microRNA genes in these species have the same promoters as protein-coding genes, and that CoVote is able to accurately identify the core promoters of most known microRNA genes. The analysis of the predicted microRNA genes found that CT repeats are conserved across all species and are important for transcriptional regulation. Motifs specific to each species were also identified and may play important roles in the regulation of microRNA genes. The results provide genome-wide evidence that most microRNA genes are transcribed by pol II and extend previous studies showing that a few microRNA genes are transcribed by pol III. The method and results provide useful insights into the transcriptional regulation of microRNAs.
The paper discusses a new finding that a protein domain called DUF120, which is highly duplicated in the human genome, is associated with increasing symptom severity in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Specifically, the researchers found that individuals with ASD tend to have more copies of a particular subtype of DUF120 called CON1, which is found in the 1q21 region. They used droplet digital polymerase chain reaction to measure the number of copies of DUF120 in individuals and found that increasing the number of CON1 copies was associated with increasing severity of the core symptoms of ASD, such as social, communication and repetitive behaviors, as measured by standardized clinical tools. This suggests that DUF120 may play a role in the pathogenesis of ASD, potentially by affecting the rate of neurogenesis and leading to too many poorly connected neurons. The study highlights the importance of looking at genetic variants in previously unexamined parts of the genome for ASD etiology and implies that both genetic and epigenetic factors may contribute to the disease. The findings provide a new direction for research into the genetic factors underlying ASD and the role of brain evolution in the disorder.
This paper studies the origin of beer yeast strains and their relation to other yeast species. The researchers find that beer strains are polyploid, meaning they have more than two sets of chromosomes, and have undergone admixture with related yeast populations. They sequence the genomes of 47 beer and other yeast strains and find that beer strains have a hybrid origin between European and Asian yeast populations. The admixture occurred before the beer strains became polyploid, and resulted in a mix of European and Asian alleles. The beer strains have a mix of European and Asian alleles at heterozygous sites, indicating that the alleles were inherited from an ancestral population that split from either the European or Asian population. The beer strains have a mix of European and Asian alleles at other sites, indicating that admixture occurred between the two populations. The researchers also find that loss of heterozygosity through mitotic gene conversion and recombination has occurred in the beer strains, leading to diversification. This study suggests that beer yeast strains are the product of admixture between different domesticated populations, and not just a single ancestral population.
The paper discusses the results of a study analyzing the immune response to the malaria parasite Plasmodium in a population in India using protein microarray technology. The study found that the most immunogenic antigens are those that are exposed on the surface of the parasite during its intraerythrocytic stages, such as PfEMP1, RESA, ETRAMP, PHISTc, Hsp70x, GEXP18, and MSP2, MSP1, SERA4. These proteins were recognized with higher intensity by individuals with asymptomatic malaria infections compared to those with symptomatic infections. However, antibody-mediated immunity to Plasmodium vivax, which is more prevalent in India, was found to have a lower contribution in asymptomatic infections compared to symptomatic infections. This suggests that immunity to Plasmodium vivax is primarily mediated by regulatory cytokines rather than an immune response. The findings suggest that immunity to Plasmodium falciparum, which is more pyrogenic, is associated with a broad and intense antibody response. The study provides insights into the immune response to Plasmodium in India and could inform the development of vaccines and surveillance tools for malaria control.
The paper describes the genome sequencing and annotation of the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, a small insect that feeds on plant sap and has complex life cycles involving parthenogenesis and facultative associations with bacterial symbionts. The researchers used whole genome shotgun sequencing and assembly to produce a draft genome sequence and assembled it using different software. They also manually curated gene models to generate a comprehensive gene prediction set and analyzed the genome for transcription evidence and orthology to other insect genomes. They found that 40% of Aphid genes could be annotated based on clear orthology relationships with Drosophila genes and 23% presented many-to-one relationships with annotated Drosophila genes. The remaining genes were considered in-paralogs. They also identified telomeres in the Aphid genome and characterized transposable elements. The paper provides a draft genome sequence and a comprehensive annotation of the genes, transcripts, and other features of the Aphid genome, which will help researchers explore the genetic basis of the Aphid's complex ecology and development.
The paper discusses how plant species with different life cycles (annual and perennial) have different genetic mechanisms for regulating flowering time. In the annual species Arabidopsis thaliana, the gene FLOWERING LOCUS (FLC) regulates flowering in response to vernalization. In perennial species like Arabidopsis alpina, the gene PERIORIOR flowering specific gene (PEP1) regulates flowering. The authors found that some A. alpina accessions do not require vernalization to flower and instead flower perpetually. They identified five accessions that showed natural variation in flowering time, some of which were caused by loss of function alleles of the PEP1 gene. The PEP1 gene is partially duplicated in A. alpina, which likely contributes to the differences in flowering time regulation between annual and perennial species. The PEP1 gene has two overlapping transcripts generated by two transcription start sites, which may allow it to contribute to a broader range of regulatory pathways. The study suggests that loss of function alleles of PEP1 are responsible for natural variation in flowering time in perennial species, rather than allelic variation at the FLC gene.
The paper describes the isolation and characterization of an antibody fragment that specifically binds to the dengue virus (DENV) NS3 helicase domain. The antibody fragment, named 3F8, was isolated from a phage display library using a dengue virus NS3 protein as the antigen. The antibody fragment was found to bind the NS3 helicase domain with high affinity and specificity and was able to inhibit the NS3 helicase and ATPase activities. The inhibition of NS3 activities reduced dengue virus replication in infected cells. The epitope of the antibody fragment was mapped to residues 526-53 in the third alpha helix of the NS3 helicase domain. The antibody fragment was found to cross-react with all four DENV serotypes, indicating it could be a useful tool for studying dengue virus replication and potentially developing therapeutics. However, transporting the antibody into cells through the cell membrane is a major challenge that would need to be overcome for clinical use. The authors suggest approaches like coupling the antibody with a transport protein or expressing it as an intracellular protein using gene therapy vectors may help overcome this hurdle.
This paper investigates the relationship between the genetic mutations in colorectal cancer tumors and the microbiome. The researchers used whole-exome sequencing on 8 colorectal tumors and paired normal tissue samples from 4 patients to identify genetic mutations in the tumors. They found that the composition of the microbiome surrounding the tumors correlates with the genetic mutations in the tumors. Specifically, certain microbial taxa are more abundant in tumors with specific genetic mutations. They used a machine learning algorithm to predict the presence of genetic mutations based on the microbiome composition. They found that the microbiome can be used to predict the presence of genetic mutations in certain genes, particularly those related to the Wnt signaling pathway. They suggest that the genetic mutations may affect the microbiome and the microbiome in turn, leading to the correlations they observed. They propose using the microbiome composition as a predictor of genetic mutations in colorectal cancer tumors.
This paper explores how social insects like ants use specialization of tasks to increase efficiency in performing tasks. The researchers found that worker ants specialize tasks based on their age and physiology, with young workers tending to brood care and old workers taking over foraging. They identified a gene called Vg-like A that is highly expressed in brood carers and appears to influence this specialization. When they experimentally knocked down the expression of Vg-like A in ants, young workers failed to switch to foraging tasks, suggesting that the gene is required for young workers to specialize. However, old workers were able to switch back to brood care when needed, indicating that Vg-like A expression is influenced by social cues rather than just age. The researchers conclude that Vg-like A is involved in mediating responsiveness to social stimuli and helps explain how ants achieve age-dependent behavioral progression and flexibility. The gene expression and knockdown experiments provide evidence for a mechanism by which ants can specialize tasks based on age and physiology, but the gene itself does not directly control the steps beyond brood care.
The paper proposes a computational model for how the brain controls coordinated eye and head movements during saccades. The model consists of two parts: a feedforward controller and an adaptation mechanism. The feedforward controller performs a spatial-temporal transformation to convert desired gaze shifts into neural control signals for the eye and head. The adaptation mechanism modifies the weights of the controller through a gradient descent algorithm to minimize a cost function that measures the total error between the desired gaze shift and the actual gaze shift. The cost function does not directly depend on the saccadic duration, allowing for a local learning mechanism that can adapt the controller parameters incrementally. The model is able to generate coordinated eye and head movements in both head-restrained and head-free conditions, reproducing experimental results. The adaptation mechanism is speculated to be based on the cerebellum, possibly through the ventral paraflocculus area or the superior colliculus. The paper highlights the benefits of using an incremental learning mechanism to adapt the controller parameters, allowing the model to generate motor commands immediately after the saccades. The paper also suggests that the neural forward models used by the adaptation mechanism could be learned through temporal sequence learning.
The paper compares the effectiveness and safety of two common antibiotics, ofloxacin and gatifloxacin, for treating enteric fever in areas where there is a high prevalence of nalidixic acid-resistant Salmonella Typhi and S. Paratyphi A strains. The researchers found that while ofloxacin was effective in treating enteric fever, it had slower fever resolution compared to gatifloxacin, which had a median fever clearance time of 3.3 days compared to 4.7 days for patients infected with nalidic acid-resistant isolates. The researchers suggest that the slower resolution of fever with ofloxacin may be due to different pharmacokinetics between the two antibiotics. However, they note that patients and their caregivers consider the prompt resolution of fever to be an important issue in favor of gatifloxacin, and that prolonged fever clearance times have been linked to microbiological failure and increased relapse rates when using older fluoroquinolones like ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin. The study highlights the challenges of conducting clinical trials in enteric fever, particularly the varying definitions of efficacy outcomes and the low sensitivity of microbiological blood culture. The researchers conclude that adequately-dosed gatifloxac or ofloxacin would still be effective options for empirically treating undifferentiated fever in areas with high rates of nalidixic acid-resistance, but gatifloxacin has advantages in terms of faster symptom resolution for young, otherwise healthy patients.
The paper discusses why the plague, a highly virulent disease caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis, persists in some areas despite being transmitted by rodents and fleas. The authors show that two factors are important: the presence of resistant rodents and the spatial structure of the rodent populations. Without resistant rodents, the disease can only persist in small populations, but with resistant rodents, the disease can persist in larger populations. The presence of spatial structure allows the disease to persist for decades even in larger populations, as long as there is enough subdivision between subpopulations. This suggests that both factors, host resistance and spatial structure, are important in maintaining plague in some areas. In Madagascar, the highlands where the disease persists, the rat populations are more genetically structured and colonized by highland rats from coastal areas, which may have led to the evolution of resistance. This synergistic effect of host resistance and population structure may have maintained the disease in the highlands. The authors propose that plague persistence in Madagascar may be due to different parameters in the highlands and lowlands, with the highland populations having higher transmission rates and more resistance to the disease. However, further studies are needed to test this hypothesis and assess the parameters in the lowlands. The paper highlights the importance of considering both host resistance and spatial structure when studying plague endemism.
This paper investigates how the spatial organization of time delays between brain regions affects the phase relations between signals from distant brain areas. The authors analyze the phase lag between signals from different brain regions as a way to study the synchronization between these regions. They find that the distribution of phase lags depends on the time delays and coupling strength between the regions. Stronger brain regions generally lag behind weaker regions, especially during anti-phase synchronization. The distribution of phase lags also depends on the frequency of synchronization, with stronger connections resulting in wider phase lags. The authors show that the phase lag distribution is affected by the organization of the network, with stronger connections leading to wider phase lags. The results indicate that the distribution of phase lags is not uniform and can be affected by non-stationarity in the brain signals. The study highlights the importance of accounting for the non-stationarity and variability in analyzing phase lag data in the brain.
The paper describes how the hepatitis C virus (HCV) was adapted to use the mouse CD81 entry factor for entry into mouse cells instead of the human CD81 factor. The HCV genome was modified through reverse genetics to introduce mutations into the E1 and E2 proteins that made it more efficient at using mouse CD81. This adaptation allowed the virus to infect mouse cells that were previously unable to be infected by HCV. The mutations were found to increase the binding of the CD81 protein to the virus and also reduce the threshold CD81 receptor level required for infection. The adapted virus was then tested for entry into mouse cells and was found to be able to infect cells that expressed human CD81 but not mouse CD81. The study suggests that the adaptation of HCV to use mouse CD81 may be an effective way to overcome the species barrier between humans and mice and allow for the growth of HCV in mouse cells. This could potentially be used to develop mouse models for studying HCV infection and vaccine development.
This paper identifies two cellular kinases, Pim-1 and Pim-3, as key regulators of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) reactivation from latency. The authors show that these kinases phosphorylate a protein called LANA, which represses expression of lytic genes by binding to the viral enhancer regions. Phosphorylation of LANA by Pim-1 and -3 counteracts this repression, allowing the expression of lytic genes. The authors analyze the requirement of Pim-1 and -3 for KSHV reactivation in cell culture and find that expression of these kinases is sufficient to induce reactivation, and that depletion of either kinase leads to significant reduction in reactivation. They also demonstrate that Pim-1 and -3 are required for KSHV reactivation in naturally infected PEL cells. The results suggest that cellular signaling pathways operative during viral reactivation could represent potential novel targets for therapeutic intervention.
This paper describes a new role for the protein LAB-1 in establishing and maintaining sister chromatid cohesion during meiosis in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. The authors found that LAB-1 is required for proper loading and maintenance of the cohesin complex, which is necessary for proper chromosome segregation during meiosis. They showed that LAB-1 localizes to chromosomes throughout prophase I and metaphase I and interacts with the phosphatase PP1, which antagonizes Aurora B phosphorylation activity. LAB-1 depletion leads to reduced sister chromatid cohesion and homologous pairing, altered meiotic recombination, and increased apoptosis. The results suggest that LAB-1 plays a central role in regulating the establishment and maintenance of sister chromatid cohesion throughout prophase I, from the onset of meiosis through homolog segregation at the metaphase I transition. The authors propose that LAB-1 may act to restrict the ability of Aurora B to remove cohesin during early meiosis by targeting PP1 homologs to chromosome axes, thereby maintaining sister chromatid cohesion. This mechanism may be conserved across monocentric and holocentric organisms. The study reveals key principles of how proteins regulate meiotic sister chromatid cohesion.
The paper investigates the role of the histone modification H3K9me2 in cellular differentiation. The authors find that H3K9me2 is already highly prevalent in embryonic stem cells, indicating that the mechanisms that mediate this modification are active in stem cells and serve similar functions as in somatic cells. However, while somatic cells show a slight increase of H3K9me2 during differentiation, the gain occurs very localized at gene bodies and does not necessarily coincide with lower transcription of the corresponding genes. The analysis of regions that acquire H3K9me2 during differentiation reveals that the modification only modulates gene repression locally and does not play a major role in setting up gene expression programs. The findings challenge a model that massive heterochromatinization occurs during differentiation via a global increase in repressive histone marks and repression of basal gene activity. The study suggests that local epigenetic changes at regulatory regions specify and stabilize lineage specification and terminal differentiation, and that repressive chromatin can be overcome by local activity of transcription factors during normal differentiation.
The paper investigates how people integrate evidence over a period of time to make decisions. They found that when people are presented with longer stimuli lasting 1-3 seconds, they show a non-monotonic temporal weighting profile, where both early and late evidence are influential. This is inconsistent with existing models that predict monotonic temporal weighting. The authors propose a new model called the dynamic leaky competing accumulator (DLA) that can account for this non-monotonic weighting. The DLA model shows that during the trial, leak and inhibition parameters increase and decrease, allowing the model to transition from a primacy-dominant regime to a recency-dominant regime. This allows the model to display a richer, duration-dependent weight profile. The DLA model can predict the observed non-monotonic temporal weighting and primacy weights for shorter durations and monotonic recency weights for longer durations. While the results suggest a dynamic accumulation mechanism, alternative accounts like adaptation or arousal fluctuations may also contribute. The findings provide insights into how people integrate evidence over a longer time scale and how neural mechanisms may mediate this process.
The paper compares how different types of immune cells in the lungs of healthy individuals respond to different strains of influenza viruses. The researchers found that macrophages (MM) respond differently than alveolar macrophages (AM) when infected with the different strains. Macrophages are more susceptible to infection and produce more cytokines than AM. AM are more abundantly infected by highly pathogenic strains (H5N1) than seasonal strains (H3N2 or pH1N1). This suggests that the AM may play a role in limiting the severity of disease, but their response to HPAIV H5N1 is different than previously thought. The AM response is more muted and does not contribute to excessive inflammation. The researchers conclude that MM may be a better model for studying the interaction between immune cells and influenza virus.
This paper describes a genome-scale RNA interference (RNAi) screen to identify genes involved in repairing double strand breaks in DNA. The researchers used an enzyme called I-SceI to induce double strand breaks in human cells and then co-transfected the cells with RNA interfering genes that either increased or decreased the ability of the cells to repair the breaks. They found 61 genes that significantly affected the ability of the cells to repair the breaks, with known roles in DNA repair. They then further analyzed the genes that decreased repair and found that one gene, KIAA0415, was associated with hereditary spastic paraplegia. They identified a mutation in KIAA0415 in two patients with spastic paraplegia and showed that cells from these patients were more sensitive to DNA damaging drugs. The authors propose that impaired DNA repair may be a contributing factor to hereditary spastic paraplegia, adding to the growing list of neurodegenerative diseases caused by DNA repair deficiencies. The study demonstrates the power of using RNAi screens to identify genes involved in DNA repair and how structural bioinformatics can help prioritize the analysis of uncharacterized genes.
The paper describes a proof-of-concept study using 16S metagenomics to identify bacteria in the blood of severely ill children in Burkina Faso. The researchers found that 16S metagenomics detected clinically significant bacteria in 24% of the patients, while blood culture detected only 16% of the patients. The 16S metagenomics assay also detected bacteria in 10 patients that were negative by blood culture, suggesting that it is more sensitive than blood culture. They found that children with acute malaria or recently recovered from malaria were more likely to carry multiple bacteria in their blood, which may contribute to their poor clinical outcome. The researchers suggest that the combination of blood culture and 16S metagenomics has a higher sensitivity to identify bacterial blood stream infections. However, the study had some limitations, including the small sample size and the difficulty in distinguishing environmental contaminants from clinically relevant bacteria. The study demonstrates the potential of 16S metagenomics to complement blood culture in diagnosing bacterial blood stream infections, but more work is needed to overcome these limitations and improve specificity and reproducibility.
The paper discusses how vector control could be an effective way to help eliminate Gambian HAT (African trypanosomiasis) in areas where it is prevalent. Currently, case detection and treatment are the main methods used, but they have limitations as they only cover a small percentage of the population and often leave infected individuals untreated. The paper describes a new method using small, cheap targets that are easy to deploy along rivers and have been shown to effectively reduce tsetse fly populations. The authors argue that vector control could be an important addition to case detection and treatment to achieve elimination of Gambian HAT. They estimate that 5 years of vector control would be required to achieve this, starting during the dry season when tset populations are at their lowest. They suggest that vector control could be organized at the local level with local personnel working with external support and training, and that once effective control is achieved, external support could be gradually phased out.
The paper presents a new tool called CE-Symm that can detect internal symmetry in protein structures. It can identify repeating units within a protein chain and describe their arrangement as a multiple alignment of repeats. The tool can identify different types of internal symmetry, including closed and open symmetry, and even hierarchical symmetries. It can also detect higher-order symmetries by recursively analyzing structures with multiple axes of symmetry. The tool can provide information about the type and order of symmetry, and align repeats between repeats. The authors found that internal symmetry is common in protein structures and is often associated with functional consequences, such as conserved binding sites and uneven stoichiometry. However, the tool still has limitations, including that it cannot detect quaternary symmetry and some conformational changes. The authors hope to integrate quaternary detection into CE-Symm in the future. They also hope to make the tool more widely available to researchers.
The paper discusses how changes in histone acetylation patterns reflect changes in gene expression in embryonic stem cells during differentiation. The authors analyze gene expression and histone acetylation data from a mouse embryonic stem cell differentiation experiment and find that histone acetylation profiles remain stable over time while gene expression changes. However, gene expression changes are more pronounced than histone acetylation changes, especially for down-regulated genes. The authors find that genes that play key roles in embryonic stem cell self-renewal show high levels of histone acetylation, indicating they are located at open chromatin regions. They also find that the coordination between histone acetylation and gene expression increases over time. The authors conclude that histone acetylation reflects chromatin structure changes and is predictive of gene expression changes, but the relationship between the two is complex and changes over time. The findings suggest that histone acetylation is more important for non-transcriptional regulation of embryonic stem cells than previously thought and that the link between histone acetylation and gene expression is mediated by mechanisms beyond transcription factors.
This paper studies the evolution of sticky cells in the context of bacterial surface colonization. Bacteria often form colonies on surfaces, where cells express different adhesive phenotypes that allow for surface attachment and organization. The paper simulates the evolution of a "sticky" cell type in a dynamic environment where cells can switch between living on the surface and in the liquid. The model shows that under most conditions, surface colonization evolves and is associated with phenotypic heterogeneity, where cells expressing the sticky phenotype can colonize the surface while non-sticky cells cannot. Three different different strategies for cell differentiation are considered: a pure strategy where cells consistently express the same phenotype, a probabilistic strategy where cells differentiate with a probability, and a decision-making strategy where cells differentiate in response to environmental cues. The decision-making strategy evolves the highest fraction of sticky cells on the surface, but at the cost of sacrificing cell division rate. Cells in the decision-making strategy cooperate by dividing their labors and allowing the sticky cell to sacrifice its fitness for the benefit of the colony. The paper finds that at low costs of being sticky, colonies form filamentous structures that can expand and reproduce by colony fission and propagule production. At higher costs, the filamentous growth disappears and more space becomes available for surface colonization of propagules. At very low costs and high migration rates, colony reproduction fails due to exploitation by non-sticky cells from the liquid. The model shows that life cycles can evolve with different properties, such as colony expansion, longevity and propagule production, depending on the differentiation strategy. The study highlights how the dynamical environment in which bacteria live allows cells to alternate between surface and liquid attachment and how spatial and temporal organization can come about through coordinating behavior.
The paper discusses a new mechanism of DNA methylation called disiRNA loci DNA methylation (DLDM) that is different from the known DNA methylation in Neurospora. Most known DNA methylation occurs in regions derived from repetitive DNA sequences called RIP (relics) and relies on histone methyltransfer enzymes. In contrast, DLDM occurs in gene-rich regions called disiRNA loci that lack relics and is triggered by convergent transcription. DLDM is dynamic, with DNA methylation peaking at regions of high disiRNA expression and low levels outside of disiRNA loci. The methylation requires histone methyltransfer DIM-5, but is not required for maintenance of H3K9 methylation. DLDM is also dependent on transcription at the disiRNA loci, with disiRNA production and methylation correlated. The authors show that disiRNA loci are associated with high levels of DNA methylation at their promoter regions, where disiRNA expression peaks. They propose that DLDM is involved in suppressing promiscuous transcription at the promoter region during transcriptional initiation and may be a mechanism for strengthening the directionality of sense and antisense transcription.
The study investigated how Schistosoma haematobium infection affects the function of dendritic cells (DC) in the blood of infected individuals. DC are important immune cells that help initiate immune responses and present antigens to T cells. The study found that DC isolated from infected individuals had reduced expression of HLA-DR, CD80, and CD40 molecules compared to DC from uninfected individuals. This reduction in surface markers was associated with reduced responses to TLR ligands, indicating a general impairment in TLR responsiveness. DC from infected individuals also had reduced ability to prime T cell responses, which may be due to reduced HLA-DR expression. The study suggests that Schistosoma antigens may directly modulate DC function in vivo, likely through engagement of certain TLRs, and chronic Schistosoma infection may also attenuate DC function indirectly through regulatory immune responses. The findings provide evidence that chronic Schistosoma infection leads to a general impairment in DC function, which may have implications for immune responses against the parasite itself as well as concurrent infections.
The paper describes a method for understanding the evolution of the influenza virus within an individual host, based on time-resolved sequence data collected from within a single infection. The method uses a quasispecies model of viral evolution and a hierarchical set of models of selection to infer the evolutionary scenario that best explains the observed sequence data. The quasispecies model describes the viral population as a frequency vector at discrete times, spanning a limited set of loci. The authors found that selection was identified at six populations, with evidence for time-dependent and simultaneous selection acting at multiple loci. They found that synonymous mutations were under selection, but non-synonymous mutations were more likely to be linked and under selection. The results suggest that within-host evolution of the virus is complex and influenced by interactions between different loci. The method differs from other approaches in that it considers data collected at multiple times within a single infection and allows for the evolutionary landscape to vary between animals or within a single animal over time. The results can help understand the within-host dynamics of the virus and the impact of selection on transmission. However, the method is limited by assumptions about the accuracy of the sequencing data and the continuity of the viral populations.
This paper estimates the impact of scaling up interventions to prevent malaria in pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa. The authors analyze data on malaria transmission, resistance to malaria drugs, and current intervention coverage to estimate the number of pregnancies at risk of malaria and the potential lives saved if coverage of interventions were increased. They find that while transmission has declined in recent years, malaria remains a major public health burden, particularly in areas where resistance to the main malaria drug sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine has emerged. Only 23% of pregnancies in sub-Saharan Africa currently receive two or more doses of the drug, leaving 7.1 million women who could potentially benefit from regular administration of the drug. The authors estimate that scaling up coverage to match current antenatal care attendance would avert 21,000 lives in the absence of ITN use, and 16,000 lives in areas where the drug remains effective, representing a 25% reduction in potential lives lost due to malaria. The findings suggest that while ITNs are currently providing some protection, expanding coverage of interventions like sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine would likely lead to substantial gains in preventing malaria-related lives lost in the majority of malaria-endemic areas.
This paper presents the results of a genome-wide association study of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common endocrine disorder in reproductive-aged women. The study analyzed genetic data from over 10,000 cases and 100,000 controls of European ancestry to identify genetic variants associated with the syndrome. The study found 14 genetic variants associated with PCOS, including three novel variants. The variants were found to be equally associated with different diagnostic criteria for PCOS, including the National Institutes of Health (NIH) criteria and the Rotterdam criteria. The variants were also associated with various PCOS-related traits such as hyperandrogenism, oligomenorrhoea, and polycystic ovarian morphology. The study suggests that the genetic underpinnings of PCOS implicate neuroendocrine, metabolic and reproductive pathways. There is shared genetic architecture between PCOS and various metabolic disorders, menopause, depression and male-pattern balding. The findings demonstrate the power of genetic and genomic approaches to elucidate the pathophysiology of PCOS.
The paper investigates the role of the SsbB protein in Streptococococcus pneumoniae, a bacteria that can transform its DNA by recombination. The authors find that the protein, SsbB, stabilizes internalized DNA, particularly at high concentrations of DNA, which is important for chromosomal transformation. They show that inactivating SsbB leads to a reduction in chromosomal transformation, while the truncated SsbB protein, SsbBΔ, stabilizes the internalized DNA. The authors propose that the evolutionary reason for SsbB's high abundance in S. pneumoniae is to maintain a reservoir of internalized DNA, allowing the bacteria to perform multiple rounds of recombination and create new combinations of mutations, contributing to its genetic plasticity. They conclude that SsbB plays a key role in optimizing chromosomal transformation in S. pneumoniae, though its role in Bacteroides subtilis and other transformable species remains to be established.
The paper describes the identification and characterization of genes involved in iron uptake and storage in the fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigus. The authors found that Aspergillus lacks specific genes for heme-containing transferrin or ferritin iron storage, but uses two low-affinity iron-specific chelators (siderophores) instead. They identified four genes that encode enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of different types of chelators, including a nonribosomal peptide synthetase and acetyltransferase. Deletion of these genes resulted in attenuation of virulence in mice, indicating that both intra- and extracellular chelators are required for full pathogenicity. The extracellular chelators were found to be more important for conidial iron storage and growth under iron-depleted conditions, while the intracellular chelators were more important for germination and resistance to oxidative stress. The extracellular chelator Hydroxyferrocin was also identified as a novel conidial iron storage compound. The results suggest that the ability to obtain and store iron from the host is crucial for successful infection, and that different mechanisms are employed in Aspergillus and related species. The findings provide insight into the potential therapeutic applications of targeting siderophore biosynthesis in fungal pathogens.
This paper discusses how a single transcription factor, LexA, can control the timing of promoter activity across a gene network in response to environmental stimuli. The authors engineered a series of synthetic promoters with different LexA-operator binding strengths and measured the timing of promoter activity in response to DNA damage. They found that the strength of the LexA-operator interaction determines the promoter activation threshold and timing, and not the strength of the promoter itself. They demonstrated that slow LexA binding kinetics at promoters can explain the DNA damage dose-dependent effects on promoter activity, which cannot be explained by a thermodynamic equilibrium model. The authors show that the timing of promoter activity depends on a kinetic mismatch between the rate of LexA depletion and reaccumulation within the cell and the rate of LexA dissociation/association at the promoter. This mechanism allows a single transcriptional regulator to modulate both the extent and timing of peak promoter activity across a gene network as a function of stimulus dose. The findings highlight the importance of kinetic parameters, rather than thermodynamic equilibrium parameters, in modeling gene regulation and demonstrate how a single transcription factor can control the timing of peak expression across a large gene network.
The paper shows that magpies, a common bird species in Europe, are highly susceptible to West Nile virus infection and can act as a source of transmission to mosquitoes, humans and other birds. In an experiment, magpies were infected with two strains of the virus and the results showed that all infected birds developed high levels of virus titers and neutralizing antibodies, indicating they are competent reservoirs for the virus. Magpies were found to be more susceptible than previously thought, with a mortality rate of 30% and 42.8% compared to 10% in previous studies on North American magpies. This suggests that European magpies may play a larger role in transmitting the virus than previously believed. The study found virus in feather pulps, cloacal swabs, and brains of infected birds, indicating horizontal transmission, and that magpies could act as a source of infection for other birds and possibly humans. The study suggests that magpies should be a priority for West Nile virus surveillance programs in Europe.
This paper investigated how alphaviruses, which are mosquito-borne viruses that cause sporadic outbreaks of rheumatic disease, persist in the body and cause chronic inflammatory arthropathy. The authors used a mouse model of chronic chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection to study how the virus persists and how this persistence leads to chronic inflammation and arthritis. They found that while antibodies and T cells can help control viremia, T cells play a more important role in suppressing viremia in the long term, especially when B cells are absent. B cell-deficient mice maintained relatively stable "set point" viremia that was 2 logs higher than in mice with B cells, suggesting that T cells play an important role in viremia suppression. Vaccination of B cell-deficient mice with an inactivated CHIKV vaccine provided some protection against viremia but did not completely eliminate it, suggesting that T cells are important. Persistent CHIKV RNA and protein was detected in mice even after the peak viremia had resolved, suggesting that the virus may continue to replicate in tissues. The study highlights the propensity of CHIKV to persist in vivo and the immunopathological basis of chronic CHIKV arthropathy, and suggests that T cells play a role in suppressing viremia.
The paper describes a new method called SELDOM that can infer the interactions between biological entities like proteins in a signaling pathway based on time-course data. It generates an ensemble of dynamic models that can make predictions in untested conditions by combining the predictions from individual models. The method is data-driven and does not make any assumptions about the network structure. It uses information theory, global optimization and model reduction to generate an ensemble of models. The ensemble predictions are then combined to make the final predictions. The authors tested the method on several real-world case studies and showed that it performed well, outperforming individual models and the best performers in some challenges. The method can generate cell-specific models that can guide experiments and make dynamic predictions, giving more mechanistic interpretations of the data.
The paper presents a mathematical model of a neuron that can exhibit resonance and dynamic gain. The model uses a cascade from current to voltage to spiking. The authors derive an exact expression for the linear response function of the neuron, which can be used to analyze the response properties of the neuron. They show that the dynamic gain of the neuron is constrained by the intrinsic adaptation and subthreshold resonance, and that the resonance condition depends on the voltage and spiking time constants. The paper also shows how the response function can be parameterized in a two-dimensional space of voltage and spiking frequency, allowing for different types of response shapes. The authors demonstrate how the response properties can be measured experimentally and how the model can be used to study the connection between intrinsic properties and population oscillations in neurons. The findings provide new insights into how neurons process information and how resonance and dynamic gain contribute to population firing rates.
The paper describes how researchers analyzed the tick salivary gland (SG) transcriptomes of the tick species Ixodes ricinus after infection with the bacteria Bartonella hensela. They used next generation sequencing to compare the transcriptomes of infected and non-infected ticks and identified genes that varied in expression levels. The study found that genes encoding proteins containing BPTI/Kunitz domains, which are involved in protein binding, oxidation reduction, or being integral to membranes, were up-regulated in infected ticks while genes encoding anti-complement proteins, defensins and metalloproteases were down-regulated. The gene encoding a BPTI/Kunitz type serine protease inhibitor, IrSPI, was found to be up-regulated in response to infection, and its silencing reduced the amount of bacteria in infected tick salivary glands. The study suggests that IrSPI may be a good candidate for a vaccine to reduce tick burden and transmission of Bartonella and other tick-borne pathogens. The results provide insight into the molecular interactions between ticks and bacteria and lay the foundation for further research to develop anti-tick vaccines.
The paper describes the clinical and therapeutic approaches to chronic rheumatic disorders caused by chikungunya infection (CHIK) that were observed in a 6-year retrospective study in Reunion Island. The study found that many patients experienced persistent joint and muscle pain lasting more than 3 months after an acute chikungunya infection, and some developed chronic inflammatory rheumatoid disorders (CIR) that can be diagnosed by joint destruction or deformation, peripheral inflammation, and morning stiffness. The authors recommend using a multidimensional health assessment questionnaire to evaluate the severity of the disease and individualize treatment. They found that treatment with methotrexate was effective in reducing joint inflammation and stiffness in patients with chronic inflammatory rheumatoid disorders, but the time to initiate treatment was often delayed. They emphasize the importance of early diagnosis and management to prevent joint damage and reduce the likelihood of destructive pCHIK-CIR. They propose that local inflammation in synovium and tendons due to CHIK infection may compromise the osteo-myo-articular balance and lead to degenerative changes. Further research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms of chronic CHIK disorders and to develop novel therapeutic strategies.
This paper describes a new method to visualize and analyze the structure of protein folds (the basic building blocks of proteins) in a way that can reveal how they relate to each other globally across different protein structures. The authors use different methods to generate structural alignments between pairs of protein structures, which can be used to build a network of "bridges" between structures representing the relationships between them. They find that different methods generate different networks, and that these networks agree on some broad properties of fold space like dividing it into secondary structure classes, with densely connected structures like all-α and all-β structures and more loosely connected structures like α/β and α+β. The central nodes in these networks tend to be older according to their age estimates, and are often key structural "attractors" that connect different communities within the space. The paper suggests that these bridges between structures may represent evolutionary transitions between different folds rather than simply misalignments or incorrect classification, and that analyzing them could reveal important information about the true nature of protein structure.
This paper investigates how the Leishmania parasite spreads virulence factors from its surface coat to inside host cells. The parasite has no specialized machinery to inject proteins directly into cells, so it relies on shedding its surface coat components from the parasite surface upon phagocytosis by host immune cells. The study shows that two main virulence factors, gp63 and lpg, are shed from the surface of metacyclic promastigotes and then redistributed within host cells. The researchers found that these components are transported out of the phagosome via vesicular trafficking between the phagosome and endoplasmic reticulum, rather than through the parasite-driven secretion of exosomes. The virulence factors are released from the surface coat in response to signals provided by the phagocytic environment, such as temperature and pH changes. The study identified the ER-resident Sec2b and Sec25 proteins as key players in mediating this trafficking pathway. The mechanism of shedding the surface coat and trafficking the virulence factors beyond the phagosome may provide a new way to understand how the parasite evades immune responses.
The paper discusses the role of the Greatwall kinase/Mastl->PP2A/B5 pathway in regulating the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) during mitosis. The authors found that mice lacking the Mastl gene, which encodes the Greatwall kinase, have delayed entry into mitosis and premature silencing of the SAC. This premature silencing leads to cells entering mitosis with misaligned chromosomes, resulting in anaphase bridges and binucleated cells. The authors identified Cdk1 phosphorylation of MPS1 as one of the targets of the Greatwall kinase/Mastl->PP2A/B5 pathway that is required for full MPS1 kinase activity and SAC maintenance. They showed that Mastl activity is required for robust SAC maintenance until chromosomes are properly bi-stably attached, but not for establishment of the checkpoint itself. Inhibition of PP2A activity by OKA rescued MPS1 activity and kinetochore localization of MPS1 in Mastl knockout cells, suggesting that P2A activity dephosphorylates MPS1. The authors propose that this regulatory loop involving Mastl, PP2A/B5 and MPS1 helps maintain the SAC by restraining P2A activity until chromosomes are properly aligned.
The paper discusses how the development of the mandibulohyoid junction in the zebrafish head involves neural crest cells. The neural crest cells express a protein called Cyp26b1 which helps to promote the proper formation of tendons and muscles in the ventral midline of the pharyngeal arch. The study found that when Cyp26b1 function is disrupted, the mandibulohyoid junction does not form properly and muscles are mispatterned. The researchers identified a novel mutant allele of Cyp26b1 that causes similar muscle and tendon defects as previous described alleles. They found that neural crest cells expressing Cyp26b1 are required for the proper formation of the mandibulohyoid junction but tenoblasts are not sufficient for muscle patterning. The neural crest cells that express Cyp26b1 likely promote the formation of specific tendon condensations and muscle elongation. The study suggests that signals from these neural crest cells are critical for musculoskelet integration.
The paper uses econometric modeling to analyze the relationship between vaccinating dogs, reducing dog rabies cases, and reducing human deaths from rabies. The authors found that vaccinating dogs reduces the number of rabies cases in the following years, which in turn reduces the number of reported exposures and PEP completions. However, the number of reported exposures and PEP completions tends to increase as rabies cases and dog vaccination rates decline. This suggests that awareness and salience of rabies as a risk, rather than the actual rabies transmission rate, drive the increase in exposure reporting and PEP use. This highlights the importance of promoting integrated approaches that systematically assess and manage potential dog bites, including clinical assessment, quarantine, and laboratory testing, to reduce false-positive PEP prescriptions and false negatives leading to human death. The findings from Latin America illustrate how coordinated multi-national investments can reduce dog and human rabies over time, but also suggests that PEP demand may not necessarily decrease proportionally to rabies elimination. The paper emphasizes the need for ongoing evaluation of human exposure data and PEP use to support sustainable rabies elimination efforts, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.
The paper describes a new mouse model for studying ovarian cancer. Mice with the gene ERαd were generated by deleting the gene that codes for the estrogen receptor alpha in the pituitary but not in the ovary. This led to high levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) which stimulated the ovary to produce more estrogen. The ovaries of these mice developed tumors, which were found to be epithelial in origin and dependent on local estrogen production within the tumor. The tumors had genetic changes similar to human serous ovarian cancer, including overexpression of genes like PDGFRα, VCAM, and WIP1. The tumors were also inhibited by treatment with letrozole, which reduces estrogen production. This suggests that estrogen signaling within the tumor plays a key role in the development and progression of ovarian epithelial tumors. The model provides a unique opportunity to study the mechanisms by which estrogen signaling promotes ovarian tumorigenesis and may help identify potential therapeutic targets.
The paper investigates how the expression of a gene called Phlda2 in the offspring of a mother mouse influences the mother's maternal behavior. The researchers found that when the offspring's Phlda2 gene is silenced, the mother spends more time nursing and grooming her pups, indicating increased maternal care. This suggests that the offspring's gene expression can influence the mother's behavior even before it is born. This is a rare example of a gene modification in the offspring that leads to increased maternal care, consistent with the idea that males invest less in maternal care than females. The study shows that the mother's brain is programmed to respond to the placental hormones that are produced by the placenta during pregnancy, which in turn influences her behavior. The researchers propose that the placenta plays a key role in regulating the mother's care for her pups. The findings may have implications for human health, as elevated placental Phlda2 expression is associated with foetal growth restriction and mood disorders in pregnancy.
The paper describes how molecular dynamics simulations can be used to study the recognition of molecules within a protein. The researchers used molecular dynamics simulations to compute potentials of mean force (PMFs) between different parts of the protein colicin immunity protein Im9. They found that some nonnative configurations of Im9 were favored over native configurations, indicating a degree of frustration in the protein's packing. They showed that nonnative packing of helices H1 and H2 was favored over native packing in some cases, which was unexpected since experiments indicate little frustration in Im9 folding. However, the simulations revealed that the native fold was favored overall due to the presence of other parts of the protein like helix H4, which could guide the nonnative packing. The results suggest that favorable nonnative interactions can be suppressed during folding by folding trajectories that assemble H1 and H2 in the presence of H4 and flanking residues, helping avoid kinetic traps. The study provides a physical rationale for why Im9 folding pathways may have evolved to avoid certain frustration. The results demonstrate the potential of molecular dynamics simulations for deciphering the physical basis of molecular recognition within proteins.
This paper investigated how the microclimate (microclimate) experienced by mosquitoes in urban, suburban, and rural areas in Athens, Georgia affects their life history traits and transmission potential for dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses. The researchers found that mosquitoes in urban areas experienced warmer temperatures and lower humidity than suburban and rural areas, which may impact their survival, development, and emergence. In the summer, higher temperatures during the day reduced the likelihood of mosquito emergence, while cooler temperatures at night increased it. In the fall, the opposite was found, with higher temperatures during the day increasing emergence. This resulted in mosquitoes in urban areas having lower survival rates, smaller sizes, and lower population growth rates compared to suburban and rural areas. The study also found that transmission potential varied across seasons and land uses, with urban areas having higher transmission potential in the summer and lower transmission potential in the fall. The findings suggest that subtle differences in microclimate can have significant effects on mosquito traits and transmission potential, which may be important for predicting transmission risk and disease risk. However, the study notes that other factors like habitat quality and human behavior also play a role in transmission, and that more research is needed to fully understand the relationship between microclimate and transmission.
The paper discusses the structure of the herpesvirus Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) capsid protein, which is essential for HCMV infection. The capsid protein is composed of four proteins called major capsid protein (MCP), minor capsid protein (mCP), the smallest capsid protein (SCP), and the mCP-binding protein (mC-P). The SCP protein is small and unique to HCMV, but its function is unknown. The capsid protein is the largest among all herpesviruses and encodes many conserved proteins. The authors used ribozymes to specifically target the SCP protein in infected cells to determine its function. They found that SCP is required for the HCMV capsid protein to bind to the tegument protein pp150, which is essential for HCMV infection. The absence of SCP resulted in non-infectious viral particles that lacked the genome. The study shows that SCP plays a unique role in stabilizing the DNA-filled capsid, and provides a potential target for intervention against HCMV infection. The small size and essential function of SCP make it a promising candidate for designing peptide inhibitors that could prevent HCMV infection.
The paper discusses how a single fertilized egg develops into a mammalian embryo using a computational model. The model combines cellular mechanics and gene expression to explain how cells differentiate into different tissue types. The authors simulate how cell division, gene expression and mechanical interactions between cells influence the formation of the embryo. They show how the embryo's orientation in two dimensions can be influenced by the shape of the pellucid zone and how this in turn affects the orientation of the two-cell embryo and blastocyst. They also examine how the formation of the trophectoderm and endoderm layers is influenced by cell division patterns and gene expression. They find that mechanical constraints, such as cell position within the embryo, play a key role in determining the orientation of the embryo. They also model how the endoderm layer is formed through cell adhesion and motility. The authors hope their approach will help us better understand how cells differentiate into different tissue types and how this process can be influenced by different mechanisms.
This paper analyzed the genomic and spatial-temporal dynamics of influenza A virus during a single US epidemic season in 2006-207. The researchers collected and sequenced 353 whole-genome influenza virus samples from 175 A/H1N1 and 69 A/H3N2 isolates across 30 states and found multiple genetic clades (8 for A/H1N1 and 6 for A/H3N2) circulated during the epidemic. These clades co-circulated in both space and time, with no strong signal for viral migration between them. The A/H1N1 clade was dominant during the season, but a switch to the A/H3N2 subtype occurred later. The researchers identified 5 antigenically distinct types of influenza A virus and found multiple reassortment events within the A/H3N2 viruses, including a clade that reacquired sensitivity to adamantane through genomic reassortment. The findings suggest that multiple introductions of virus occurred during the season, rather than a single lineage spreading across the US. The study highlights the complexity of influenza virus evolution and the importance of global sequencing efforts to understand the global context of the diversity that enters the US during an epidemic.
This paper describes the discovery of a new protein called DYF-1 (DYF1MIP-T3) that is involved in the formation and function of cilia in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. The authors found that DYF-1 is expressed specifically in ciliated cells and associates with the ciliary axonemes and basal bodies. They showed that DYF-1 is required for the proper formation and function of cilia, as mutants lacking the gene have ciliary defects. They also showed that DYF-1 is an intraflagellar transport protein that is necessary for the formation of full-length, functional cilia. The authors propose that DYF-1 may help maintain the integrity of the intraflagellar transport machinery and assemble kines into the IFT complex. The paper suggests that DYF-1 plays a conserved role in cilia formation across species, as orthologs of the protein are found in organisms with and without flagella. The findings provide evidence that DYF-1 plays a critical role in modulating Wnt signaling pathways, which are important for proper cilia function.
The paper describes the generation of two mouse models that mimic the genetic and epigenetic features of a genetic disorder called facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD). The disorder is caused by a contraction of a repeat of DNA called the D4Z4 macrosatellite, which contains the gene DUX4. The DUX4 gene encodes a transcription factor that is normally expressed in the germline cells but is aberrantly expressed in muscle cells in FSHD patients. The two mouse models, D4Z4-2.5 and D4Z4-1.5, were generated by integrating human D4Z4 genes into mouse chromosomes with different numbers of repeat units. The D4Z4-2.5 mice show a variegated pattern of DUX4 expression in muscle cells, consistent with FSHD patients, while the D4Z4-1.5 mice show more efficient repression of DUX4 expression. The mouse models provide a useful tool to study the in vivo regulation of DUX4 and its effects on muscle cells, which may help develop therapies for FSHD.
The paper describes a new undergraduate research experience program called Rosetta Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) that allows students to conduct research in a distributed computational biology environment. The program aims to expose students to virtual research communities and facilitate collaboration between students from different institutions. The REU program is designed to expose students to a virtual research environment and hands-on lab experiences to encourage creativity and problem-solving frameworks. The program recruits students from diverse backgrounds, especially underrepresented groups, and aims to attract and retain underrepresented groups in computational science, chemistry and engineering. To achieve this, the program recruits students through targeted outreach to organizations, affinity groups, and conferences. The program includes a one week boot camp to teach software development skills and Rosetta concepts to new students and aims to foster strong bonds between students through collaboration tools. Students conduct research projects at different Rosetta labs over 8 weeks, present their work at the Rosetta conference and share their results. The program has attracted diverse students, including 63% women, 13% African Americans, and 13% Hispanics, and 12 out of 12 alumni are now pursuing PhDs or careers in science. The program shows that undergraduates can perform research in a distributed environment and that a virtual REU model can attract a diverse cohort. The program aims to improve mentoring and community building to help students get the most out of the experience.
The paper describes how a protein called hBD3 enhances the immune response to polyI:C, a molecule that stimulates immune cells through the MDA5 receptor. hBD3 is a member of the β-defensin family of antimicrobial peptides and is expressed on the surface of immune cells. The study found that hBD3 enhances the production of cytokines TNF-α, IL-6 and Interferon-β in response to polyI:C, but inhibits the production of CXCL10. The mechanism involves hBD3 altering the localization of polyI:C within immune cells, allowing it to more easily interact with the MDA5 receptor. This enhances the MDA5-mediated pathway and produces more Interferon-β. The study found that hBD3 expression increases during viral infection and may provide some protection against viral infection, but high levels of hBD3 have been linked to psoriasis, which suggests that the double-edged sword effect of increased hBD3 expression may contribute to psoriasis. The study showed that hBD3 expression in mice and humans enhances the response to polyI:C in macrophages, but the effect is not specific to the synthetic hBD3 peptide used.
The paper investigates the role of glucose metabolism in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacteria that causes tuberculosis, during chronic infection in mice. The researchers found that M. tuberculosis has two enzymes called glucokinases that can phosphorylate glucose to produce glucose-6-phosphate. However, they found that the primary glucokinase, called polyphosphate glucokinase (PPG), is required for M. tuberculosis to grow on glucose as the sole carbon source in vitro. The second glucokinase, called glucokinase A (GLKA), is less efficient and is not sufficient to support growth in the absence of PPG. The researchers found that M. tuberculosis lacking both glucokinases was unable to persist in mice, indicating that glucose phosphorylation is important for M. tuberculosis survival during chronic infection. They also found that loss of glucokinase activity made M. tuberculosis more susceptible to hydrogen peroxide stress, suggesting that glucose phosphorylation provides a metabolic advantage. The study highlights the importance of glucose metabolism for M. tuberculosis's pathogenesis and flexibility to adapt to different environments. The results suggest that M. tuberculosis can utilize glucose as an alternative carbon source when lipids are not available.
The paper investigates how avian influenza viruses, which have been linked to the spread of human and livestock influenza, migrate between different bird populations. Using a 25 year dataset of over 30,000 bird samples collected from 20 locations across North America, the authors analyzed the genetic diversity and migration patterns of the viruses to determine how they spread between different bird populations. They found that while the viruses tend to stay within flyways for short periods of time, they can also rapidly migrate between flyways over long distances, potentially facilitating the survival and persistence of introduced viruses. The authors identified 16 discrete geographic regions where the viruses were sampled and analyzed the reassortment patterns within and between these regions. They found that while there was little evidence of geographic structuring of the virus population over long periods, an exception was a single lineage that had circulated for over 10 years in birds sampled from Delaware Bay. This suggests that while the population of viruses may be localized, the movement of viruses between bird populations is extensive and rapid, likely facilitated by congregation sites where multiple flyways overlap. The results suggest that while the migration of viruses between bird populations may be restricted within a flyway over short periods, longer-term diffusion of viral lineages between host populations is more common. The findings provide important insights into how avian influenza viruses spread and persist in wild bird populations and inform preparedness plans to respond to emerging viral threats.
The paper describes a new method called HLA*IMP:02 that can accurately impute genetic information about the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) types from genotype data from multiple populations. The method is designed to handle two main challenges: haplotypic heterogeneity and genotyping errors. The authors show that their method, HLA*IMP:02, performs better than the previous method, HLA*IMP:01, when applied to heterogeneous reference panels with samples from multiple populations. This is because HLA*IMP:02 can accommodate the fact that HLA alleles can appear on different haplotypes in different populations. The authors demonstrate that HLA*IMP:02 can impute HLA alleles with high accuracy even when applied to samples from different ethnicities, while maintaining good performance for European samples. They also show that adding more diverse reference data from other populations can further improve the accuracy of HLA*IMP:02 for non-European samples. The authors hope that their method will help enable genome-wide association studies to better understand the genetic risks of complex diseases that involve HLA types.
The paper describes the role of a special type of immune cell called ChAT+ T-cells in protecting the host from enteric bacterial infections. These cells are found in the colon and can release acetylcholine (ACh) which helps regulate immune responses and mucosal defense. The authors found that when they conditionally ablated these cells, they had increased bacterial burden in the colon, indicating that the ACh released from the ChAT+ T-cells played a protective role. The authors suggest that the activation of these cells by the sympathetic nervous system may be involved in this protection, possibly through the release of norepinephrine (NE) from neurons. This study highlights the integration between the nervous and immune systems and the importance of specialized T-cells that release ACh in modulating immune function. The findings suggest that ChAT+ T-cells play a critical role in limiting the number and harmful effects of enteric bacteria in the gut, and further research is needed to fully understand how they work.
The paper describes a novel technique called frequency response analysis to study how protein dynamics propagate information through the protein. The method involves applying periodic perturbations to specific parts of the protein, like the WPD loop, and analyzing the fluctuations of atomic variables in response to the perturbations. The technique was used on the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B. The results show that the perturbations propagate information through the protein by affecting certain atoms in phase with each other, which indicates the atoms are coupled through fluctuations. The technique identified clusters of atoms that are coupled in phase with each other, which suggests the perturbations are transmitted through different parts of the protein. The technique was able to identify specific residues that are important for signal propagation through the protein. The study shows that perturbation frequency affects the transmission of information and the technique can be used to analyze the time-dependent dynamics of proteins. Overall, the frequency response analysis technique provides a convenient way to study how information is transmitted through proteins.
The paper proposes a novel method called Sequence-based Feature Projection Ensemble Learning (SFPEL-LPI) to predict interactions between non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and proteins. The method uses sequence-derived features and similarities to make predictions. It combines multiple features to extract features from lncRNA and protein sequences, known lncRNA-protein interactions, and interactions profiles. The method can predict interactions for both known and unknown lncRAs and proteins. The authors show that SFPEL-LPI outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a benchmark dataset, especially for predicting interactions for new lncRAs and proteins. However, the method has limitations such as needing parameter tuning and limited interactions. The authors construct a web server to facilitate the predictions and provide functional annotations of predicted proteins. The paper demonstrates the ability of SFPEL-LPI to find novel lncRNA-protein interactions.
This paper investigated the spatial distribution of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes at the household level in two neighborhoods in Iquitos, Peru with different levels of infestation. The study found that while adult mosquitoes showed focal distribution, the clusters of high abundance were temporary and did not persist across multiple surveys. This suggests that targeting individual households identified as hotspots may not be an effective strategy for controlling dengue transmission. Instead, targeting larger areas with historically high transmission levels within a city may be more effective. The paper argues that entomological measures should account for the spatial and temporal variability of mosquito distribution at the household level, rather than relying on a fixed 100 meter threshold for control measures. This is because infected people can move the virus beyond 100 meters of their home, and mosquitoes tend to not fly far from their breeding sites. The findings suggest that more targeted and efficient vector control measures should focus on larger areas rather than individual households to reduce the risk of transmission.
The paper describes a new approach to understanding how the neural network of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans operates. The authors use a dynamics-based perspective to analyze the directed connectome, rather than focusing on structural properties. They use flow-based community detection and flow-based role identification to identify groups of neurons that play similar roles in propagating information through the network. They show that the network exhibits a hierarchical organization at different scales, with some neurons playing key roles in specific functions. They also demonstrate how ablating individual or pairs of neurons affects the flow structure, providing insights into which neurons might be important for specific behaviors. The approach can be used to guide experimental investigations and provide hypotheses about which neurons to study. The approach could be used in combination with high-throughput ablation and monitoring techniques to measure signal propagation in the network, which could help link network structure to function.
The paper describes a deep learning model called MRNet that can accurately classify knee MRI scans into abnormal or normal. The model was trained on a dataset of knee MRI scans from Stanford University Medical Center and achieved an AUC of 0.84 on an external dataset. The model was able to detect ACL tears with high specificity and accuracy, and meniscal tears with good sensitivity and accuracy. Providing the model's predictions to clinicians as a diagnostic aid resulted in higher specificity in detecting ACL tears. The authors conclude that deep learning models have the potential to assist radiologists and non-radiologist clinicians in interpreting knee MRI scans, potentially reducing unnecessary testing and surgery. However, more work is needed to determine optimal model performance and integration in the clinical setting. The model was found to achieve better performance after training on external datasets and providing model predictions to clinicians increased specificity in detecting ACL tears. The authors suggest that deep learning models could potentially optimize the interpretation of knee MRI scans and improve diagnostic accuracy.
The paper describes how researchers determined the atomic structure of the carbohydrate binding site on the surface of the norovirus protein VA207, which is a member of the GII.9 genotype. They used X-ray crystallography to determine the structure of VA207 and then performed mutation studies to identify the key residues involved in binding to different types of human blood group antigens. They found that VA207 binds to Lewis antigens through an α-1,3 fucose epitope on the surface of the protein, while VA38 binds to secretor antigens through an α-1,2 fucose epitope. They also found that introducing mutations to key residues involved in the carbohydrate binding pocket resulted in loss of binding to all blood group antigens, indicating that this pocket is essential for the virus' ability to recognize and bind to them. They hypothesize that the addition of sialic acid to the protein may stabilize the structure of the sialylated antigens and improve binding to VA207. They conclude that understanding the structure of the carbohydrate binding site is important for understanding how diverse noroviruses recognize and bind to different types of human blood group antigens, and that the human blood group antigens play a critical role in norovirus evolution.
This paper describes a method to map recombination rates in poliovirus using synthetic genomes. The authors created a synthetic poliovirus genome with 36 specific markers spaced every 18nt across the genome, then coinfected cells with the synthetic and wild type virus to produce a population of viral progeny. They used Illumina sequencing to detect recombinants between the synthetic and wild type genomes. They found that certain features of the genome, such as RNA secondary structure and GC content, influenced the frequency of recombination. They used the synthetic genome to identify specific genome regions that could be modified to increase recombination rates. They modified one such region by increasing GC content and found that this increased recombination by 7.4x over that region. They conclude that modifying the genome to reduce recombination could be a useful strategy to attenuate recombination in vaccine strains.
The paper discusses the ability of microbial pathogens like Borrelia burgdorferi to evolve and adapt to their hosts through evolvability, which is the ability to rapidly produce new antigens to evade the immune system. The authors analyze the genetic diversity of the unexpressed cassettes in the vlsE locus of B. burgdorferi, which are used for antigenic variation, and find that natural selection favors lineages with greater genetic diversity among these cassettes, leading to increased antigenic evolvability. They show that non-synonymous substitutions in the antigenic loop regions of the cassettes are more common than synonymous substitutions, indicating that natural selection favors mutations that change amino acid composition. They also find that tandem repeat structures, which are prone to length mutations, are highly conserved among the cassettes and result in length variation that can alter antigenic epitopes. This suggests that natural selection maintains the genetic diversity among the unexpressed cassettes to promote antigenic evolvability, allowing the pathogen to rapidly adapt to the immune response. The results support a model where selection favors genetic diversity among the cassettes to increase the pathogen's ability to produce novel antigens and persist within hosts. The authors propose that this could be a common strategy for maintaining antigenic evolvability in diverse pathogens, and may help explain why some pathogens exhibit sophisticated antigenic variation.
This paper investigates the role of a protein called TREM-2 in the immune response during pneumococococcal pneumonia. TREM-2 is found on immune cells in the lungs, particularly macrophages and dendritic cells, and is known to suppress the expression of inflammatory genes. The authors found that TREM-2 on macrophages in the lungs specifically suppresses the production of a protein called C1q, which helps macrophages phagocytose bacteria. This reduces inflammation in the lungs, which is important for protecting against pneumococcal infections. In mice lacking TREM-2, macrophages have higher levels of C1q and exhibit enhanced phagocytosis of bacteria, leading to increased inflammation and poorer survival during pneumonia. The authors conclude that targeting TREM-2 may be a novel strategy to modulate C1q production and pulmonary immune responses, which could be relevant for other respiratory infections and autoimmune diseases.
This paper investigated the generation and role of Th17 cells during Schistosoma japonicum infection in mice. Th17 cells are a type of T cell that helps the immune system fight extracellular parasites like Schistosoma. The study found that during Schistosoma infection, Th17 cells increased slowly in the first 5 weeks, then rapidly after 5 weeks. This increase was accompanied by the development of granulomas in the liver, which are immune responses against the parasite. However, Th1, Th2 and Treg cells, which can suppress Th17 cell differentiation, also increased at the same time. This suggests that the parasite antigens induced more of the Th17 cell inducing factors than the Th17 cell suppressing factors. The study also showed that immunization with Schistosoma eggs (SEA) preferentially induced Th17 cells and increased the production of factors that help Th17 cell differentiation. High levels of IL-17 were associated with severe liver pathogenesis, but the authors found that reducing IL-17 levels actually contributed to protective responses against Schistosoma infection. This suggests that IL-17 levels during the early stage of infection may play a role in protecting against Schistosoma infection.
The paper describes the discovery of a new gene called SREB that regulates the phase transition between yeast and mold forms in the dimorphic fungus Blastomyces dermatidis. The researchers used a technique called Agrobacterium-mediated DNA transfer to introduce random DNA into Blastomyces dermatidis conidia, then screened for colonies that had altered morphology. They identified one colony with a yellow-orange pigmentation and analyzed it further to find that it had a mutation in the gene SREB, which encodes a GATA transcription factor that regulates the biosynthesis of siderophores. The mutant was unable to convert from yeast to mold form when grown at 2°C, and produced siderophores even when iron was abundant, indicating that SREB functions as a repressor of siderophore biosynthesis. The researchers also found that SREB regulates genes involved in lipid metabolism and transport, which may contribute to its ability to promote the phase transition. The discovery of SREB provides a new understanding of how dimorphic fungi regulate their growth and survival in different environments.
The paper discusses how the protein Sae2 is regulated in order to promote DNA repair in response to DNA damage. Sae2 is involved in a process called end resection, where it removes parts of broken DNA strands. The researchers found that Sae2 is modified by two different ways: phosphorylation and sumoylation. They found that both modifications together have an additive effect on Sae2 function. Sumoylation of Sae2 promotes its ability to remove parts of broken DNA strands, while phosphorylation of Sae2 increases its solubility. They showed that reducing sumoylation of Sae2 reduces its ability to perform end resection, while reducing MRX sumoylation also reduces end resection. They propose that sumoylation and phosphorylation act in an "ensemble effect" to promote Sae2 function. This suggests that multiple protein modifications can work together to regulate Sae2's activity to ensure that it is available when needed. The researchers hope that their findings will help identify other ways that proteins are regulated in this manner to promote DNA repair.
This paper discusses a new model of understanding urinary tract infections (UTIs) that may help explain why some people develop chronic infections and others do not. The authors found that mice with a genetic background that predisposes them to increased mucosal TLR4 signaling (Toll-like receptor 4) are more likely to develop chronic cystitis (bladder inflammation) after an initial UTI. They showed that this chronic inflammation leads to a higher susceptibility to developing chronic infections again after antibiotic treatment has cleared the initial infection. They found that the degree of acute bladder inflammation at 24 hours after infection is a good predictor of the likelihood of developing chronic cystitis, and that elevated levels of serum cytokines such as IL-5, IL-6, G-CSF, and KC at 24 hours also predict chronic cystitis. They showed that the development of chronic cystitis requires a severe acute immune response and that lymphocytes likely play a role. They also found that a single dose of dexamethasone treatment shortly before infection can enhance the development of chronic cystitis. They propose that initial episodes of UTI in susceptible individuals may be particularly severe and prolonged, allowing chronic bacterial persistence in the bladder that then increases susceptibility to recurrent infections. This model could help explain why some people develop chronic UTIs while others do not.
The paper describes a mathematical model to study how two neural networks can synchronize their oscillations and communicate through phase-locking, which is observed in the brain. The authors propose a framework to explain how phase-locking between two neural networks emerges and how the phase lag between them can be used to infer the direction of information transfer between the networks. They use a model of excitatory and inhibitory neurons connected through synapses, and show that the phase lag between the networks can be controlled by the strength of the synaptic connections and the delay between the networks. They show that when the networks are in a "symmetry-broken" state, where one network leads the other, the phase lag between them depends on where the signal originates and propagates, and can be used to infer the direction of information transfer. They demonstrate this by computing the phase resetting curves of the networks and comparing the phase shifts of the two networks caused by perturbations to either the leading or following network. The results show that depending on where the signal originates and propagates, the phase shifts of the two networks are different, indicating that information can flow in a directed manner from the leading network to the following network. This provides evidence that the phase-locking between the networks is due to the system dynamics rather than just the symmetrical connectivity between them. The findings could help explain how the brain's gamma oscillations are involved in information transfer between different brain regions.
This paper analyzed the genetic diversity of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum in a single population in The Gambia to identify potential targets of immune selection. The researchers sequenced 65 clinical isolates and identified genes with high levels of polymorphism consistent with balancing selection, which is a mechanism that occurs when the immune system puts pressure on the parasite to maintain diversity. They found that genes encoding proteins on the surface of the parasite's merozoite stage were particularly likely to show balancing selection, and that a gene called PF1035, which encodes a protein with a histone methylation mark associated with silencing of sub-telomeric genes, had the highest Tajima's D value. They showed that this gene was expressed in only a minority of mature schizonts within any parasite clone, but the proportion of positive schizonts varied significantly among clones and over time for a single clone. This suggests that the protein may play a role in balancing polymorphism and repressing expression. The researchers propose that immune selection is the primary cause of selection on asexual haploid blood stage parasites, but other mechanisms may also operate. Identifying and studying the targets of balancing selection could lead to new vaccine candidates.
This paper examines the evolution of protein domains in 40 free-living organisms using a phylogenomic approach. The authors find that overwhelmingly more protein domains are gained than lost across all superkingdoms of life, with gains increasing linearly with evolutionary time. This suggests that the ability to generate new protein domains is a continuous process. The gain-to-loss ratio increases from 1.3 in the early evolutionary period to 1.9 in the late period. The gain-to-loss ratio is higher in the archaeal superkingdom, indicating that genome reduction may have played a role in the origin of Archaea. The bacterial superkingdom gains more domains than loses, while the eukaryal superkingdom loses more domains than gains. The gain-to-loss ratio in Eukarya decreases with time, indicating that the emergence of novel domains through gene duplication and rearrangement may have occurred. The paper finds that the ability to generate new domains is an ongoing process and provides insights into the evolutionary history of different superkingdoms.
The paper discusses the importance of providing hygiene-based interventions to manage lymphedema, a common disabling condition caused by lymphatic filariasis, in areas where the parasitic infection is endemic. The authors found through a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that hygiene-based interventions significantly reduce the frequency of acute bacterial dermatolymphangitis episodes, which are a major source of suffering for lymphedema patients. This reduction in acute episodes leads to improved quality of life, lower levels of disability, and increased ability to work. The authors argue that providing hygiene-based interventions to manage lymphedema is critical to achieve the World Health Organization's goal of eliminating lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem, as it can significantly reduce the morbidity and suffering associated with the condition. While mass distribution of antifilarial drugs can interrupt transmission, providing hygiene-based interventions can increase acceptance of treatment and improve coverage. Integrated hygiene-based interventions that include water, sanitation, and emollients to maintain skin hydration and barrier function are recommended, but are not widely implemented. The paper suggests that scaling up hygiene-based interventions could benefit millions of people affected by lymphedema worldwide.
This paper describes a study that measured the number of genetically distinct malaria parasite clones that children acquired over time in Papua New Guinea. The researchers found that children aged 0.9 to 4.5 years acquired twice as many genetically distinct Plasmodium vivax clones as children aged 5-4 years, indicating that younger children are more exposed to malaria and acquire more immunity. They found that the number of clones acquired did not change significantly with age, while the incidence of clinical malaria episodes decreased with age, suggesting that exposure to high levels of malaria in early childhood contributes to rapid immunity. This suggests that high exposure to malaria, especially in the first few years of life, may be sufficient for children to acquire some immunity against clinical malaria. The study concludes that the number of genetically distinct parasite clones acquired over time is a significant contributor to the rapid acquisition of immunity against clinical Plasmodium vivax malaria, although it is less closely linked to transmission intensity than for Plasmodium falciparum.
The paper discusses the association between vitamin D deficiency (VDD) and the risk of developing tuberculosis (TB). While some studies have shown lower vitamin D levels among TB patients compared to healthy controls, it is unclear if VDD actually causes TB disease or if TB disease leads to decreased serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels. This paper aimed to answer this question by analyzing a large prospective cohort of household contacts of TB patients in Peru and pooling data from other studies to conduct an individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis. The results suggest that low 25(OH)D levels are associated with an increased risk of TB disease, particularly among HIV positive individuals with severe vitamin D deficiency. However, the study found that adjusting for vitamin A levels modestly attenuated the impact of vitamin D on TB risk. The findings suggest that vitamin D status may be related to other micronutrients implicated in the pathogenesis of TB, and that the effect of low 25(OH)D on TB risk may be more pronounced among HIV positive patients. The study had some limitations, including a short follow-up period and lack of data on VDR genotypes, but the results provide evidence that vitamin D may play a role in TB infection and disease. The authors argue that randomized controlled trials are needed to determine whether vitamin D supplementation can mitigate the risk of developing TB disease in individuals at high risk.
The paper discusses how different types of sensors in living cells can detect chemical changes in their environment and how their ability to sense these changes is influenced by various characteristics. The authors use a simple mathematical model called the Monod-Wyman-Changeux model to analyze the performance of different sensors, including allosteric transcription factors. They find that different characteristics of sensors are related and specifying one characteristic strongly influences others. For example, sensors with more subunits have higher dynamic range, capacity and lower intrinsic noise, but a slower response time. The paper shows that most of the possible parameter space for these sensors is inaccessible, meaning that sensors must trade off one characteristic for another. The paper concludes that natural selection likely acts to balance the values of these characteristics to maximize overall performance of the sensing system.
The paper investigates the variability in the progression of Alzheimer's disease across patients. It analyzes a large dataset of patients to determine how long each stage of cognitive and functional decline lasts, as measured by the Global Deterioration Scale and Functional Assessment Scale. The study finds that there is significant variability in the durations of stages 4-6 of AD, with standard deviations being as large as the mean values. This suggests that the disease progresses at different rates for different patients. The paper concludes that the high variability is consistent with previous studies showing that AD is a heterogeneous disease. It also finds that no demographic factors such as age, sex or education are significantly correlated with the rate of progression. The study highlights the importance of analyzing longitudinal data to determine the distribution of disease stages accurately, as the data is limited and biased in the current dataset. The authors propose methods to estimate the mean and standard deviations of stage durations, which they use to show that the variability in stages is significant. The findings suggest that there are different rates of progression for different patients, which may be due to a combination of factors such as biomarkers, genetics, and lifestyle.
The paper describes a study that used imaging and graph theory to investigate how long-term memories are organized in the brain. The study used mice trained to associate a context with an a mild shock. The mice were tested for freezing behavior at short and long delays after training to see how memory expression of the memory changes. The researchers found that at short and long delays, functional networks engaged by memory recall were distinct and had different properties. The functional networks had a small-world topology, with highly connected hubs that likely play key roles in network function. At the long delay, the network had a thalamic-hippocortical-cortical signature. At the short delay, functional connections within the neocortex were distinct from the long-term network. The researchers identified key brain regions that likely play important roles in memory expression and resilience, including the anterior cingulate cortex and prelimbic cortex. The study suggests that memory consolidation involves strengthening of inter-cortical connections and emergence of prefrontal cortical roles. The degeneracy of memory networks means that not all manipulations of key brain regions necessarily prevent memory formation, although some degenerate solutions may be less robust. The findings provide insights into how long-term memories are organized in the brain.
The paper discusses how the nucleosome remodeler protein dMi-2 is recruited to activated heat shock genes in Drosophila. The authors found that dMi-2 binds to the PAR polymer that accumulates rapidly upon heat shock, and not to the nucleosomes. They propose that dMi-2 is initially recruited via interaction with the PAR polymer and then switches to interacting with the emerging transcripts. This two-step process allows dMi-2 to be rapidly recruited to the activated genes. The authors suggest that PARylation of the genes acts as a signal to recruit chromatin remodeling factors like dMi-2. The study shows that dMi-2 binds to both DNA and RNA and that RNA can compete with DNA for binding, indicating that dMi-2 binds the nascent transcripts. The study argues that the PAR polymer acts as a scaffold to redirect dMi-2 to the chromatin regions where high levels of activity are required. The rapid recruitment of dMi-2 to activated genes through PARylation likely plays an important role in efficiently responding to environmental stresses like heat shock and DNA damage.
This paper discusses a method to estimate the accuracy of diagnostic tests for canine echinoccosis (Echinocococcus infections in dogs) in the absence of a perfect gold standard. The authors used latent-class analysis to model the true prevalence and diagnostic test performance of three tests: copro-antigen ELISA, two species-specific copro-PCRs, and arecoline purgation. They found that the sensitivity of the arecoline purgation test was estimated to be higher than previously reported, around 75%, but that the specificity of the PCR test was lower, around 660-70%. They also found that the sensitivity of the copro-antigen ELISA test increased with higher parasite abundance, while the specificity of the PCR test remained relatively constant. The authors also found that dog sex and Taenia co-infection were not significant covariates, while age and Taenia co-infection were significant. The results demonstrate the importance of modeling the true prevalence of in diagnostic tests rather than just the test prevalence, and using multiple tests to estimate accuracy.
This paper presents a new method to study the mechanism of DNA synthesis in cells. The researchers used a technique called DNA fiber spreading to label DNA foci within individual chromosomes in individual nuclei and cells. They analyzed the spatial organization of these foci over time and found that foci labeled at different times of DNA synthesis still maintain a spatial relationship within individual chromosomes. This suggests that the sequential activation of DNA foci defines the timing of DNA synthesis. They also found that the genetic continuity of DNA foci within chromosomes is the major mechanism that defines the replication program in mammalian cells. The researchers analyzed data from individual cells and cell populations and found that replication domains containing 50 kb of DNA provide the functional targets during DNA synthesis. This genetic continuity of foci along chromosomes minimizes the number of exposed forks and allows DNA synthesis to proceed efficiently while preserving genetic and epigenetic information. The method used to study DNA synthesis within individual nuclei provides detail related to specific events within cells, while population-based studies have shown that large regions of the genome replicate during predictable intervals of DNA synthesis. The researchers propose that the sequential activation of DNA foci based on their genetic continuity along chromosomes has evolved as a mechanism to ensure efficient DNA synthesis while preserving genetic information.
The paper discusses how different mutant mice were created to test the effect of the drug Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on various behaviors. They found that different mutant mice lacking the cannabinoid receptor CB1 in different neuron populations had different effects on the behaviors. The mice lacking CB1 expression in GABAergic neurons did not show the expected effects of THC, indicating that GABAergic neurons do not mediate the effects. However, cortical glutamatergic neurons did mediate some of the effects, particularly the hypolocomotion and hypothermia effects. The analgesic effects did not depend on GABAergic neurons, but rather on principal neurons in the central nervous system. The cataptic effects did not depend on any one specific neuron population but rather a combination of cortical glutatergic neurons and striatal neurons. The results suggest that different neuron populations mediate different effects of THC and that conditional mutagenesis can be used to identify these effects. The paper provides insights into how different cannabinoid drugs may target different neuron populations to produce specific effects, potentially leading to more targeted therapies.
The paper discusses the potential for "interfering particles" to be used as a novel antiviral therapy to control the rapidly evolving HIV virus. The authors built a mathematical model to study how well these interfering particles, called "therapeutic interfering particles" or TIPs, would perform in controlling HIV infections. They found that TIPs could be engineered to express 3-5 times more genomic RNA than HIV to maintain stability within individual patients. However, they also found that HIV mutants that could resist TIPs by reducing their intracellular η parameter would still be able to spread and undermine the effectiveness of the TIP therapy at the population scale. This is because HIV mutants with lower η values could still generate higher HIV loads and prevalence within patients, even though they were less stable within individual hosts. The authors argued that TIPs could be engineered to be "resistance-proof" by requiring high levels of TIP expression, above 3, to maintain stability at both the individual and population scales. They also found that HIV mutants that could spread through populations would require both intra-scale and inter-scale conflicts, driven by the tradeoffs between within hosts and between hosts. They concluded that TIPs could be a promising approach for controlling HIV, but that the design constraints for "resistance-proof" TIPs need to be carefully considered to prevent the spread of HIV mutants that evade the therapy.
This paper investigates how the host gene TFRC (transferrin receptor) has evolved in response to the emergence of a new viral pandemic in dogs. The TFRC gene encodes a receptor that parviruses use to infect cells. The authors find that the gene has evolved under positive selection in the caniform (dog-like) lineage, particularly in species closely related to modern dogs. They introduce specific mutations in the TFRC gene of the black-backed jackal, a species that diverged before dogs, to test whether these mutations could have provided an adaptive advantage against parviruses. They find that these mutations reduce parvovirus binding and infection in TRVb cells, consistent with the idea that ancient parviruses may have driven the evolution of the TFRC gene. The study suggests that post-translational modifications like glycans may provide physical distance between the pathogen and receptor, allowing new glycosylation sites to be adaptively gained during host-pathogen arms races. The emergence of the canine parvovirus in dogs may have been a re-adaptation of a virus that previously infected their ancestors, rather than a novel virus emergence. The study provides insights into how viruses and hosts interact and evolve over long periods of time.
The paper describes a study on how genome random-encoding can be used to attenuate a highly virulent strain of the tick-borne flavivirus TBEV. The researchers randomly introduced 27 synonymous mutations into the NS5 gene of the Oshima 5-10 strain, which is known to cause neurovirulence, to produce a re-encoded virus with reduced pathogenicity. They found that the re-encoded virus had lower replicative fitness in cell culture compared to the original virus, but was still able to reproduce efficiently in mice. In vivo experiments showed that the re-encoded virus had reduced neuroinvasion and neurovirulence compared to the original virus, suggesting that the re-encoding process had decreased the virulence. They also showed that immunization with the re-encoded virus induced neutralizing antibodies and protected mice against subsequent challenge with the original virus. These results suggest that genome random-encoding could be a useful approach to produce a live attenuated vaccine that is safe and effective.
The paper discusses how two different serological tests, LID-1 and LID-NDO, can be used to detect Mycobacterium leprae infection in people, even before they show any symptoms. The tests were found to be more sensitive than bacilloscopy and could detect leprosy in people who were at high risk of developing the disease, especially household contacts of infected individuals. The tests were able to estimate the bacterial load of patients and could be used to monitor individuals at high risk of developing leprosy to identify new cases early. The study suggests that household contacts of Mycobacterium leprae infected individuals are at a higher risk of developing the disease and the tests could be used to increase vigilance to diagnose leprosy cases. The paper concludes that serological tests like LID-1 and LID-NDO could contribute to disease control in leprosy endemic regions, especially in areas where histopathological examinations are not available, by detecting asymptomatic infections and helping to identify new cases.
The paper describes how yeast cells are used to study the formation of prions, which are infectious proteins that cause neurodegenerative diseases. Prions are self-propagating proteins that convert into fibrous aggregates called amyloid, which are associated with various human diseases. The paper shows how yeast cells can be engineered to form prions and how prion formation can be influenced by factors like the presence of other proteins. The researchers used yeast cells with fluorescent proteins to visualize the formation of prion aggregates and found that the initial formation of prion aggregates occurs at specific sites in the cell where protein misfolding occurs, not randomly throughout the cell. The prions then nucleate and polymerize to form larger aggregates. The study shows that different types of proteins, like Rnq1 and Pin4C, interact with the initial prion aggregates in different ways, with Rnq1 forming mesh-like aggregates and Pin4C forming ring-like aggregates. The study also suggests that two mechanisms are involved in prion formation: cross-seeding, where the prion aggregates interact with heterologous amyloid proteins, and another mechanism that involves chaperones. The study provides insights into how prion formation and conversion to amyloid can occur in human diseases and may help researchers understand mechanisms underlying many neurodegenerative diseases.
This paper studies the role of the X chromosome in male and female meiosis in interspecific hybrids between two subspecies of mice. The authors find that the X chromosome plays a disproportionate role in causing hybrid sterility in these hybrids, particularly in male meiosis. They identify two hybrid sterility genes, Hstx1 and Hstx2, which are located on chromosome X and control the asymmetry of hybrid sterility in male meiosis. The authors show that heterosubspecific chromosome pairs in male meiosis are more prone to failure to synapse, and the Prdm9 and Hstx2 genes on the X chromosome have a cis-acting effect on meiotic pairing and synapsis of homologous chromosomes, leading to asynapsis of multiple autosomes and meiotic arrest. They propose a model where cis-controlled pachytene asynapsis is the primary cause of apoptosis of primary spermatocytes and sterility in interspecific hybrids. They also show that analysis of recombinant heterosubspecific/consubspecific chromosome pairs could provide the genetic approach to identifying the cis-acting sites important for meiotic pairing and synapsis. The findings suggest that the X chromosome plays a key role in reproductive isolation between these mouse subspecies, particularly in male meiosis, and the mechanistic basis of hybrid sterility genes is likely cis-acting.
The paper presents a new method called Elastic Network Contact Model (ENCoM) that can predict the effect of mutations on protein stability. The method uses a potential function that considers the surface area in contact between atoms to modulate the interactions between amino acids. This allows it to capture the effect of mutations on stabilizing or destabilizing residues. The authors test the method using protein structures and find that ENCoM performs better than other methods at predicting the effect of mutations on protein stability, particularly for destabilizing mutations. They also find that the contribution of ENCoM to other methods varies depending on the type of mutation, with ENCoM being most effective for stabilizing mutations. The results show that considering the surface area in contact and the modulation of interactions between atom types is important for predicting the effect of mutations on protein stability. The method provides an alternative to existing machine learning and enthalpy-based methods that are biased towards predicting the effect of mutations for destabilizing mutations. The authors also find that a combination of ENCoM with other methods could potentially improve the prediction of mutation effects on stability. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of ENCoM as a new tool for predicting the effect of mutations on protein stability.
The paper describes a model of the thalamocerebellar network that is thought to be involved in essential tremor, a movement disorder that affects one in four people. The model shows that the network of brain regions, including the thalamus, cerebellum, and cortex, is able to oscillate at a frequency of 5.5 Hz, which is in the range of the tremor frequency observed in patients. When the model was stimulated with DBS, the oscillations were disrupted. The study found that low frequency DBS did not abolish the tremor oscillations as readily as higher frequency DBS, which may explain why low frequency stimulation is used clinically to treat essential tremor. Higher frequencies were needed to completely suppress the oscillations. The model showed that the strength of connections between brain regions was critical for the pathological oscillations. The study provides insights into how DBS may work to treat essential tremor by disrupting the synchronous activity in the network. The model also highlights that DBS frequency dependent effects were observed, with low frequency stimulation maintaining the low amplitude high frequency activity while higher frequencies could abolish the oscillations. The study suggests that models like this can help predict how DBS will affect individual patients.
The paper compares clinical and microbiological characteristics of patients with non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) bacteremia and Salmonella Typhi bacteremia at a diarrheal hospital in Bangladesh. Non-typhoid Salmonella bacteremia is a rare occurrence, accounting for less than 0.2% of blood cultures and less than 1% of positive blood cultures, while Salmonella Typhi is more common, accounting for 2% of blood cultures. Patients with NTS bacteremia had a higher fatality rate, were more likely to be malnourished, and had concurrent pneumonia and clinical sepsis. They also had a higher incidence of severe symptoms and signs of infections, such as sepsis, acute kidney injury, and anemia. In contrast, patients with Typhi bacteremia had a lower hematocrit and were less likely to have sepsis. The study found differences in antibiotic susceptibility patterns between NTS and Typhi isolates, which may have implications for empiric treatment of patients suspected to have typhoid fever. Despite some limitations, the findings suggest that NTS bacteremia is an important entity in Bangladesh, particularly in immunocompromised patients, and warrant further investigation.
This paper describes a study on the deadenylase enzyme poly(A) tail shortening enzyme PARN and its role in regulating gene expression in mammalian cells. The authors found that PARN depletion resulted in stabilization of a subset of mRNAs, but surprisingly, most of these stabilized mRNAs showed only a small increase in abundance, rather than a large decrease. This suggests that mRNA decay rates are coupled to transcription rates, with mRNA decay rates and transcription rates being compensated for in a way that maintains appropriate mRNA abundance. The stabilization of certain mRNAs led to changes in the abundance of extracellular proteins required for cell motility and adhesion, which in turn resulted in increased cell migration. The study identified a set of mRNAs whose decay is dependent on PARN deadenylase activity, including the ZFP36l2 mRNA, for which PARN-dependent regulation was found to be mediated through the 3'UTR and poly(A) tail length increase following depletion. The study also found that PARN depletion led to increased translation efficiency, but not a large effect on mRNA abundance for most of the affected mRNAs. The findings suggest that PARN depletion has wide-ranging effects on gene expression, including changes in cell motility, but the mechanism behind this remains unclear. The study provides evidence that transcription and decay are coupled in mammalian cells, and that PARN depletion may modulate translation efficiency in addition to mRNA decay.
The paper discusses how HIV-1 buds and releases from macrophages. Previous studies have suggested that HIV-1 buds into intracellular endosomes and vacuoles in macrophages, but the authors here used an ultrastructural approach to determine the site of budding in primary human macrophages. They found that HIV-1 buds predominantly buds from the plasma membrane of macrophages, not intracellular endosomes. This is supported by the fact that budding sites were frequently found on the plasma membrane, while budding sites were rarely found on gold-filled endosomes. The size of virus-filled structures was also larger than endosomes, and the cellular proteins CD63 and CD4 were found in the virus membrane. The authors conclude that HIV-1 buds from the plasma membrane in macrophages, not just intracellular endosomes. This conclusion suggests a universal morphogenesis pathway for HIV-1, with virus release occurring independently of the host cell.
This paper investigated how mitochondrial protein biogenesis affects the development and survival of zebrafish larvae. The authors used zebrafish to model mitochondrial dysfunction by compromising the activity of the MIA pathway, which imports proteins into the mitochondria. They found that mitochondrial function is compromised in mutants of the mitochondrial protein Mia40a. Mia40a-deficient larvae have enlarged mitochondria in skeletal muscles, glycolytic phenotypes, and decreased pancreas size. The authors identified differences in gene expression between mitochondrial and cytosolic proteins, and found that mitochondrial proteins were downregulated more at the proteomic level. They also observed that the mutants had increased mitochondrial DNA content and utilized glucose as an energy source. The pancreatic phenotype was found to be most strongly affected in acinar cells, which are polarized mitochondria. The authors propose that dysfunction of the MIA pathway may contribute to acinar cell dysfunction and abnormal calcium signaling. The results provide insights into how mitochondrial protein biogenesis affects development and survival in zebrafish and may help develop treatments for human mitochondrial diseases.
This paper analyzed data from a study in Iquitos, Peru to evaluate the utility of routine entomological monitoring of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes as a proxy for the risk of dengue fever infection. The study found that measures of Aedes mosquito density calculated from periodic household surveys, such as the Breteau Index and Container Index, were not associated with the six-month risk of dengue infection. Longitudinal measures of adult mosquito density calculated from multiple surveys within a 12-month period were found to be associated with an increased risk of dengue infection, particularly for adult mosquitoes. However, immature stage measures of larvae and pupae were not associated with dengue infection. The study suggests that routine entomological monitoring is not an adequate proxy for the true exposure risk of dengue infection, as mosquito density measures are subject to measurement error and do not capture the dynamic and spatial variation in mosquito populations. The paper argues that more sophisticated monitoring technologies that can capture mosquito populations over time and space are needed to accurately estimate the risk of dengue transmission. While entomological monitoring remains an important evaluation tool for vector control interventions, it should be considered in light of its limitations and complemented with other methods that can provide more accurate information on human-vector contact and transmission.
The paper proposes a computational framework that uses Gaussian processes to predict the spread of infectious diseases. The framework is based on three scenarios: predicting case counts for unseen provinces, predicting case counts for future time periods, and predicting case counts for unseen provinces and time periods. The authors test their framework on Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever in Turkey. They find that their Gaussian process regression algorithm outperforms other machine learning algorithms in predicting case counts for unseen provinces and time periods. The results suggest that the framework can be useful for public health policy makers to make informed decisions to prevent and control infectious diseases by predicting the number of infected cases.
This study aimed to determine the prevalence of alphavirus and flavivirus exposure in a population in western Kenya. The study found that 69% of participants had antibodies indicating previous exposure to chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and 1.6% had antibodies indicating previous exposure to dengue fever virus (DENV). While flavivirus exposure was low, the study found that adults were more likely to be exposed to CHIKV than children. Recent fever was found to be a significant predictor of infection, suggesting ongoing transmission of alphaviruses and flaviviruses in the area. Grazing in the last 12 months was also found to be a risk factor for exposure. The study suggests that vector abundance and environmental factors like flooding may influence exposure to both alphaviruses and flaviviruses. The study found that proximity to bodies of water was associated with exposure, and that mosquito breeding habitats expand during wet seasons. The study highlights the importance of surveillance for these infections in patients presenting with fever in health facilities to accurately represent the burden and impact of arboviruses in different localities. The low number of flavivirus exposures suggests that alphavirus exposure is common and occurs early in childhood, which may have important yet undetermined health implications.
The paper describes a new approach to identify chromosomal aneuploidies in human cancers that are associated with specific biological processes. They use gene expression data to identify latent factors or sub-signatures that better represent the complexity of the expression patterns seen in human cancers. They then use statistical analysis to identify chromosomal regions that are associated with these latent factors. They find that many of the chromosomal regions associated with the latent factors are also associated with amplified or deleted chromosomes, suggesting that gene dosage caused by aneuploidy may contribute to the coordinated expression of the genes within the factors. By linking the latent factors to the chromosomal regions, they are able to identify specific chromosomal aneuploidies that are associated with specific biological processes, such as hypoxia response. They find that amplification of chromosome 1q is associated with better clinical outcomes in breast cancers, which supports the idea that some aneuploidies may contribute to the hypoxia response. This approach provides a framework for identifying functional aneuploidies that are associated with biological processes and could lead to better therapies.
The paper discusses how proteins called intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) can play functional roles in cancer, particularly the Ewing's Sarcoma (EWS) family of proteins. EWS proteins have a disordered domain called the Ewing's activation domain (EAD) that binds to various partners. The authors studied the EAD and found that it primarily binds to its partners through cation-π interactions between aromatic residues on the EAD and basic residues on the target protein. This cation-π interaction is dynamic and involves multiple aromatic residues on the EAD. They developed a model that describes how the EAD binds to a generic globular protein target through multiple cation-π interactions. The model shows that the binding energy depends on the number of aromatic residues on the EAD and the density of basic residues on the target. The model provides a biophysical basis for the functional interactions of the EAD and may help identify therapeutic targets for EWS tumors. The authors suggest that the polycation-π model could be a general mechanism for IDP-protein interactions and may be relevant to other IDPs.
This paper discusses how people's tendency to favor immediate rewards over long-term goals can be explained by the brain's ability to simulate future events. The authors developed a task where participants were shown options with either a picture or a textual description, and then asked to choose between a short-term or long-term payoff. They found that when the long-term payoff had to be simulated in their minds, people favored the long-term option more, which they did when the option was described with more details. This simulation-based valuation was associated with increased activity in the hippocampus, a brain region that is important for memory and future thinking. The authors also found that patients with hippocampal damage, such as Alzheimer's disease, were more impulsive in situations where they had to simulate future events, suggesting that the hippocampus helps people resist the attraction of immediate rewards. This study provides evidence that some of people's impulsivity in everyday life can be attributed to their ability to simulate future events, which they use to value delayed options more than immediate ones.
The paper discusses how the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC) regulates calcium homeostasis in muscle cells and contributes to muscular dystrophy. The DAPC complex is a multimeric protein found in muscle membranes that interacts with calcium channels and signaling molecules. Studies have shown that dystrophin mutations lead to elevated intracellular calcium levels, muscle weakness and wasting, and vasospasm. The authors identified a novel protein called ISLO-1 that interacts with the calcium channel SLO-1 and helps localize it to the muscle membrane. They found that ISLO-1 mutations disrupt the localization of SLO-1 and cause muscle hypercontraction, headbending, and excessive calcium influx. They propose that the DAPC and ISLO-1 regulate calcium homeostasis by localizing SLO-1 to specific regions in the muscle membrane, preventing muscle overexcitation and cellular damage. Defects in the DAPC or ISLO-1 disrupt this localization and allow abnormal calcium influx, leading to muscle weakness and muscle wasting. The study provides a mechanism by which the DAPC regulates calcium homeostasis and contributes to muscular dystrophy.
This paper investigated the role of the protein CBP20 in the ethylene signaling pathway in plant growth. Ethylene is a hormone that regulates plant growth and development, and the authors found that CBP20 is phosphorylated at a specific site by ethylene receptors. The phosphorylation of CBP20 is required for the growth inhibition caused by ethylene in roots. They identified a specific microRNA, miR39b, that targets the protein MYB3 and is involved in this growth regulation. The authors showed that miR39b is upregulated by ethylene and targets MYB3 for degradation in roots, leading to the ethylene-induced root phenotype in cbp20 mutants. The study provides evidence that the phosphorylation of CBP20 is involved in ethylene signaling and that miR39b plays a role in root growth regulation.
The paper proposes a new method called MiMBl (Minimization of Metabolites Balance) to model metabolic networks. The method formulates biological objectives as a linear combination of metabolite turnover rates, rather than fluxes. This makes the results less sensitive to the stoichiometric representation of reactions. The authors show that the existing optimization-based methods are sensitive to the stoichiometry, leading to inconsistent predictions when using different stoichiometric matrices. MiMBl formulates the objective function as a linear combination of metabolite turnover rates, which is robust to the stoichiometry. The method is demonstrated on a yeast metabolic model and shows that it can predict more genetic interactions than existing methods. The authors argue that the use of stoichiometry-independent formulations is important for linking modeling results to biological interpretation and making predictions that are consistent across different stoichiometric representations. The method provides a framework for consistent formulation of biological objective functions and can help unravel genotype-phenotype relationships in metabolic networks.
The paper discusses how the protein Rad9 plays a role in the DNA damage response and checkpoint mechanism in yeast. Rad9 is a protein that is activated by DNA damage and interacts with other proteins to activate the checkpoint response. The paper shows that Rad9 binding to chromatin is influenced by different mechanisms in different cell cycles. In G1 cells, Rad9 binding to chromatin is mainly achieved through interaction with histone marks, while in M cells, Rad9 binding is more dependent on CDK1 phosphorylation. In M cells, Rad9 binding to chromatin is mainly through CDK1 phosphorylation of a specific residue, Ser1. This phosphorylation of Ser1 is required for Rad9 binding to interact with a protein called Dpb1, which is also phosphorylated by CDK1. The paper shows that Dpb1 plays a role in the DNA damage response in M cells, but not in G1 cells. The study concludes that Rad9 and Dpb1 interaction is influenced by cell cycle stage and phosphorylation status, and that Dpb1 plays an alternative role in M cells to recruit Rad9 to sites of DNA damage.
The paper describes a new method to simultaneously profile genetic and epigenetic variation in Arabidopsis thaliana. The authors used a technique called enzyme methylome profiling to identify sites where DNA methylation is either constitutive (present in all genotypes) or polymorphic (present in only one genotype). They found that constitutive methylation is more common in pericentromeric regions and decreases towards gene-rich regions, while polymorphic methylation is more common in gene-poor regions. They found that polymorphic methylation sites tend to be phase-specific, indicating a local effect. They also found that polymorphic methylation is more common in coding regions and introns than exons. They observed that methylation polymorphisms tend to be inherited in an additive manner in hybrids rather than a dominant manner, indicating that they likely affect a single chromosome. They found that genic methylation polymorphisms are enriched for biological processes such as transcription regulation and binding. The study suggests that DNA methylation polymorphisms may contribute to natural gene expression variation and propagate developmental and environmental influences. The authors propose that methylation serves as a memory mechanism to modulate gene expression plasticity and gene expression regulatory networks.
The paper discusses the potential benefits of using adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASC) to treat Chagas disease, a parasitic infection that can cause cardiac damage and inflammation. The researchers found that injecting ASC into mice infected with the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi at 3 days post-infection reduced inflammation and fibrosis in the heart, parasite load, and cytokine production in vitro and in vivo. This suggests that the cells may be able to modulate the immune response to control the parasite and prevent tissue damage. The ASC injection also improved cardiac function, preventing remodeling and dilatation of the right ventricle. The study suggests that the cells may be effective in preventing or reducing the damage caused by Chagas disease, but more research is needed to fully understand their mechanism of action and determine if they could be used in humans. The injection of ASC at 3 days post-infection is unlikely to be practical in the clinical setting, as the immune response against the parasite is still developing at that time. Larger studies in more relevant animal models may be needed to determine if the approach could be therapeutically applicable.
This paper analyzed data from Southern hemisphere countries during the 2009 H1N1pd influenza pandemic to investigate how differences in population demographics affected the spread of the virus. The researchers used mathematical modeling to compare how the virus spread between countries with different population structures and contact patterns. They found that countries with more children had higher estimated reproduction numbers and infection rates, suggesting that demographics played a significant role in the differences observed in the spread of the virus. While the modeling was simplistic and did not capture all factors, the results suggest that demographics, notably the proportion of children in the population, were a key factor in determining the spread of the virus. The study provides insight into how factors like population age structure and contact patterns may impact the spread of diseases like influenza.
The paper discusses how hepatitis C virus (HCV) can spread from cell to cell within infected cells and how this cell-to-cell transmission plays a major role in resistance to direct acting antivirals (DAAs) used to treat HCV infection. The authors generated HCV variants that were resistant to direct acting antivirals and tested their ability to spread through cell-to-cell transmission. They found that DAA-resistant HCV variants spread more efficiently through cell-to-cell transmission than through cell-free transmission, even in the presence of neutralizing antibodies that block cell-free transmission. They also found that blocking cell-to-cell transmission using host-targeting entry inhibitors (HTEIs) could prevent the emergence of drug resistance in cell culture models. This suggests that blocking the spread of DAA-resistant HCV through cell-cell transmission may be a new strategy to enhance the activity of DAAs and prevent resistance. The study also shows that different HTEIs have different genetic barriers for resistance, with some being more effective at preventing resistance than others. The results suggest that combining DAAs with HTEs may provide a novel strategy to treat difficult-to-treat HCV patients and address limitations of current DAAs. The study provides evidence and directions for future applications of HTEIs in HCV therapy, particularly for non-genotype 1 infections, and has implications for the treatment of other viral infections.
The paper discusses how different types of HLA-B molecules on the surface of cells are affected by TAP inhibition or deficiency. The authors found that some HLA-B molecules, called RIT molecules, are more resistant to TAP inhibition or deficiency, while others are more sensitive. This is due to their intrinsic stabilities and peptide-binding preferences. RIT molecules tend to have higher stability and broader peptide-binding specificities, allowing them to survive under TAP-deficient conditions. This allows them to maintain higher surface expression levels, even at physiological temperatures, compared to other HLA-B molecules. They propose that the different types of HLA-B molecules have evolved distinct assembly pathways to counter pathogen evasion strategies. RIT molecules are expected to provide a source of partially empty class I molecules, which can still trigger CD8+ T cell activation under TAP-deficient conditions, even if the antigenic peptides are limited. This may be an advantage for immune surveillance under conditions of TAP inhibition or TAP deficiency. The results demonstrate that HLA-B molecules have evolved to assemble via distinct pathways that are dependent on their intrinsic structural features and intracellular assembly characteristics.
The paper discusses how the immunoglobulin enzyme activation-induced cytidine AID (AID) is regulated by the cell cycle. AID can initiate DNA damage and mutations in immunoglobulin genes by deaminating cytidine to uracil. AID can be activated in different stages of the cell cycle, and this can have different outcomes, including chromosomal translocations and somatic hypermutation. The paper shows that AID is more stable in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and this stability affects how well AID can initiate DNA damage and mutations. AID is most active in G1 phase and this allows it to initiate Ig gene diversification without compromising cell viability. However, AID is less stable in later stages of the cell cycle, which can lead to mutations and DNA damage that compromise cell viability. The paper identifies two mechanisms for regulating AID stability, phosphorylation at specific sites and AID's own catalytic activity. The paper also shows that cell cycle regulation of AID stability determines its ability to initiate DNA damage in different stages of the cell cycle, with G1 phase being most important for initiating Ig gene diversification without compromising viability. The paper also discusses the potential of using cell cycle tags to study AID regulation and AID-induced DNA damage.
The paper describes how the plant Arabidopsis thaliana uses a system of selector genes to determine the fate of cells in the epidermis. The selector genes GL3 and GL1 are found to regulate the differentiation of cells into trichomes, which are small hair-like structures on the leaves. The authors use a combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation and gene expression analysis to identify direct targets of GL3 and GL1. They find that GL3 and GL1 directly regulate 53 genes, which they call "trichome genes", which are involved in various cellular processes including metabolism, cellular communication and signal transduction. The study identifies new targets of GL3 and GL1, including genes that express early and late during trichome formation. They also find that GL3 and GL1 activate the expression of many genes that inhibit cell division and promote endoreduplication, suggesting that the early switch from mitosis to endocycle is involved in trichome initiation. They propose a hierarchical regulatory network with GL3 and GL1 at the top, with GL2, TG2 and SCL8 as second tier regulators, and the trichome genes as third tier. The study provides new insights into how selector genes regulate trichome formation and expands the known regulatory network.
The paper describes a study that aimed to investigate the cellular tropism of Orientia tsugamushi, the bacteria that causes scrub typhus, within eschar biopsies from patients. The study found that within the eschar biopsies, Orientia co-localized mainly with monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells, rather than endothelial cells, at the early stage of infection. These cells have the ability to recirculate systemically via the lymphatic vessels, which helps explain the rapid clearance of Orientia from the eschar and early dissemination to other organs. However, the study also showed that the main site of replication of Orientia prior to dissemination is likely within infected, recirculated APCs in the regional lymph nodes, rather than within the eschar itself. The findings suggest that endothelial cells are not a preferred site for Orientia infection and that infected APCs are the main source of replication and dissemination. The study provides evidence that monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells are the main cell types infected in the early stage of infection, but further research is needed to determine the cell types infected in lymph nodes and other organs following dissemination. The findings offer insights into the immunopathophysiology of scrub typhus and the potential for developing good animal models to study the disease.
This paper describes the identification of a mouse model for a human mitochondrial disease caused by a mutation in the gene Slc25a46. The mutation was identified through a forward genetic approach that involved random mutagenesis and screening of mice for ataxia, ataxic seizures, and lymphoid abnormalities. The Slc25a6 gene was found to cause the identified phenotype when mutated, and the mutant mice were rescued by expressing the human Slc25a6 gene. The mouse model displays optic atrophy, cerebellar hypoplasia, and lymphoid abnormalities, which are similar to the clinical features seen in human patients. The authors analyzed the mouse tissues to understand the molecular basis of the disease and found that the mutation affects mitochondrial dynamics and cristae maintenance. They identified changes in mitochondrial proteins involved in fusion and fission, as well as increased levels of mitochondrial interactors. The study provides a genetic model for the human disease and demonstrates that the Slc25a6 mutation causes changes the mitochondrial interactome in the cerebellum.
The paper discusses how rabies has been a serious threat to Chinese public health, with three large epidemics since 1945. However, rabies control efforts in animals have been neglected in most regions of China, leading to new cases in previously rabies-free provinces. In northwestern China, rabies is transmitted by stray dogs and wild foxes, causing economic losses to local herdsmen. Vaccinating the herds and reservoir animals could prevent these losses. However, there is currently no oral vaccine for rabies in stray dogs and wild animals in China, and vaccines for large animals are still in development. The paper reports rabies outbreaks in camels and cattle in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, caused by dog bites and wild foxes, and finds that a single dose of canine inactivated vaccine can induce protective immunity in both species. However, larger vaccine doses are needed for cattle and camels to provide long-term protection. The paper argues that more research is needed on oral vaccines for dogs and foxes to prevent rabies in domestic animals and regular surveillance of cross-border transmission between China and neighboring countries is required to control wildlife rabies.
The paper aims to advance genomics-based methods for understanding ecological associations between microbes in the environment. The authors introduce two new indices to predict microbial co-occurrence: genome content similarity and microbe-microbe functional association. They show that both indices can predict co-occurrence of microbes even when accounting for phylogenetic relationships between the organisms. Genome content similarity explains more variance in co-occurrence than previously proposed metabolic competition and complementarity indices constructed from KEGG pathways. The findings highlight the importance of habitat filtering in microbial community assembly and suggest that genome content information can be used to predict ecological interactions between microbes. However, the explanatory power of the indices is still relatively low, indicating the need for further improvement of genomic techniques to understand the inner workings of microbial communities. The authors also identify potential candidates for further functional studies by analyzing putative pathways exhibiting high genome similarity between co-occurring taxa. The study demonstrates that genome content similarity and functional association indices can be used to predict microbial co-occurrence and provide insights into the mechanisms driving ecological associations, complementing ecological surveys.
This paper discusses how different types of cells in mammals require different mechanisms for cytokinesis (cell division) in order to proliferate. The researchers found that fibroblasts, which grow in contact with other cells and in extracellular matrices, require septins for proper cytokinesis. However, hematopoietic cells, which grow planktonically in suspension, can proliferate without septins. The researchers identified stathmin as a key protein that allows hematopoietic cells to proliferate without septins. They showed that stathmin overexpression can rescue the mitotic failure of septin-deficient fibroblasts, indicating that it enables hematopoietic cells to proliferate independently of septins. The researchers conclude that septins play a context-dependent role in mammalian cytokines and that stathmin is a critical permissive factor for hematopoietic cell proliferation. The study suggests that targeting stathmin could be a potential strategy for developing anti-tumor therapy that selectively targets tumor cells without harming hematopoietic cells.
The paper discusses the diversity of genes in Salmonella that modify the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) molecule on the surface of the bacteria. The LPS molecule is important for immune recognition and virulence. The authors identified 59 genes that modify the LPS molecule, called glycosyltransferases (Gtr), in Salmonella genomes using BLAST searches and genome analysis. They found that these genes are distributed across multiple serovars and species, but are not reflected in the standard classification system that groups Salmonella based on LPS structure. The Gtr genes are found in genomes of Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica and serovars, as well as bacteriophages that infect Salmonella. The genes are also found in different regions of the genome and are often clustered into 10 distinct families. However, the genes do not perfectly match the current classification system, indicating that there is more complexity in LPS modification than currently recognized. The authors propose that the Gtr genes contribute to Salmonella virulence and persistence, and that a degree of redundancy may exist in the Gtr system. They also found that phase variation in the Gtr genes allows for the expression of different Gtr products, which may help explain the variability in LPS modification observed in some studies. This variability is not captured in current serotyping methods and highlights the need for more advanced methods to detect LPS diversity in Salmonella.
This paper describes an investigation into the efficacy and safety of a new drug called Epicatechin (EPI) against Schistosoma mansoni, a parasite that causes schistosomiasis. The researchers tested the drug in mice at various concentrations (40, 100, and 300 mg/kg) to see how well it reduced parasite burden, egg laying, and liver pathology. They found that the highest concentration (8000 mg/kg) significantly reduced parasite burden and egg laying, but caused toxicity in mice. Lower concentrations (40 and 100 mg/kg) also reduced parasite burden, but did not cause toxicity. The drug significantly reduced liver pathology, especially granulomas. The authors conclude that EPI is a promising candidate drug that could potentially be used to treat schistosomiasis, but more studies are needed to determine its efficacy and mechanism of action.
The paper discusses a protein called 2CATPase that is encoded by enteroviruses like the poliovirus. The researchers found that this protein has two different activities, one that unwinds RNA double helices in an ATP-dependent manner and another that stabilizes RNA strands in an ATP-independent manner. They call these activities "RNA helicase" and "RNA chaperone" respectively. They showed that 2CATPase has both of these activities in vitro and in cells, and that the RNA chaperone activity is important for the enterovirus life cycle. The RNA helicase activity of 2CATPase unwinds RNA double helices in an ATP-dependent manner, while the chaperone activity stabilizes RNA strands in an ATP-independent manner. They propose that the RNA chaperone activity of 2CATPase plays a critical role in facilitating the recycling of viral RNA templates during replication, while the helicase activity helps unwinds RNA double helices to allow efficient progeny virus synthesis. This dual activity of 2CATPase provides new insights into the mechanism of enterovirus RNA remodeling and replication.
This paper investigates the auxin signaling system in the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha, a species that has a simplified auxin-mediated transcriptional regulation compared to flowering plants. The study finds that Marchantia has a single AUX/IAA protein (MpIAA) and three ARF (MpARF1, MpARF2, and MpARF3) homologs, which are phylogenetically diverged and have different transcriptional activities. MpIAA interacts with all three MpARFs, and represses auxin responses by domain II, similar to Arabidopsis AUX/IAA. MpIAA regulates cell expansion and differentiation in Marchantia, including gemmaling growth and ventral tissue development. The study also finds that MpIAA expression is graded along the apical-basal axis during sporophyte development, and represses sporophy development when auxin is inhibited. The results suggest that Marchantia has a minimal but complete auxin-mediated transcriptional system, which allows for investigating the evolution and mechanisms of morphogenesis controlled by auxin.
The paper investigates the role of calcium signaling in the life cycles of apicomplexan parasites, which are responsible for malaria. The researchers found that two calcium-handling proteins called calcium ATPases (CaTAs) are essential for sexual development in these parasites, but not for asexual reproduction. They identified two CaTAs, PfCAX and TgCAX, in apicomplex parasites and characterized their function in heterologous expression systems like yeast. They found that PfCAX is a calcium/hydrogen exchanger that localizes to the mitochondrial inner membrane and provides calcium tolerance to the parasite when it is exposed to high external calcium concentrations. They showed that PfCAX is essential for ookinete conversion, but not required for zygote or female gamete development. The study demonstrates that CaTAs play a key role in calcium signaling in apicomplex parasite development and provide a potential target for drug development to block parasite transmission. The researchers hope that this new understanding of CaTAs will aid in the development of novel malaria transmission-blocking therapies.
The paper found that more than 50% of schoolchildren in the area studied had intestinal parasitic infections, with the highest prevalence in government-owned schools. The study showed that the poor sanitation conditions in these schools, including lack of water, latrines, and garbage around the schools, allowed for better transmission of the infections. The infections were also found to be higher among boys than girls, especially in government schools. The study suggests that school health programs aimed at improving sanitation and hygiene practices in government schools would be effective in reducing the prevalence of parasitic infections among schoolchildren. The study also found that girls were underrepresented in government-owned schools, likely due to cultural attitudes that prioritize marriage and domestic work over education. The authors recommend a multi-pronged approach to address the issue, including periodic deworming, health education, and improving water and sanitation conditions.
The paper proposes a learning system that uses slow feature analysis (SFA) to extract relevant features from high-dimensional visual input streams. The SFA network reduces the dimensionality of the input state space to a few highly informative features. This extracted representation is then used by a reinforcement learning network to make decisions based on rewards. The authors show that using SFA to extract features allows the learning system to learn complex control tasks on high-dimensional visual inputs without the need for hand-designed state representations. They apply the system to two tasks, the Morris water maze task and the variable targets task, and show that the system can learn to navigate the maze and reach targets in a similar number of episodes as previous simulations. They argue that slow feature learning, combined with reward-based learning, may be a general unsupervised principle for behavioral learning in the brain. The results suggest that SFA could be an important unsupervised mechanism for learning in sensory cortices, especially the visual pathway.
The paper discusses how the ability of RNA molecules to maintain their structure regardless of their surrounding sequence context is important for their function. The authors developed a method called the self-containment index to measure how well RNA molecules maintain their structure when embedded in different sequences. They found that miRNAs, which undergo two cleavage steps during biogenesis, exhibit a high degree of self containment, meaning they can maintain their structure regardless of the surrounding sequence. This is not seen in other RNA molecules that do not have this biogenesis constraint. They propose that high self containment is an evolved property of miRNAs that allows them to function in different genomic contexts and allows them to be modular units that can be inserted into new genomic locations. They also found that miRNAs with high self containment tend to be part of functional families and are more conserved, while low self containment is associated with genomic instability and non-functional miRNAs. They suggest that the ability of miRNAs to maintain their structure over many genomic contexts reflects an explicit mechanism to buffer against changes, allowing them to function even when inserted into new contexts.
The paper describes an updated version of the qFit algorithm called qFit 2.0 that can model peptide flips and glycine conformations to identify alternative backbone conformations in crystal structures. Previous versions of qFit only sampled conformations based on anisotropy of the Cβ atom. In qFit 2.0, conformations are sampled based on the electron density for both the backbone O atom and sidechain atoms. This allows the algorithm to identify discrete peptide flips that occur outside of helices and sheets, which were previously missed. qFit 2.0 also samples conformations based on the electron density for glycines, which enables modeling of discrete flexibility of the amino acid. The new algorithm identifies alternative backbone conformations for 75% of glycines, compared to only 4% in the original deposited structures. The backbone shifts identified by qFit 2.0 also drive the discovery of additional sidechain conformations, suggesting a tight coupling between backbone and sidechain degrees of freedom in proteins. The results demonstrate that qFit 2.0 can model larger backbone conformational changes and identify more conformational heterogeneity in protein structures, which could provide insights into protein function.
The paper describes how researchers identified a mechanism for how the compound acozibor, a potential anti-trypanosomal drug, is metabolized by the parasite Trypanosoma brucei. They used a genome-scale loss-of-function screen to identify genes that sensitize the parasite to acozibor. They found that one gene, TbALDH3, when knocked down, sensitized the parasite to the compound. Further analysis showed that TbALDH3 encodes a Flavin adenine dinucleotide-dependent amine oxidase that metabolizes the compound. This enzyme is localized in the glycosomes of the parasite. The researchers showed that the parasite culture system can be used to model the metabolism of the compound in vivo and that the host provides the enzymatic activity necessary to activate the compound. They propose that similar metabolic pathways may exist in other pathogens and drugs, and could be exploited to improve their efficacy. The study highlights the importance of understanding drug metabolism mechanisms for drug development and resistance.
The paper discusses how new computational tools can be used to predict which genetic mutations are likely to cause problems with gene splicing, which can lead to disease. The researchers analyzed a gene called MLH1, which is associated with Lynch syndrome, a rare genetic disorder. They identified 17 genetic mutations in the gene's exon 10 that affect splicing, most of which occur outside the standard splice sites. They found that a computational approach called ΔtESRseq is good at predicting which mutations will cause exon skipping, while another called ΔHZEI is better at predicting which mutations will cause exon inclusion. The ΔΨ approach was not as accurate. They tested these approaches on MLH1 mutations and found that they could predict the splicing defects in both in the lab experiments and in patient samples. This suggests that these computational methods could be useful for prioritizing genetic variants for functional analysis to identify which ones are likely to cause disease.
This paper proposes a new approach to identify potential causal relationships between a disease and a biological intermediate. The approach uses genome-wide allelic scores constructed from hundreds or thousands of anonymous SNPs that relate to a biological intermediate, rather than known variants. The allelic scores are weighted based on the effect size of the variants in genome-wide association studies that tagged the intermediate. The authors show that allelic scores can explain non-trivial proportions of variance in the intermediate, even when known variants are excluded from the construction of the scores. They find that allelic scores constructed from known variants explain more variance in the intermediate than weighted allelic scores, indicating that the known variants are likely to be pleiotropic. However, allelic scores constructed from anonymous SNPs can still explain meaningful proportions of variance, even though they are less specific. The approach has the potential to identify causal relationships between diseases and biological intermediates that are not captured by known variants. The authors argue that the approach could be useful for identifying potential interventions or treatments by translating genetic research into clinical impact.
The paper discusses how helminth-derived cathelicin-like peptides from parasitic worms have adapted to their parasitic lifestyle by losing their direct antimicrobial activity but acquiring immune modulatory properties. While mammalian cathelicin-like peptides have antimicrobial and immune modulatory functions, helminth-derived peptides have lost their antimicrobial activity and instead focus on regulating the immune response to prevent excessive inflammation. The helminth-derived peptides inhibit macrophage activation and inflammatory cytokine production, similar to mammalian cathelicins, but they do not show bactericidal activity. The authors suggest that this adaptation may have occurred as a result of the helminth's need to regulate the immune response to prevent cell death during in the host in order to support their long-term survival. The findings provide an opportunity to design novel immunotherapeutics that exploit the immune-modulatory properties of helminth-derived peptides without their cytotoxicity, potentially for treating microbial infections and immune-related disorders.
The study compared the effectiveness of community-based adherence clubs versus clinic-based adherence clubs for stable HIV patients on antiretroviral therapy in South Africa. While the study found that community-based adherence clubs had a higher loss rate of 52% compared to 43% for clinic-based adherence clubs, the difference was not statistically significant. The majority of patients who were lost from club-based care missed a club visit and did not pick up their medication, suggesting logistical issues and convenience were the main reasons. However, the study found that clinic-based adherence clubs had a lower loss rate from any ART care, with 72% reengaging in care within 90 days compared to 58% for community-based clubs. The study suggests that while community-based adherence clubs may provide a convenient and flexible care model, clinic-based adherence clubs may be more effective at retaining patients in care, particularly if logistics and convenience are improved. However, the study had limitations in terms of follow-up duration, treatment assignment and data on adverse events. The study highlights the importance of understanding patient factors and preferences when designing differentiated care models for HIV treatment. As ART becomes more widely available, it will be important to efficiently deliver reliable and effective care to meet global targets of viral suppression.
The paper investigates the biological and medical properties of Trypanosoma cruzi strains from the Amazon region that cause Chagas disease. The researchers isolated and characterized TcI and TcIV strains from patients in the Amazonas region and compared their biological properties to determine if there are differences in virulence and pathogenicity between the two strains. They found that TcIV strains have higher parasitemia and mortality in the acute phase, but lower parasitemia and inflammatory response in the chronic phase compared to TcI strains. However, TcIV strains also had higher resistance to benznidazole chemotherapy. The study suggests that the biological differences between the two strains are proportional to their evolutionary divergence and can be predicted based on their genetic makeup. The findings highlight the importance of considering the genetic diversity of T. cruzi strains in the Amazon region when studying the clinical diversity of Chagas disease, diagnosis, prognosis and drug trials.
The paper analyzed the mitochondrial DNA of 5106 individuals from various diseases and found that some mitochondrial DNA variants were associated with multiple diseases. This suggests that the same genetic variants in mitochondria may contribute to the risk of developing several common complex diseases. The study found that 61% of the disease-associated mitochondrial variants increased the risk of disease while only 38% decreased the risk. The study used multiple arrays to genotype the mitochondrial DNA and imputed missing genotypes to capture more of the mitochondrial genetic variation. The variants associated with increased risk were found to be in genes involved in energy production and complexes I and IV. The study also found variants in non-coding regions of mitochondrial DNA associated with disease. The findings suggest that mitochondria play a key role in common diseases and that genetic variation in mitochondria may contribute to the "missing heritability" of complex diseases.
The paper describes the development of two new ELISA tests, the BLACKBOX CCHFV IgM and BLACKBOX CCHV IgG, to detect Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHV) infections. The tests use a recombinant CCHV nucleoprotein antigen produced in E. coli as the antigen. The tests were evaluated using a serum panel from 15 patients with confirmed CCHV infections in Kosovo and compared to in-house gold standard CCHV IgM/IgG IIFT and commercial ELISA kits. The results show that both BLACKBOX tests have comparable sensitivity and specificity to the gold standard tests, with the BLACKBOX CCHV IgG ELISA showing higher sensitivity in detecting IgG antibodies in early samples from acute patients. The BLACKBOX tests have the advantage of being easier to perform with fewer assay steps and components, making them more practical for use in laboratories. The tests also show good performance in detecting CCHV antibodies from different strains from different geographic regions, suggesting they could be useful for seroprevalence studies.
The paper discusses the difficulty of identifying the type of interaction represented in an ecological network, for example whether it is mutualistic or antagonistic. While this task was shown to be easy for simple networks of actors, the same approach failed to classify ecological networks. The authors argue that this is because ecological networks typically quantify interactions in a multidimensional manner, while the simple networks used in the experiments were undirected and unweighted. They propose that weighted, multidimensional networks could provide the necessary information to classify ecological networks. However, they also suggest that the difference between mutualistic and antagonistic networks may not be the main driver of network structure and more meaningful classifications could emerge. The authors conclude that a solution to this challenge would have important implications for ecology, but a failure could provide insights into how networks are constructed and what they represent.
The paper discusses the function of the FAST protein, a small protein that mediates cell-cell fusion in reovirus infection. The FAST protein is an unusual type of fusion protein that does not have the typical structural features of other enveloped virus fusion proteins, but instead functions as an autonomous fusion machine. The authors show that the FAST protein still mediates cell-cell fusion, but relies on non-cognate adhesion factors to do so. They propose a two-stage model where the FAST protein first mediates cell attachment, and then the cell adhesion factors enhance the fusion reaction by providing extended cell-cell contact sites. The adhesion factors do not directly interact with the FAST protein, but exploit the FAST protein to bring the cells into close proximity. The authors suggest that this two-stage model is better suited to the function of the FAST protein as a cellular fusion protein, allowing it to function in a more gradual and flexible manner.
The paper discusses how a retroelement-derived gene called L1TD1 became a protein-coding gene that is essential for pluripotency maintenance in human embryonic stem cells. The gene L1TD1 was found to have evolved from a retroelement called L1, which is a mobile genetic element that can insert itself into the genome. The L1TD1 gene was first domesticated in the common ancestor of placental mammals and later became essential for pluripotency maintenance in human stem cells. However, L1TD1 has been lost in some mammalian lineages, suggesting that the loss of active L1 elements may have led to the loss of L1TD1. The authors propose that L1TD1 was originally domesticated as a genetic defense mechanism against L1 retroelements, but later evolved to restrict L1 elements in pluripotent stem cells through transcriptional or post-transcriptional silencing. The loss of L1TD1 in some mammalian lineages may be due to the loss of L1 retroelement activity, while in others it is maintained due to the presence of genes near L1s that are important for pluripotency maintenance. The evolutionary history of L1TD1 is complex, with evidence of positive selection in primates and mice, suggesting that L1TD1 may have evolved to restrict L1 elements in response to changing retroelement activity. The authors hypothesize that the original function of L1TD1 was genome defense, but it became adapted to restrict L1 elements in pluripotent stem cells through a mechanism involving transcriptional or post-transcriptional silencing.
This paper describes a study on how the researchers identified a gene that is responsible for a plant's ability to efficiently use phosphorus, an essential nutrient for plant growth. They used a combination of genetic mapping, genomic sequencing and expression analysis to identify a gene called GmACP1. They found that GmACP1 was expressed more in response to low phosphorus levels and that overexpression of the gene increased the plant's ability to use phosphorus. They identified several favorable alleles of the gene that were associated with higher phosphorus efficiency in the plant population. They also developed markers that could be used to breed plants with higher phosphorus efficiency. This approach could potentially be used to develop crops that can grow more sustainably in low-phosphorus soils.
The paper discusses genetic testing for early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) caused by mutations in genes PSEN1, PSEN2, and APP. The authors analyzed DNA from 129 EOAD patients with an age of onset below 51 years and identified 10 novel mutations in these genes, including 4 PSEN1, 2 PSEN2, and 20 APP mutations. They found that 5 of the mutations occurred de novo, meaning they occurred spontaneously without a family history of the mutation. This suggests that sporadic cases of EOAD may also carry these mutations, which is important for genetic counseling and preventive trials. While some mutations were classified as pathogenic or probable based on genetic algorithms, many remained uncertain due to lack of functional evidence. The authors conclude that including sporadic cases in genetic screening is necessary and that functional assessment of variants is needed to improve classification.
The paper describes how a transcription factor called Ultraspiracle (USP) influences the age at which honey bees initiate foraging. USP regulates the expression of genes related to behavioral maturation in both the fat bodies and brains of bees. The researchers found that USP regulates genes by interacting with other transcription factors in a complex manner, likely involving interactions with multiple heterodimers. They identified a number of genes that are differentially expressed in the fat bodies and brains of bees in response to USP knockdown, JH treatment, or nutrient deprivation, suggesting that similar transcriptional mechanisms underlie changes in both tissues. They propose a model where USP interacts with a complex of transcription factors, including MET, to mediate JH signaling and influence gene expression. This model could explain how USP regulates gene expression in both tissues, despite USP binding the same genomic locations in nurses and foragers. The findings provide insights into the mechanisms linking social behavior to genes and gene networks and suggest that transcriptional regulation underlies behavioral maturation in honey bees. The study demonstrates how a complex of proteins, including USP, MET, Chd64, and FKBP39, mediate JH signaling, providing a missing link in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying honey bee behavioral maturation.
The paper investigates the mechanisms by which the parasitic flatworm Schistosoma mansoni controls its life cycle, specifically the process of egg production. The authors find that both the Src kinase signaling pathway and the TGF beta signaling pathway are involved in regulating transcription of genes involved in egg formation. They use inhibitors to block the Src kinase and TGF beta receptor activity and analyze the resulting changes in gene expression using microarray and qPCR. They find that both pathways contribute to the regulation of egg production, with the TGF beta pathway having a stronger effect. The TGF beta pathway controls the expression of several genes involved in eggshell formation, including the eggshell precursor gene similar to fs80, while the Src kinase pathway has a more balanced effect. The study provides evidence that the TGF beta pathway and Src kinase pathway cooperate to control egg production in a balanced manner, with the TGF beta pathway being more dominant. The results suggest that the TGF beta pathway may be a promising target for drugs that could interfere with Schistosoma mansoni reproduction and potentially reduce the transmission of the parasite.
The paper describes a new framework that uses a model of pulse wave propagation to analyze the cardiovascular system from a single peripheral pulse wave recording. The model allows for the estimation of arterial stiffness and other cardiovascular biomarkers from a single pulse wave measurement, without the need for simultaneous electrocardiogram recordings. The authors tested this framework in hemodialysis patients and found that it could correctly identify increased arterial stiffness during hemodialysis sessions, which was not seen with standard pulse wave analysis methods. The framework also identified that changes in pulse wave velocity and other biomarkers during hemodialysis sessions could be related to changes in blood flow during the treatment. The study suggests that this approach may provide valuable insights into cardiovascular state and impact of therapy that are not captured by standard pulse wave analysis. However, there are some limitations to the framework, such as the assumption that the peripheral pressure waveform is not influenced by vascular access and the limited information in the pulse wave recording that makes it difficult to estimate all model parameters. Further testing is needed to confirm the findings and validate the approach.
This paper describes a new model of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in Drosophila melanogaster, a fruit fly, which allows researchers to study both the bacterial and host responses during biofilm infections. The authors found that oral infection of Drosophila by Pseudomonas aeruginosa resulted in biofilm formation in the fly's crop, which was characterized by the presence of extracellular DNA and polysaccharides and resistance to antibiotics. This biofilm infection led to increased expression of Drosophila immune genes that fight infection. In contrast, non-biofilm forming Pseudomonas mutants resulted in decreased immune gene expression and faster mortality. Co-infection of flies with biofilm-forming Pseudomonas and a non-biofilm-forming mutant restored immune gene expression and survival, suggesting that biofilm formation may serve as a specific immune signal to the host. The results suggest that biofilms may slow dissemination and systemic infection, while the loss of biofilm may induce inflammation in the crop. This model has the potential to increase understanding of the relationship between biofilms and the host during infection.
This paper investigates the potential of using anti-fungal drugs called conazoles as a new treatment for Naegleria fowleri, a parasite that causes primary amebic meningoencephalitis in humans. The authors chemically validate the sterol biosynthesis pathway as a druggable target in N. fowleri and systematically assess the efficacy of conazoles against the parasite. They find that all conazoles tested demonstrate anti-N. fowleri activity with potency exceeding that of the standard treatment amphotericin B, and that the most potent conazoles have lipophilic properties that favor binding to the heme site of the enzyme. They determine the binding affinity of the conazoles to the enzyme using UV-vis spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography, and find that the smallest conazole, fluconazole, binds with an order of magnitude higher affinity than the natural substrate. The authors conclude that the lipophilic properties of the conazoles and their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier may make them good candidates for treating Naegleria fowleri infections in humans, and suggest that assessing their brain penetration in an animal model may identify the most effective drug. They also determine the crystal structure of the NfCYP1-conazole complex, which provides a basis for further optimization of the drugs.
The paper describes a pilot control program for cystic hydatid disease (CHD) in two rural counties in Xinjiang, China. The program aimed to prevent the release of Echinocococcus granulosis eggs from dogs into the environment by treating all dogs with praziquantel (PZQ) every month. This strategy was found to be effective in reducing the prevalence of E. granulos in dogs and newborn CHD in sheep, and was considered a practical and cost-effective measure for controlling the disease in hyperendemic areas. The program involved training village hydatid disease control officers (VHDCOs) to treat dogs monthly and monitor the progress. Dog culling was also carried out to reduce the number of intermediate hosts. While there were some challenges in implementing the program, the results showed that the strategy of treating dogs before adult tapeworms matured could significantly reduce transmission of E. granulos and lower the prevalence of CHD. The program was successful in both Han Chinese and Uygur Muslim communities in the two counties. The use of baited PZQ tablets was found to improve compliance and the program was considered a promising approach for controlling CHD in rural areas.
The paper found that babies born with low birth weight for their gestational age, defined as either less than the 3rd percentile or less than the 10th percentile, are at increased risk of death from all causes during childhood, including infection, injury, cancer, and neurological disease. The risk is highest in the first year of life but remains elevated up to age 10 years. The association is strongest for severe fetal growth restriction, which is defined as less than the 3rd percentile. The study found that the risk of death from infection is particularly high in children born with severe fetal restriction. While the absolute risk is low, the authors suggest that early interventions and careful monitoring during pregnancy and after birth may be able to reduce the risk of death from infection and other causes. The findings highlight the importance of active follow-up of children born with fetal growth restriction and suggest that smoking cessation and nutritional support during pregnancy may be effective strategies to reduce the risk of death.
The paper describes a theoretical framework for efficiently simulating protein-peptide interactions by sampling peptide sequences and protein conformations in a single run. The method, called the multisequence Monte Carlo approach, uses simulations to generate representative peptide sequences that are biased according to the binding free energies of different sequences. This allows for efficient calculation of binding free energies for a large number of peptides, while still capturing the details of peptide conformational dynamics. The approach is tested on 3 different protein-peptide domains with different binding specificities, and shows good agreement with experimental data. The results suggest that the method can provide insights into the binding specificity of peptides and how conformational flexibility impacts binding, while also potentially being used to identify new peptide binding sites on protein structures. The method's ability to sample both protein conformations and sequences in a single run makes it computationally efficient and useful for understanding protein-peptide interactions.
The paper discusses the impact of a Chagas disease vector control program in Cochamba, Bolivia on the prevalence of infestation by the vector triatomine bugs Trypanosoma infestans in homes. The program involved spraying insecticides in homes at-risk areas. The program initially achieved significant reductions in infestation rates, but infestation rates did not continue to decline after 2004, showing residual infestation was still common. The authors found that ecological factors such as the proportion of land covered by montane dry forests and the socioeconomic development index of municipalities impacted infestation rates. The program likely averted around 15000-430 new Chagas disease infections per year, but residual infestation in 3% of homes indicates that around 230-35 new infections occur annually. The program likely had a major impact on reducing pediatric infections, but the actual incidence may be higher due to underreporting. The paper highlights the need for long-term entomological surveillance to monitor residual infestation and improve vector control efforts. The authors conclude that insecticide-based vector control remains an important tool for preventing Chagas disease, but residual infestation requires sustained efforts to eliminate.
The paper describes a new approach for analyzing ChIP-seq data in bacteria to better understand transcription factor binding. The authors propose a biophysically motivated model that represents the binding process as a Boltzmann distribution with two parameters: genome accessibility and binding affinity. They show that genome accessibility explains more of the variability in ChIP-seq data than affinity alone and can be used to predict peak binding sites. They demonstrate this by analyzing a large dataset of ChIP-seq experiments for 64 transcription factors in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and show that genome accessibility is associated with various genomic features such as intergenic regions and gene expression levels. The approach has the potential to predict binding affinity and genome accessibility for new transcription factors and experimental conditions, which could help researchers study gene regulation in bacteria in a more efficient and comprehensive way.
The paper discusses how fish species have different ways of developing their pelvic muscles. Some species, like sharks and ray-finned fish, develop their pelvic muscles through direct epithelial extension from the body wall, while others, like bony fish, develop them through a process called "myotomal extension" where myoblasts migrate from the somites to the pelvic fin. The authors studied pelvic muscle development in various fish species and found that all bony fish species studied developed their pelvic muscles through myotomal extension, not through epithelial extension. They also showed that this developmental mechanism is intermediate between the primitive and derived mechanisms seen in chondrichthyans and tetrapods, and allows for greater flexibility in pelvic limb positioning without compromising body wall muscle formation. The authors propose that the ability to develop pelvic muscles independently of epithelial extension may have facilitated the transition to terrestrial locomotion in tetrapods.
The paper discusses a multi-scale simulation approach to model the insertion of iPLA2, a phospholipase A2 enzyme, into a phospholipid bilayer. The authors used coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CG) simulations to build an initial model of the enzyme at the membrane surface and then refined the model with all-atom molecular dynamics (AA) simulations. They found that the enzyme adopts a well-defined orientation at the membrane surface that is aimed to facilitate the extraction of phospholipids from the membrane. The insertion depth and orientation of the enzyme on the lipid surface are finely tuned to facilitate rapid turnover. The enzyme was observed to diffuse laterally at the membrane surface without disrupting the membrane complex. The results suggest that the flexible loops that form the entrance to the active site cavity regulate the accessibility of the active site. The study provides a computational model of the iPLA2-membrane complex that can be used to guide the design of inhibitors of the enzyme. The approach could also be used to study the impact of lipid diversity and sequence mutations on the activity of iPLA2 and related enzymes.
The paper discusses the potential role of apoptosis as an innate immune response against viral infection in insects. The authors found that infection with certain viruses in insects can cause rapid induction of genes that promote apoptosis, leading to the rapid elimination of infected cells and limiting the spread of the virus. This rapid induction of apoptosis is found to be specific to certain types of cells and requires a regulatory region in the genome called the IRER. The authors show that the P53 protein is involved in mediating the rapid induction of these pro-apoptotic genes in Drosophila, and that the rapid induction of apoptosis is capable of blocking viral infection at early stages. They demonstrate this by showing that lacking the ability to rapidly induce apoptosis leads to increased susceptibility to infection. They propose that the rapid induction of apoptosis may act as an innate immune response to limit infection at the initiation stage, before viral genes have a chance to take control of the cellular system. The results suggest that mechanisms controlling the rapid induction of apoptosis may be specific to certain cell types and may be lost in cultured cells, potentially explaining why cultured cells do not exhibit this response. The study highlights the potential importance of apoptosis as an immune response in insects, which may help limit the spread of viruses through vectors like mosquitoes.
The paper describes an investigation into the roles of two enzymes, RAD52 and POLQ, in repairing DNA double strand breaks. The authors used a variety of techniques to examine how disrupting these enzymes affects DNA repair and replication fork velocity. They found that RAD52 is important for repairing DNA breaks that are longer than 50 nucleotides and require removing non-homologous DNA sequences, while POLQ is important for repairing shorter DNA breaks that require annealing of microhomology. Disrupting both enzymes causes a decrease in replication fork velocity and failure to protect stalled replication forks from degradation. The results suggest that RAD52 and POLQ have distinct functions in DNA repair, and that disrupting both enzymes may be an effective approach for genotoxin sensitization and synthetic lethality.
This paper explores the role of a protein called "pelo" in the transmission of dengue fever virus (DENV) and how it is affected by the bacterial endosymbiont Wolbachia. The authors found that Wolbachia suppresses the expression of the pelo protein in female mosquitoes, which may contribute to the inhibition of DENV replication. They also found that the miRNA ae-miR-2940-5 is involved in regulating the expression of the pelo gene. The paper suggests that the increase in the levels of the pelo protein in DENV-infected cells may be due to the virus relocalizing the protein to the nucleus, which is required for rapid translation of specific viral proteins. The results provide new insights into how Wolbachia infection restricts DENV transmission in mosquitoes, which could be a key component of a new strategy against arboviral diseases.
The paper describes how the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans can recognize and defend itself against the fungal pathogen Candida albicans. The researchers developed a new assay to study how C. elegans responds to C. albicans in a controlled, in vitro setting. They found that C. elegans responds to C. albicans in a distinct way compared to bacteria, with the immune system primarily detecting surface-associated molecules and virulence factors. They identified a number of genes that are upregulated in response to C. albicans infection, including antifungal peptides, chitinases, and transcription factors. Some of these genes were also downregulated in response to bacteria. The researchers found that the nematode downregulates antibacterial genes in response to C. albicans, which they propose is an adaptive response to allow the worm to focus on producing antifungal defenses. The study suggests that C. elegans integrates signals from C. albicans and factors associated with its virulence to mount a targeted defense response. The results may have clinical implications for identifying novel antimicrobial therapies.
The paper describes a study that aimed to investigate Zika virus transmission in households in Managua, Nicaragua during the 2016 epidemic. The study found that a majority of households (60%) had at least 50% of members infected with Zika virus, indicating widespread transmission. The study also found that 62% of the infected members were asymptomatic, contributing to silent transmission. Zika virus was detected in all bodily fluids, with the longest duration of detection in urine, consistent with previous studies. Detecting Zika virus in saliva over a similar time period and concentration as serum/plasma suggests that saliva could potentially serve as a more accessible diagnostic sample. The study estimated an asymptomatic infection rate of 62%, consistent with previous studies. The findings inform public health decisions about Zika interventions, diagnostic methods and strategies, and vector control activities.
This paper discusses how certain transcription factors can endow cells with the ability to differentiate into different cell types through gene expression, and how this process is related to disease. The authors found that a transcription factor called FoxA2 can bind to silent genes in differentiated tissues, endowing them with the potential to be activated in response to developmental signals. They identified a silent gene called Cdx2 in the liver that is activated during esophageal metaplasia, leading to the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma. They found that a repressor protein called Rfx1 binds to the FoxA2-bound site near Cdx2 and represses its activity. The loss of Rfx1 expression during esophageal metaplasia may be a useful marker of cancer progression, as it is lost in most Barrett's esophagus samples with dysplasia and in esophageal adenocarcinoma. The study suggests that FoxA2 occupancy of silent genes and the presence of repressive factors like Rfx1 can reveal regulatory networks that contribute to disease. The findings provide insight into how certain genetic transitions, like the activation of silent genes, may contribute to human diseases like esophageal adenocarcinoma.
The paper investigates the role of phosphorylation in regulating the function of a protein called BGLF3 in the transcription of late genes during the lytic phase of the herpesvirus life cycle. BGLF3 is found to be phosphorylated at threonine 42 during the lytic phase of in vivo, and this phosphorylation is crucial for the protein to function as a core component of a pre-initiation complex (vPIC) that regulates the transcription of late genes. The paper finds that lack of phosphorylation at threonine 42 leads to a defect in the expression of late structural proteins and the inability of the virus to produce new viral particles. Phosphorylation of BGL3 at threonine 42 is also found to form a trimeric complex with two other late gene regulators, BFRF2 and BVLF1, which is essential for transcription of late genes. The paper concludes that phosphorylation plays a key role in regulating the function of vPIC in transcription of late genes, identifying additional post-translational modifications that are indispensable for expression of late genes, and potentially informing the development of drugs against EBV infections.
The paper evaluates the potential impact of different dietary policies to increase fruit and vegetable consumption and reduce sugar-sweetened beverage consumption on cardiovascular disease mortality and socioeconomic disparities in the US. The authors use a simulation model to estimate the effects of four policies: a national media campaign, a 10% increase in sugar-sweetened beverage price, a 10% reduction in fruit and vegetable price, and a 30% fruit and vegetable subsidy for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) participants. They find that a targeted subsidy for SNAP participants, especially a 30% subsidy, would be the most effective in reducing cardiovascular disease mortality and socioeconomic disparities, particularly among SNAP participants. The 10% fruit and vegetable subsidy would reduce cardiovascular mortality by 9.5% and 10000 deaths, while the national media campaign would reduce it by 0.7%. The combined policy of targeted subsidies and taxes would be the most effective, reducing cardiovascular mortality by 6.1% and 12800 deaths. The paper suggests that targeted pricing strategies within SNAP could be particularly effective at improving dietary quality and reducing cardiovascular mortality and socioeconomic disparities.
The paper explores how people in a rural Ethiopian community affected by podoconis (a, a neglected tropical disease) view and use footwear in relation to preventing the disease. Despite a desire to wear shoes, many practical and social barriers prevent consistent shoe use, including financial constraints, poorly designed shoes for certain activities, low perceived risk, and stigma. While patients who received treatment for podoconis were more likely to consistently wear shoes, the wider community had more limited shoe use. Children were encouraged to wear shoes to school but were often discouraged from wearing them for housework and play. The paper highlights the importance of addressing these barriers to develop effective interventions that promote consistent shoe use and take into account the specific needs of each neglected tropical disease. It suggests that custom-made shoes may not increase stigma and that more nuanced questions need to be asked of participants to capture the full range of shoe-wearing behaviors.
The paper studies the spatial and temporal patterns of rabies in striped skunks in the North Central United States using passive surveillance data from a diagnostic laboratory. It found that striped skunks in developed, low intensity areas and highly fragmented landscapes, which are often peri-urban environments, have a higher risk of transmitting rabies to humans and domestic animals. The study identified that diurnal temperature range, which is decreasing due to climate change, is a significant driver of rabies in striped skunks. It suggests that human mediated landscape changes and climate-change may exacerbate the prevalence of rabies in this species and that further studies are needed to better understand the dynamics of the disease in this region and prevent transmission to humans and other animals.
This paper investigated how parental origin affects the susceptibility to a rat model of multiple sclerosis called myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (MOG-EAE). The researchers found that 37-54% of genes that affect susceptibility to this disease have a parental origin effect, meaning they are more likely to be expressed from one parent than the other. They identified 16 genes that have a parental origin effect on susceptibility, including one gene called Dlk1. Dlk1 is involved in signaling pathways and is expressed from the maternal copy in the rat genome. Lower Dlk1 expression in spleen of rats predisposes them to more severe EAE, while higher Dlk1 expression protects against EAE. The researchers found that Dlk1 expression levels were lower in rats that inherited the risk allele from their fathers compared to rats that inherited it from their mothers. They also showed that Dlk1 transgenic mice that express higher levels of Dlk1 have less severe EAE and produce fewer Th1 cells compared to wildtype mice. They suggest that Dlk1 may play a role in regulating the adaptive immune response and susceptibility to EAE by controlling Notch signaling.
The paper describes how bacteria use a type VI secretion system (T6SS) to deliver toxic proteins to other bacteria in order to compete with them. The T6SS has two main parts: the basal complex and the sheath. The basal complex is the cytoplasmic part that contains the effectors and the sheath is the outer part that delivers the effectors. The T6SS is regulated by two post-translational mechanisms: the TagF protein and the TPP pathway. The TagF protein inhibits the basal complex from forming, while the TPP pathway activates the PPKA kinase that phosphorylates the Fha protein to form the basal complex. The authors found that the TPP pathway and TagF interact with the basal complex in a way that allows the T6SS to move and reassemble in a new location after each firing, which is important for efficient anti-bacterial activity. They identified a new protein called RtkS that positively regulates the TPP pathway and allows it to activate PPKA. This allows the T6SS to assemble and fire more efficiently. They also found that the TagF protein prevents the basal complex from forming and that Fha is required for sheath assembly, but not for T6SS activity.
The paper describes an approach for inferring the rules of interaction between individuals in a collective motion system using data from both the individual-level behavior and the collective behavior of the system. The authors observe the movements of individual glass prawns in an annular arena and use a hidden Markov model to infer the most likely orientation of each prawn at each time step. They then use Bayesian model selection to compare the marginal likelihood of each model, which is the probability of the data given the model, to the model parameters, to identify the best model that can reproduce both the fine-scale and collective behavior of the prawns. They find that a non-Markovian model that includes a delayed response and a spatial interaction zone is the best at both scales, allowing the prawns to take time to react to past interactions and maintain local interactions. This approach demonstrates a rigorous methodology for selecting a consistent and multi-scale model for collective behavior in animal systems.
The study found that the spatial distribution of place cells in the hippocampus reflects the degree of navigation to a preferred location. The place cells do not simply encode the spatial geometry of the environment, but also encode the location of the reward. When rats were trained to navigate towards a specific reward location in a maze, the place cells expressed a higher degree of accumulation in the section of the maze associated with the reward. This spatial distribution of place cells was found to be biased towards the preferred location. The firing rate of individual place cells contributed to a measure called the spatial vector of place fields, which also reflected the degree of navigation. Optogenetic manipulation of dopaminergic inputs in the hippocampus was found to cause changes in the spatial distribution of place fields, which reflected the direction of the reward location. The study shows that the spatial configuration of place cells encodes the reward location, not just the spatial geometry of the environment.
The paper discusses how the gamma herpesvirus 68 (γV68) virus evades host immune responses by exploiting the innate immune signaling pathway MAVS (Myeloid Differentiation-Activated Protein 2-dependent Signaling) to prevent cytokine production. γV68 infection activates the MAVS-IKβ signaling pathway, which phosphorylates and degrades the transcription factor RelA, thereby terminating NFκB activation and cytokine gene transcription. The RelA degradation occurs in an MAVS- and IKβ-dependent manner, but not through IκBα phosphorylation and degradation. γV68 infection initially activates the MAVS-IKβ pathway in early stages of in infected cells, before the activation of NFκB and cytokine production. This allows the virus to prevent cytokine production and establish a latent infection. The authors propose that γV68 has evolved a "one stone, two birds" strategy by coupling viral transcriptional activation and cellular NFκB termination through the MAVS-IKβ pathway to enable viral replication while disabling host cytokine production. The results suggest that RelA degradation is a critical mechanism for γV68 to evade host immune responses.
The paper describes the discovery of a protein called HORMAD1, which is essential for meiosis in mice. HORMAD1 is a protein that localizes to the axial elements of the synaptonemal complex in germ cells and plays a role in chromosome synapsis and recombination. The researchers found that mice lacking HORMAD1 are infertile due to a meiotic arrest at the pachytene stage of meiosis, specifically a failure to complete homologous chromosome pairing. The protein is also involved in early recombination events and transcriptional silencing of sex chromosomes. HORMAD1 localizes to the axial elements, but is not required for the localization of other synaptonemal complex proteins. The researchers propose that HORMAD1 may be involved in recruiting proteins that are important for synaptonemal complex formation and recombination, such as BRCA1 and γH2AX. The results suggest that HORMAD1 is a key component of the meiotic synaptonemal complex that plays a role in early recombination and transcriptional silencing.
This paper discusses how public health agencies can use social networks to detect emerging outbreaks and situational awareness. The paper finds that surveillance systems that target the most connected individuals in a network tend to provide the earliest and most accurate information, but this comes with uncertainty regarding the underlying transmission rate (R0) of the disease. Surveillance systems that target random acquaintances of random individuals tend to provide more representative and robust information, but their early warning and accuracy are more sensitive to R0. The optimal strategy for early detection of emerging outbreaks is to target individuals with the highest eigenvector centrality, which considers the connectivity of a node's neighbors and their neighbors' neighbors, but this requires full knowledge of the network. Even with this knowledge, the timing of the early warning depends on R0. The paper suggests that identifying individuals with the highest eigenvector centrality is difficult in real-world populations where the network structure is unknown. However, methods that bias random walks towards high centrality nodes can be used to find these individuals. The paper concludes that volunteer-based surveillance systems like FluNearYou can improve coverage by recruiting friends of existing members and that network analysis can help anticipate individual-level epidemiological risk to improve surveillance systems.
The paper discusses a new approach for determining how different negative feedback processes contribute to rhythmic activity in biological systems. The authors consider a simple example of a neural network with two feedback processes, synaptic depression and cellular adaptation, and develop a computational model to quantify their relative contributions. They show that while both processes contribute to episode termination, only the subtractive process, which is a multiplicative factor to the system's activity, contributes significantly to episode initiation. The approach uses perturbations to the feedback processes' time constants to measure their relative contributions, minimizing the impact on the system. The method can be applied to many oscillatory systems that rely on the interplay of positive and negative feedbacks, but experimental implementation is difficult as current techniques cannot change the time constants of feedback processes in a controlled way.
The paper describes a molecular dynamics simulation study of how parallel-stranded guanine-quadruplexes form dimers through stacking of their terminal guanine runs. The simulation found that the 5-5 stacking mode is the most stable, with the stacking interaction between the 5' terminal guanine runs providing the maximum stacking overlap and favorable electrostatic interaction between the monomers. The 3-5 and 3-3 stacking modes are less stable due to weaker stacking and electrostatic repulsion between the monomers. The simulations also showed that counterions at the stacking interface help stabilize the 5-5 dimer, while the 3-5 dimer is stabilized by aromatic ligands that increase the distance between interphosphate contacts. The study provides a molecular-level explanation for the observed preference for the 5-5 stacking mode in experiments and suggests ways to shift the dimerization equilibrium by controlling electrostatic repulsion and interphosphate interactions. The results provide a molecular design strategy for engineering G4-quadruplex structures with desired properties.
The paper investigates how the brain processes and represents the information content of auditory stimuli. The authors use entropy, a measure of information theory, to quantify the amount of predictability or randomness in acoustic signals. They find that the brain's auditory cortex, specifically the primary auditory cortex (PTA), demands more computational resources to process signals with high entropy, meaning they are more predictable, compared to signals with low entropy, meaning they have less predictability. This effect is observed in both behavioral and fMRI data. The authors propose that this difference in neural resource use reflects an efficient encoding mechanism in PTA, which compresses the neural code and reduces the computational demands compared to the retrieval and comparison of symbolic representations. The results suggest that PTA acts as a computational hub for encoding auditory information, while other brain regions like Heschl's gyrus (HG) are more involved in retrieval and comparison. The findings demonstrate the first explicit demonstration of a relationship between the information content of auditory stimuli and the neural activity in the brain.
The paper describes a new framework for performing genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that can identify weak associations that are invisible to standard single marker tests. The framework is called PUMA (Penalized Unified Multiple-locus Association) analysis. It uses a combination of statistical methods and algorithms to simultaneously analyze thousands to millions of genetic markers, while incorporating unpenalized covariates. The methods include penalized regression methods that can identify genetic markers with small effects, while preserving a conservative false discovery rate. The framework includes a new algorithm for finding the optimal penalized maximum likelihood estimates of regression coefficients, data-adaptive tuning of penalties and model selection, and heuristics for ranking the markers based on their significance. The paper shows that the PUMA framework can identify additional genetic associations beyond what is detectable by standard single marker tests, even for large GWAS datasets. It demonstrates its power by applying the framework to simulated and real GWAS datasets and identifying novel associations that were not found by standard methods. The authors conclude that the PUMA framework has the potential to add significant value to GWAS studies by discovering additional disease susceptibility genes that are too weak to be detected by standard methods.
This paper describes the discovery of a new mosquito protein called SPCLIP1 that helps activate the mosquito's complement system in response to infection. The mosquito complement system is similar to the human immune system but has different mechanisms for activating complement proteins. SPCLIP1 is a non-catalytic serine protease that helps activate a complement protein called TEP1, which in turn helps kill bacteria and malaria parasites. SPCLIP1 localizes to the surface of bacteria and helps TEP1 accumulate on the surface, triggering the complement cascade. The authors found that SPCLIP1 is required for the activation of a key enzyme that helps kill malaria parasites. They also found that SPCLIP1 is the first protein to interact with TEP1 and recruit it to the surface of bacteria. They propose that SPCLIP1 and TEP1 interact first in the hemolymph before SPCLIP1 helps TEP1 accumulate on the surface of bacteria, though this interaction could be indirect through another factor. The results suggest that the mosquito complement system is a distinct but functional complementary system that helps kill pathogens.
The paper describes a new method called OptMDFpathway that can identify pathways in a genome-scale metabolic network that allow for carbon fixation with a desired yield of carbon assimilation. The method uses a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) optimization problem to find pathways with maximum thermodynamic driving force (MDF) values, which indicate the feasibility of the pathway. The MDF values are calculated for all possible elementary modes (EMs) of the pathways and the optimal EM with the highest MDF value is identified. The authors applied the method to identify pathways in E. coli that allow for carbon fixation with glucose or glycerol as substrates. They found that 40% of the substrate-product combinations with stoichiometric carbon assimilation could be thermodynamically feasible, and 15% of the pathways with the highest MDF values could be identified. The identified pathways allow for the synthesis of several products with high carbon assimilation yields, including oxaloacetate, carbamoyl phosphate, and succinate. The authors conclude that their method can be used to identify pathways with desired properties and driving forces in large-scale networks, and may enable more efficient biotechnological applications.
The paper describes the crystal structure of the CFA/I pilus chaperone protein CfaA from Escherichia coli. The structure of CfaA adopts a boomerang shape and has two lobes, with the N-terminal domain and C-terminal domain interacting through a hydrophobic interface. The N-terminal domain is longer than the C-terminal domain. The paper shows that CfaA has unique features that distinguish it from other chaperone families, including a long subunit-interacting loop, a D1' insertion in the N-terminal lobe, and a C2-D2' insertion in the C-terminal lobe. Mutations of specific residues in the CfaA structure affected its ability to bind and stabilize the major pilin subunit CfaB, suggesting that these features are important for CfaA function. The study argues that CfaA and related chaperones should be classified as a distinct family called FGA (F1-G1 Alternate) chaperones, which are different from the FGL and FGS chaperones. The study also shows that CfaA recognizes both the minor and major pilin subunits CfaE and CfaB. However, the mechanism by which CfaA recognizes and interacts with these subunits is still unclear and requires further investigation.
The paper discusses the role of a gene called scribble in controlling cell polarity and tissue organization in the mammary gland during mammary development. The researchers created a conditional mouse model where scrible was deleted in the mammary gland to study how this loss of polarity leads to tumorigenesis. They found that loss of scrible leads to premalignant lesions, such as multilayered mammary ducts and hyperplasia, by disrupting the basal-to-luminal transition, altering cell division, and activating the ras/MAPK pathway. They showed that the ras/MAPK pathway is necessary for the accumulation of aberrant luminal cells, but not the initial stages of duct maturation. The results suggest that loss of cell polarity control and deregulation of ras/MAPK signaling are important mechanisms that contribute to mammary tumorigenesis. The mouse model will be useful for studying the role of scrible in tumor progression in vivo and how loss of tissue organization and cell polarity may promote tumorigenesis.
The paper describes the transcriptome of Rhodnius neglectus, a species of blood-sucking insect that feeds on birds and less frequently on opossums. The researchers used next-generation sequencing to identify and analyze the RNA transcripts in the salivary glands of  of nymphs and adults at different stages of feeding. They found many transcripts that are likely secreted proteins, including lipocalins, nitrophorins, serine proteases and odorant-binding proteins. The most abundant group was lipocalins, which are extracellular proteins that bind to small molecules. They also found several putative serine proteases, which could inhibit the coagulation cascade in the host's blood, similar to those found in other hematophagous insects. The proteins were compared to those of another related species, Rhodnius prolixus, and the results suggest that the two species share some similarities but also have some differences. The high similarity in housekeeping proteins suggests that the antihaemostatic proteins evolve faster after divergence, allowing for more diversity among species. The study expands our knowledge of the salivary proteins of hematophagous triatomine bugs and their potential role in blood-feeding and transmission of Chagas disease.
The paper describes a study on how exposure to a parasitic worm called Trichuris suis may help treat inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in juvenile rhesus macaques. The researchers found that infection with T. suis led to a TH2-type immune response in the intestinal mucosa of IBD patients, which was associated with symptomatic improvement. This was seen in five of five IBD patients who were treated with T. suis, but not in a non-responder patient who did not improve. The treatment led to an expansion of certain bacteria in the intestinal mucosa, which may help reduce bacterial attachment and promote mucosal healing. The study suggests that T. suis may be a useful preclinical model for developing new IBD therapies, as the mucosal responses activated by the parasite are similar to those seen in human IBD patients. However, the results highlight the need for more research to fully understand the mechanisms behind the treatment and determine if it is safe and effective in humans.
This paper investigated the prevalence of Strongyloides stercoralis infection, a neglected tropical soil-transmitted helminth, in rural communities in Preah Vihear province, northern Cambodia. The researchers used two diagnostic techniques on two stool samples from each participant to detect Strongyloides stercoralis larvae. They found that 4.7% of participants were infected, which is much higher than previously reported in Cambodia and other countries. Children under six years old were most at risk of infection, and infections steadily increased with age. They found that personal hygiene practices, such as not using a toilet, were a significant predictor of Strongyloides stercoralis infection. They also found that risk of infection was associated with lower rainfall and soil organic carbon content, which suggests that human activities like agriculture may increase the risk. They found that 39% of Strongyloides stercoralis infections could be prevented by proper toilet use. They conclude that Strongyloides stercoralis infection is highly prevalent in rural Cambodian communities and that personal hygiene practices can help prevent infections, but more research is needed to better understand the transmission dynamics and improve treatment access.
This paper proposes a molecular dynamics simulation model for the structure and assembly of asymmetric amyloid fibrils, which are associated with Alzheimer's disease. The authors use a cross-β subunit building block consisting of β-strands and loops as the basic unit to model the fibrils. They show that the asymmetric fibrils have 3 cross-β subunits arranged in a 3-layer structure with two hydrophobic and one polar surface, unlike the symmetric 2-layer 2-cross-β subunit fibrils. The simulation results suggest that the 3-layer structure is more stable than the 2-layer structure, which explains why the asymmetric fibrils are more toxic. The model also explains how external perturbations like mechanical shaking and oxidation of the fibrils can affect their assembly and toxicity. The authors propose that ambiphilic ligands that bind both the hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces of the fibrils could be used as a potential therapeutic for amyloidoses.
The paper discusses the role of the protein caspase-1 in Burkholderia pseudomallei infection, a bacterium that causes melioidosis, a disease endemic to Southeast Asia and other tropical regions. The authors found that caspase-1 is required for the protection of mice against this infection. They showed that caspase-1 is activated in macrophages and epithelial cells infected with the bacteria, which leads to the production of the cytokines IL-18 and TNF-alpha, which in turn trigger the inflammasome and induce the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The bacteria are restricted in cells that lack caspase-1. They also found that the production of ROS through NADPH oxidase is the main mechanism by which IFNgamma protects against Burkholderia infection. The study identified two mechanisms activated by the non-canonical and canonical inflammasomes that confer protection in melioidosis: caspase-1-dependent activation of the IL-18-IFN-gamma-ROS axis in myeloid cells and caspase-1-dependent pyroptosis of infected epithelial cells. The results suggest that caspase-1 dependent pyroptosis of infected epithelial cells may be the main protective mechanism triggered by the non-canonical inflammasome in melioidosis.
The paper discusses a randomized controlled trial in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania that tested whether an HIV treatment model where lay health workers deliver antiretroviral drugs to patients' homes instead of nurses and physicians at healthcare facilities resulted in similar or better treatment outcomes compared to standard facility-based care. The study found that the lay health worker model performed at least as well as standard care in preventing HIV viral failure among patients who were clinically stable on antiretroviral therapy, and patients reported high satisfaction with receiving ARVs at home. However, the model only allowed a small proportion of patients to receive ARVs at home, and the study found that a larger proportion of patients who were lost to follow-up were failing virologically. The study concludes that while the model shows promise, scaling it up to serve a larger proportion of patients would likely require modifications to the eligibility criteria, the number of healthcare facilities involved, and the ability to deliver ARVs to patients outside of their home catchment areas. The study also found that patient healthcare expenditures were not significantly reduced, but patients reported saving time and money by receiving ARVs at home. The model holds potential as an alternative to standard care in resource-poor settings where human and physical resources for treatment are scarce, but additional research is needed to address issues that arise at larger scales and over longer time periods.
The paper discusses how the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans can survive long periods of food deprivation by coordinating its cellular processes to conserve energy during times of scarcity. The researchers found that a specific type of neuron called sensory neurons called ciliated sensory neurons are responsible for detecting changes in food availability and signaling this information to the rest of the organism through the release of molecules in dense-core vesicles. The molecules contain insulin-like peptides that regulate a transcription factor called DAF-16/FOXO, which in turn controls cellular processes such as growth and reproduction. The researchers identified a specific gene called unc-3 that is involved in this mechanism and found that mutations in this gene extend the worms' ability to survive without food. They also found that a specific channel called OCR-2 in the sensory neurons is also involved in this mechanism, specifically in the release of dense-core vesicles containing insulin-like peptides. The researchers propose that sensory neurons detect changes in food availability and signal this information to the rest of the organism through the release of these dense-core vesicles, which then activate the DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor, allowing the worms to survive without food.
The paper describes the identification and characterization of a new antiviral factor, Toll4, from the shrimp species L. vannamei, which is involved in recognizing and responding to the viral pathogen White Spotted Syndrome Virus (WSSV). Toll4 is found to induce a specific set of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) upon WSSV infection, which are thought to play a role in limiting viral replication. The authors identify a Toll4-Dorsal pathway that mediates the antiviral response by detecting WSSV infection and inducing the expression of specific AMPs, including lysozyme and antimicrobial peptides. The Toll4-Dorsal pathway is found to be specific to WSSV infection and not other pathogens tested, suggesting that Toll4 may be a key factor in recognizing and responding to WSSV. The paper proposes a model where Toll4 recognizes WSSV infection, triggers the activation of Dorsal, which in turn induces the expression of specific AMPs. The results suggest that the Toll4-Dorsal pathway may provide a new antiviral mechanism for controlling WSSV infection in shrimp. The study provides insights into the antiviral immune system of shrimps and may provide strategies for limiting WSSV infection in shrimp aquaculture.
This paper explores the function of the Rrm3 protein in DNA replication. The authors find that the protein has two distinct functions: 1) an ATPase/helicase activity that helps move replication forks through protein-DNA complexes and 2) a disordered N-terminal tail that restricts DNA synthesis in the presence of replication stress and helps Rrm3 associate with origins of replication. The ATPase/helicase activity is not required for the second function, but the disruption of the N-terminal tail causes the mutation of the second function. The second function is not dependent on the ATPase/helicase activity. This second function appears to be specific to origins of replication that are late-initiating and near telomeres, and not early-initiating origins. The authors identify Rad5, Rdh54, and Rph1 as proteins that help maintain genome stability in the absence of the N-terminal tail function of Rrm3. The accumulation of GCRs and mutations in the ATPase/helicase mutant suggests that Rrm3's second function may cause DNA damage. The paper proposes a model where Rrm3 performs two genetically and physically separable functions to deal with challenges during genome duplication: controlling DNA synthesis in the presence of replication stress and controlling DNA replication origins.
The paper investigates whether DNA methylation patterns that change with age can be used to predict the prognosis of cancer patients. The authors analyze DNA methylation data from 25 different types of cancer and find that while DNA methylation patterns in normal tissue do not accurately reflect the chronological age of cancer patients, methylation patterns that become hypermethylated with age are coherently modified across different types of cancer. They identify specific genes that have hypermethylation in both normal tissue and cancer, which suggests that a molecular mechanism is driving these changes. They find that hypermethylation of certain genes is associated with better prognosis in some types of cancer while hypomethylation is associated with poorer prognosis. The results suggest that DNA methylation changes in cancer may contribute to immortalization and malignant transformation. The study demonstrates that DNA methylation patterns in cancer, particularly those that become hypermethylated with age, can provide prognostic markers for cancer subtypes.
The paper describes the discovery of a new mechanism of carbon dioxide sensing in yeast. Researchers found that a transcription factor called Rca1p regulates the expression of an enzyme called carbonic anhydrase in response to low ambient carbon dioxide levels. Carbonic anhydrase is important for yeast growth and metabolism, and is required for the production of a molecule called hydrogen carbonate that is used in various cellular processes. They identified Rca1p as the transcription factor that regulates carbonic anhydrase expression in both Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. They showed that Rca1p induces carbonic anhydrase expression when yeast faces low carbon dioxide levels, but not when it is exposed to high levels. This allows the yeast to produce the necessary hydrogen carbonate molecule to support growth in low carbon dioxide environments. They also found that Rca1p regulates the expression of other genes involved in metabolism in addition to carbonic anhydrase, and that its function is conserved in both species. The discovery of Rca1p provides new insights into how yeast sense and respond to carbon dioxide levels, which is an important signaling molecule in many organisms.
The paper discusses the results of a study on visceral leishmaniasis, a protozoan infection caused by Leishmania chagasi, in Brazil. The study found that patients with visceral leishmaniasis have higher levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in their blood compared to healthy controls, which may contribute to their immune activation and low T cell counts. LPS stimulates macrophages to release pro-inflammatory cytokines and activate T cells, which in turn can lead to cell death. The study suggests that elevated LPS levels may play a role in the immunopathogenesis of visceral leishmaniasis, along with Leishmania antigens, by contributing to the systemic immune activation and inflammatory environment. The findings suggest that antimicrobial prophylaxis in combination with anti-Leishmania therapy may be beneficial for visceral leishmaniasis patients by reducing LPS-mediated immune activation and improving their prognosis. The study provides evidence that LPS is elevated in visceral leishmaniasis and may be a suitable biomarker for assessing the disease.
The paper investigates the difference in mutation rates between Escherichia coli grown aerobically and anaerobically. The study found that E. coli grown aerobically had a higher mutation rate, with 1.15 mutations per genome per generation, while E. coli grown anaerobically had a mutation rate of 1.7 times higher, at 1.90 mutations per genome per generation. The mutation types were analyzed and found to differ between the two environments, with A:T>C transversions being more common in aerobic cells, while G:C>A transversions were more common in anaerobic cells. IS150 insertions were found to be particularly high in anaerobic cells, with 3.1-fold higher insertion rate than in aerobic cells. The study suggests that the difference in mutation rates may be due to differences in cell cycle timing and growth rates between the two environments, with faster growing cells being more vulnerable to mutations during DNA replication. The results provide insight into how the different growth conditions affect genetic variation and evolution in facultative anaerobes.
This paper describes a new approach to identifying genes and networks associated with cancer development and progression using gene expression microarray data. The authors use a weighted network mining algorithm called Quasi-Clique Merger (QCM) to identify frequent co-expression networks from multiple cancer datasets. They find that the networks identified from cancer datasets are more highly enriched for genes involved in cell cycle regulation, genome stability, and DNA repair, while networks from normal tissues are more focused on housekeeping functions like cell metabolism and protein synthesis. The predominant cancer network identified from multiple datasets contains genes involved in cell cycle regulation, genome stability, and DNA repair, which supports the idea that cancer cells have a high level of coordinated transcriptomic activity. The authors also identify potential oncogenes by studying genes that have not been directly linked to these functions in human cells but show evidence of involvement in these processes. The approach is able to identify networks that are not found using differential expression analysis and can provide insights into the underlying biology of cancer. However, the method has some limitations in that it only considers gene expression and does not capture non-expression level interactions, and the results are sensitive to parameter choices. The findings provide new insights into the common characteristics and pathways of cancer development and progression.
The paper describes a new method for designing peptides that specifically bind to bZIP proteins, which are proteins that form coiled coils and dimerize. The authors first used a machine learning algorithm based on experimental data to predict the strength of interactions between different residues in bZIP proteins. They then used this model to design peptides that bind tightly to their intended targets while minimizing interactions with other bZIP proteins. They tested their method on four bZIP proteins and successfully designed peptides that bound to their targets with high affinity and specificity. The authors' approach combined computational predictions from the machine learning model with experimental data to design peptides that could be used to selectively inhibit bZIP dimerization. The method has potential applications for studying protein interactions in general and could be used to design peptides that bind to other proteins with specific properties.
The paper examines how rats make spontaneous choices in a stable, deterministic environment. The rats were trained to choose from four different flavored pellets in an operant chamber with nose poking and lever pressing. The authors found that the rats showed bursty behavior with short and longer inter-choice intervals, which was described by a power-law and Weibull distributions. The bursty nature of their choices was found to be influenced by both the level of satiety (hunger) and the circadian rhythm. They proposed a dual-state model that described the temporal and sequential dynamics of the rats' choices. The model had an active state with bursty activity and an inactive state with a non-homogeneous Poisson process between bursts. The active state was influenced by the satiation-attainment process, while the inactive state was influenced by the circadian rhythm. The model also described the sequential dynamics of choosing the same option over multiple trials, which was found to be driven by a combination of goal-directed and habitual control. The rats' choices were found to maintain a balance between exploration and exploitation, showing that internal factors and previous choices played a role in their decision making. The authors concluded that the dual-state model and dual-control model provided a better fit to the data than single models of goal-directed or habitual control alone.
The paper explores the evolution of thermostability in ribonuclease H proteins along different lineages of bacteria. The researchers found that while the melting temperature (Tm) of these proteins increased along one lineage, the mechanisms by which stability is achieved (ΔHs, ΔCp, and Ts) fluctuated over evolutionary time. This suggests that the evolution of thermostability is not driven by a single selective pressure but rather by multiple mechanisms that are uncoupled from each other. This is consistent with the idea of "thermodynamic systems drift," where a protein's stability is maintained by a threshold, but the mechanisms by which it is achieved vary over time. This allows proteins to efficiently explore sequence space and evolve new functions. The study shows that comparing thermostability between two proteins does not reveal the evolutionary forces that shape the mechanism of stabilization and highlights the importance of studying multiple homologs to identify stabilizing mutations. The findings imply that proposing an adaptive trajectory based on comparisons of modern proteins is misleading and that proteins can efficiently explore sequence space even when maintaining a threshold for stability.
This paper presents a mathematical model to study the role of dendritic cells (pDCs) in protecting mice against cytopathic viruses like mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). The model combines in vitro experiments with mathematical modeling to estimate the parameters of pDC function in infecting mice. The model shows that pDCs in the spleen act as a "sink" that can eliminate a substantial amount of virus, but the spleen can only protect against severe disease if there are enough pDCs present. The number of pDCs needed to protect against severe disease is estimated to be around 200 cells. The model also shows that pDCs in the spleen protect against cytopathic viruses by producing interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) that inhibits virus replication in target cells. The model provides insight into the robustness and fragility of the pDC-mediated protection and suggests that antiviral drugs should target viral spread in non-lymphoid organs. The study demonstrates the power of using a systems biology approach that combines experimental data with mathematical modeling to better understand complex immune processes.
This paper describes the discovery of a genetic locus associated with impaired acrosome reaction in stallions using a genome-wide association study (GWAS). The authors found that a polymorphism in the gene FKBP6 (also known as FK506 binding protein 6) was significantly associated with the impaired acrosome reaction phenotype in stallions. The FKBP6 gene encodes a protein involved in sperm functions, including acrosome reaction and membrane fusion. The polymorphism in the FKBP6 gene was found to affect transcription and protein structure in a way that may negatively impact acrosome reaction. The study suggests that FKBP6 is a susceptibility gene for impaired acrosome reaction in stallions, although its penetrance is incomplete. The findings provide a new candidate gene for unexplained male subfertility in mammals, including humans. The study also demonstrates the utility of using ejaculated sperm DNA and RNA for GWAS and gene expression analysis, and shows that stallion semen can be used as a source of non-invasive samples for fertility genomics research.
The paper proposes a motion detection model based on the visual system of insects that can accurately detect angular velocity across different scenes. The model is based on the known properties of the fly visual system, specifically the LPTC cells. The model consists of a correlation-based EMD, which is sensitive to contrast and spatial structure, and a number of additional non-linear components to account for the limitations of the EMD. The model was tested on high dynamic range images of urban and natural scenes, with different contrast levels, spatial resolution and sampling rates. The results showed that the model could accurately detect angular velocity across different scenes, with the optimal spatial resolution of 2 degrees and 2.8 degree optical blur. The model could be tuned to achieve different angular velocity coding ranges, but at the cost of computational efficiency. The model's robustness against noise was found to be optimal at lower sampling rates, which is consistent with the insect visual system. The model may be suitable for real-time applications on modern computer platforms, though its complexity is currently too high for a single CPU.
The paper discusses the results of a study on the risk factors for tungiasis, a tropical disease caused by the bite of the sand flea Tunga penetrans. The study found that several factors are associated with a higher likelihood of getting tungias in a rural Nigerian community. These include living in a house made of sand or clay, resting outside, having pigs on the compound, and not using closed footwear. The study also found that younger and older people are more likely to get tungias, possibly due to differences in exposure and behavior. The study suggests that cementing floors and confining pigs indoors could significantly reduce the prevalence of tungias. The findings suggest that modifiable factors like housing conditions and animal reservoirs play a large role in the transmission of tungias and that interventions targeting these factors could be effective. The study highlights the importance of an integrated approach that involves both animal reservoirs, housing conditions and health education to reduce the burden of tungias in resource-poor communities.
The paper discusses how the hippocampus forms a neural representation of the local environment using a dual rate and position code. When an animal is moved to a new environment, the place cells in the hippocampus change their firing rates to match the new environment. This is called rate remapping. The authors propose that the hippocampus uses a combination of discrete attractor states (for contextual features) embedded in a continuous spatial attractor manifold to represent the environment. This allows local modifications to the place field representation without affecting other cells that code for distant positions. The authors show through simulations that the gradual population transitions observed during rate remapping are consistent with this model, and that single cell hysteresis can occur even in the absence of synaptic plasticity. They also predict that rate remapping is independent of the dentate gyrus and requires recurrent feedback connections. They suggest that molecular techniques could be used to test this prediction. The findings provide a mechanism for connecting discrete memories with a spatial representation in a way consistent with current theory and neurophysiology. The authors argue that understanding rate remapping could help us understand a wider range of brain areas and brain functions.
The paper describes a study on the effects of the venom from the fer-de-de-snake (Bothrops asper snake) on mouse muscle tissue over time. The venom causes rapid damage, including hemorrhage and necrosis, and the researchers analyzed the proteins present in the fluid that leaks out of the muscle tissue over time. They found that the venom proteins present in the fluid at the early stages of envenoming (1 hour) were mostly intracellular proteins, indicating direct damage to muscle fibers. As time passed, cytoskeletins and mitochondrial proteins decreased, suggesting that these proteins were released from damaged muscle fibers. However, membrane proteins and extracellular matrix proteins remained present in the fluid at higher levels indicating indirect damage. Endogenous proteinases likely generated during the inflammatory response also played a role in releasing these proteins. The study found that extracellular matrix proteins were most abundant in fluid at the early stages, suggesting that venom proteins likely degraded these components. The venom proteins likely caused the rapid microvascular damage that led to hemorrhage, while endogenous proteinases contributed to the degradation of extracellular matrix over time.
The paper summarizes the results of a study evaluating the impact of a national deworming program on soil-transmitted helminthic infections in Uganda. The program, initiated by the Ugandan Ministry of Health in 2003, involves twice-yearly deworming of school-age children and community-directed implementation. The study found that the program has significantly reduced the prevalence of soil-transmitted helminths, especially hookworm infections, in districts that implement mass drug administration for lymphatic filariasis and onchocercias. However, districts that do not have these diseases show an increase in soil-transmitted helminth infections. The program has also improved awareness and knowledge of soil-transmitted helminths among children. However, the study concludes that sanitation issues remain a challenge and must be addressed to ensure sustainable reduction of soil-transmitted helminth morbidity. The program requires a holistic approach that prioritizes operational research and monitoring to ensure proper resource allocation and utilization.
The paper investigates how humans compute confidence in their decisions. The authors propose a hypothesis that confidence is based on the observer's internal representation of the stimulus, called x, which is compared to a set of category and confidence boundaries. They test this hypothesis against a number of alternative models, including Bayesian models that compute the posterior probability of being correct, and heuristic models that approximate Bayesian computation but do not actually compute a posterior distribution. They find that the Bayesian models perform poorly and that subjects use heuristic models that approximate Bayesian computation but do not compute a posterior distribution. They conclude that the neural basis of confidence is likely not based on Bayesian computation, but rather on some unknown objective function that combines task performance and biological constraints. The Bayesian hypothesis does not provide a good fit to the data.
The paper presents a detailed study on recombination rates in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. The researchers generated genotypes of 5860 female flies using whole-genome sequencing and analyzed the genotypes of 139 million SNPs to identify recombination events, including crossing over (CO) and gene conversion (GC) events. They found that there are many different hotspots of high and coldspots of recombination across the genome, with some regions having much higher or lower rates of recombination. The hotspots are often associated with genic regions and transcriptional activity. The researchers also found that CO events are more evenly distributed across chromosomes, while GC events are more uniformly distributed. They identified 18 and 10 motifs associated with CO and GC events. They found that GC events are more frequent than CO events and tend to occur within annotated transcriptional units. The study provides the first high-resolution genome-wide maps of CO and GC rates in D. melanogaster and reveals many different levels of variation in recombination. The results suggest that the difference in recombination rates between CO and GC events across the genome may be due to different repair mechanisms. The study highlights the importance of studying multiple crosses to accurately estimate recombination rates and the potential for selection to act on or be associated with recombination modifiers. The findings provide a new generation of population genetic models of selection that take into account the dynamic, heterogeneous recombination environments across genomes.
The paper discusses how malaria parasites manipulate their hosts by exporting proteins to the red blood cells and liver cells to promote their growth and development. The parasites have families of proteins that are exported into the red blood cells and liver cells, called pir, fam-a and fam-b. These proteins are encoded by genes in the parasite genome but are not involved in the red blood cell surface receptors that mediate sequestration and rosetting. Instead, they are expressed in the blood and liver cells and are involved in different functions such as transport of lipids, nutrients and immune modulation. The expression of these proteins in blood and liver cells suggests that they may be involved in intracellular parasite growth and development rather than red blood cell interactions. The authors analyzed the expression of these proteins in different parasite stages and found that some proteins were expressed in both the blood and liver, suggesting they may be involved in intracellular processes. They also found that some of these proteins have lipid transfer activity, supporting a role in parasite growth. The study expands our understanding of how malaria parasites manipulate their hosts and may inform strategies for controlling malaria infection.
The paper discusses how different subspecies of the bacterium Francisella tularensis, which is a gram-negative, facultative intracellular bacterium and can survive within macrophages, have different levels of virulence. The more virulent subspecies, such as Francisella tularensis subsp. tularensis, can cause tularemia, a severe and potentially fatal disease in humans. The subspecies with lower virulence, Francisella tularensis subsp. novicida and holarctica, have been found to have fewer pseudogenes, or inactive genes, which may contribute to their lower virulence. The authors analyzed the genomes of 20 Francisella tularensis strains and found that the more virulent subspecies, subsp. tularensis, had more IS elements and pseudogenes, indicating genetic decay and rearrangements that may have contributed to their increased virulence. In contrast, the less virulent subspecies, subsp. holarctica and medias, had fewer pseudogenes and showed evidence of genetic diversity and rearrangements, which may have allowed them to become more benign. The findings suggest that genetic diversity within subspecies and the ability to adapt to different environments may have played a role in the evolution of virulence in Francisella.
The paper examines whether the viral load of an infected person can be used to predict the viral load of their sexual partner. The study looked at data from 120 HIV-infected heterosexual couples in Uganda and found that the viral load of one partner was related to the viral load of the other partner, suggesting that the transmitted virus plays a role in determining viral load. However, the study had limitations such as only examining similar subtypes of HIV, lack of host genetic data, and no information on the dose of virus transmitted. The study suggests that viral factors may play a role in determining viral load, but more research is needed to identify these factors and establish their significance. The results imply that the virus can evolve to have a higher virulence through both host and virus-host interactions, which could have implications for HIV transmission and treatment. More studies are needed to further investigate this relationship.
The paper describes a genetic variant in the gene LRP6 that has been found to be associated with early onset and penetrating Crohn's disease in the small intestine. The variant, called Ile1062Val, leads to reduced levels of the LRP6 protein in mucosal tissue from patients with the disease. This reduction in LRP6 is thought to contribute to the low levels of two antimicrobial peptides produced by specialized cells in the small intestine called Paneth cells, which are important for protecting the gut from pathogens. The study found that the Ile1062Val variant is associated with early onset and penetrating Crohn's disease, but not with colonic Crohn's disease. The reduction in LRP6 levels appears to be independent of the TCF7L2 gene, which is also known to be associated with the disease. The study suggests that the reduction in LRP6 may play a direct role in reducing the levels of the antimicrobial peptides produced by Paneth cells, which could contribute to the development of early onset and penetrating Crohn's disease in the small intestine. The findings provide evidence that impaired Paneth cell function may play a primary role in the development of small intestine Crohn's disease, rather than being a secondary effect of other inflammatory changes. The discovery of a genetic marker for early onset and penetrating Crohn's disease could potentially lead to new therapeutic approaches targeting the impaired Paneth cells.
The paper discusses how a plant virus, cowpea mosaic virus (Cowpea mosaic virus), uses a protein called the CP (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase subunit) to invade shoot apices of infected plants. The protein has an N-terminal RNA-rich region that helps binds RNA and is important for viral replication and movement. The researchers found that high levels of the protein inhibit antiviral RNA silencing mechanisms in infected plants, leading to increased virus accumulation and longer recovery periods. They propose a model where the high levels of protein inhibit the 2b protein, which in turn reduces the 2b protein's ability to suppress antiviral RNA silencing. This allows the virus to accumulate more RNA and move from the shoot apices to the newly emerging tissues, leading to longer recovery periods. The research suggests that the CP plays a key role in regulating the interactions between the virus and the plant, enabling the virus to persistently infect the shoot apex.
The paper describes a study on how the personalized drug crizotinib works in treating non-small cell lung cancer. The drug works by inhibiting the activity of a protein called ROS1. The researchers found that a mutation in the ROS1 protein called G203R confers resistance to crizotib by opening up the binding pocket and making it harder for the drug to bind. This resulted in a decrease in the binding affinity and an increase in the residence time of crizotib. The researchers used advanced molecular dynamics simulations to study the binding free energy and conformation of the ROS1-crizotinib complex to explain the mechanism of resistance. They found that the up-moved P-loop region in the G203R mutation makes the binding pocket more open, which reduces the binding affinity and increases the residence time. The simulations showed that the up-moved P-loop region contributes mainly to the crizotib resistance, but also shortens the residence time. The study suggests that besides binding affinity, drug residence time should also be considered for rational drug design to overcome resistance.
The paper describes a new method called LoClass that can identify and categorize bacterial microcompartments (BMCs) based on their genetic sequences. The method uses a novel scoring mechanism that takes into account the presence of various domains associated with different BMC functions, such as pfam domains, to compare and cluster different BMC loci. The authors analyzed over 2000 bacterial genomes and identified 30 different types of BMC loci, including new types that had not been previously described. The results show that BMC loci are found in a wide range of bacterial phyla, with the greatest diversity found in the Firmicutes and Gammaproteobacteria. The study highlights the ability of LoClass to identify novel BMC loci and types that do not fit the traditional carboxysome or metabolosome models, suggesting that BMCs have evolved diverse functions beyond what is currently known. The findings provide a comprehensive taxonomy of BMC loci that can guide the design of BMC modules for synthetic biology applications.
This paper describes a new method to identify functional associations between phosphorylation sites within proteins. The authors found that co-occurrence of phosphorylation sites within proteins or between interacting proteins can indicate functional associations. They analyzed high-throughput phosphorylation data from human and mouse to identify co-occurring pairs of phosphosites that tend to be phosphorylated under the same conditions. They found that co-occurring phosphosites are more likely to share functional annotations, catalyzed by the same kinases, and have higher conservation of phosphorylation sites compared to random pairs. The method showed good performance in identifying known functional associations between phosphorylation sites and could identify new associations between interacting proteins. The authors suggest that co-occurrence of phosphorylation status can be used as a complementary approach to other methods to identify functional associations between different phosphorylation types.
The paper discusses how circadian oscillations, or daily rhythms, are found in a large proportion of genes in mammals, even though the circadian molecular clock is primarily responsible for entrainment of gene expression. The authors propose a new method to analyze microarray data for circadian oscillations by grouping genes into phases based on their expression profiles. Each phase group is then analyzed separately to identify genes that exhibit periodic patterns, which are more robust than analyzing each gene individually. The approach uses digital signal processing techniques to reduce noise and increase statistical power. The authors find that a large proportion of genes, up to 10%, exhibit circadian oscillations, consistent with previous studies in yeast and other organisms. The oscillations are found to be highly tissue-specific, with few genes exhibiting the same phase across different tissues. The oscillations are also found to have different amplitudes across tissues, indicating that the circadian clock is primarily responsible for synchronizing gene expression levels with external factors. The results suggest that oscillations are a natural and important feature of biological pathways, and may be missed in current databases and models.
The paper discusses how some mutations in E. coli can allow cells to grow and divide even though they are deficient in a key enzyme called Hda, which is required for DNA replication initiation. This is called overinitiation. The study found that some mutations that allow overinitiation have changes in the TCA cycle and respiratory chain that limit the amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced. These changes reduce the amount of DnaAATP available for DNA replication initiation, which is thought to be the key factor limiting Hda activity. However, flow cytometry and microarray analysis showed that origin number and origin ratio were not significantly different between mutants and wild type. Instead, the mutants had increased ATP/ADP ratios and cytochrome bd-1 activity, which suggests that other mechanisms beyond a change in ATP/ADP levels may be involved. The study suggests that these mutations reduce oxidative damage to DNA, which allows cells to grow despite overinitiation. Superoxide dismutase sodB was found to be low in some mutants, which could contribute to the oxidative stress. The study proposes that some mutations that allow overinitiation may limit ROS levels to some degree, which helps cells survive despite overinitiation.
The paper describes research on how henipaviruses, which are deadly viruses that cause severe respiratory and neurological illnesses, exploit host factors to infect cells. The researchers found that one particular type of host-encoded RNA molecule called microRNA, called miR-181, helps henipaviruses infect cells by suppressing cellular factors that inhibit the virus. The miR-181 molecule downregulates expression of a type of cellular receptor called Ephrin-B2 and Ephrin-B3, which normally inhibit henipavirus entry and fusion. By reducing these receptors, miR-181 creates an environment that is more conducive to henipavirus infection. The researchers showed that miR-181 is specifically involved in henipavirus infection, promoting cell-cell fusion and viral replication, and is upregulated in the early stages of infection in ferrets and horses. The study suggests that miR-181 is a key factor in henipavirus pathogenesis and may be a potential therapeutic target.
The paper describes an investigation of historical samples from an undifferentiated fever outbreak in Darfur, Sudan in 2015-2016. The study aimed to identify the cause of the outbreak, characterize the outbreak syndrome and inform public health responses. Samples from 65 of the 263 cases that met criteria were tested at a reference laboratory in the UK. Testing found that Crimean Congo Haemoragic Fever (CCHV) was one of the main causes, but not the only cause, of the outbreak. Most cases were from East Darfur where CCHV was endemic. While dengue virus was not detected, CCHV antibodies were found in cattle and camels. The low fatality rate of 20% among CCHV positive cases may be due to delayed diagnosis or sampling later in the disease course. The study highlights the need for improved laboratory capacity to rapidly identify CCHV in Sudan and better data collection and storage of samples to investigate outbreaks. This can help Sudan fulfill its global obligations under the International Health Regulations.
The paper investigated the prevalence of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) infection in people in western Kenya, an area where no outbreaks have been reported in the past. They found that only 0.8% of the community sampled were infected, which is lower than expected based on studies in other areas. They also found that slaughterhouse workers were at a higher risk of infection, with 2.5% of them testing positive. Age was a significant predictor of infection, as older people have likely been exposed to the virus for longer. Slaughtering cattle at the homestead was also found to increase the risk of infection. The authors suggest that slaughterhouse workers may act as sentinels for the virus, highlighting the need for measures to control the movement of infected animals. The ELISA test used had limitations in sensitivity and specificity and some participants may have had cross-reactivity to other bunyaviruses. The study found that RVFV is circulating in western Kenya, and suggests that improved surveillance is needed, particularly during outbreaks to accurately determine the burden of the virus in the area.
The paper discusses the results of a study on the effectiveness of pyrethroid space sprays in controlling the dengue vector mosquito Aedes aegypti in Martinique. The study found that when applied to mosquito populations that have developed resistance to pyrethroids, the sprays were much less effective, resulting in low mortality of less than 10% for pyrethroid-resistant mosquitoes compared to 47-63% mortality for susceptible mosquitoes. This suggests that pyrethroid space sprays are unlikely to reduce the overall density of adult mosquitoes and virus transmission in areas where pyrethroid resistance is already present. The paper argues that this highlights the need to reconsider the use of pyrethroids for controlling adult mosquitoes, especially given that mosquito populations with resistance to pyrethroids are becoming more common. The study also suggests that new formulations of insecticides with different modes of action may be needed to restore the efficacy of pyrethroids against resistant populations. However, the development of new insecticides is expensive and will take time, so in the short term, research should focus on using existing molecules in combination to improve their effectiveness.
The paper investigated how vitamin D status affects the differentiation of macrophages and their ability to mount an antimicrobial response against Mycobacterium leprae. They found that when macrophages are differentiated in sufficient vitamin D levels, they can mount an antimicrobial response against Mycobacterium leprae. Specifically, they found that when macrophages were differentiated in the presence of sufficient vitamin D, they were able to produce a protein called cathelicin which is part of the vitamin D-dependent antimicrobial pathway. This protein helped reduce the viability of Mycobacterium leprae. In contrast, macrophages differentiated in low vitamin D levels did not produce cathelicin and were not able to effectively reduce the viability of Mycobacterium leprae. This suggests that sufficient levels of vitamin D at the site of infection allow recruited monocytes to differentiate into vitamin D-dependent antimicrobial macrophages with the capacity to effectively reduce the viability of intracellular bacteria, which could potentially prevent the establishment and progression of disease. The study suggests that vitamin D supplementation of deficient or insufficient individuals may be beneficial in enhancing the macrophage antimicrobial response and preventing the spread of microbial infections.
The paper describes how the malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei uses a protein called PAT to facilitate its transmission from mosquitoes to humans. The protein is found in specialized life cycle stages of the parasite, including gametocytes and sporozoites. In gametocytes, PAT helps release osmiophilic bodies, which are important for fertilization and transmission. In sporozoites, PAT is required for the secretion of micronemes that allow the parasite to attach to and move around the mosquito's salivary gland and liver. Without PAT, the parasites fail to release these important molecules and are trapped inside the red blood cells, preventing transmission. The researchers used genetic mutants and promoter swapping to demonstrate that PAT is required for the release of these molecules and the resulting transmission failure. They found that while PAT does not directly affect the content of micronemes, it acts as a membrane component that allows the vesicles to fuse with the plasma membrane and release their contents. The research suggests that PAT is an essential component of the parasite's secretory machinery and that targeting it could potentially be used to inhibit transmission.
The paper describes a study on the biological and ecological aspects of the Paracocidioides brasiliensis and Paracidioides lutzii fungi, which cause paracoccidomycosis, a systemic mycosis that affects rural workers in Latin America. The researchers used a combination of techniques to detect the fungus in environmental samples, including a new in situ hybridization technique that visualizes infective structures directly in the samples, and Nested PCR. They found that the fungus was present in soil and aerosol samples from different regions of Brazil, with different species detected in different areas. The results suggest that different environmental conditions may influence the distribution of the different species and that the pathogenicity of each species may be linked to the ability of the fungus to produce infective propagules in the current conditions, which can be influenced by agricultural activities. The study found that Paracidioides lutzii was more commonly detected in soil and aerosol samples in areas where there was deforestation and agriculture, while Paracidioides brasiliensis was detected more frequently in endemic areas. The paper provides new insights into the ecological distribution of these fungi and highlights the importance of studying the ecological and environmental factors that influence their distribution and pathogenicity.
The paper describes a method for simulating the dynamics of neural populations in two dimensions. It uses a grid to represent the state space of each neuron and how probability mass moves between cells. The grid is generated before the simulation starts and the probability mass is updated during each time step using a numerical solution of the advection equation. The grid is fine enough to ensure constant probability mass within cells. The method allows for simulations of large populations and can simulate transient dynamics, but it requires careful grid generation and management of stationary points and limit cycles. The grid can be made coarse in state space but a fine time step is needed for accurate results. The method is robust and has been shown to accurately reproduce results from one-dimensional models and the diffusion limit. The method can be used to study the effects of noise on neural populations in a two-dimensional representation.
The paper describes the purification and biological activity of a protein called croin from the venom of the rattlesnake Crotalus viridis. The protein was found to have low toxicity to mammalian cells and mouse muscles, even at high concentrations. It was shown to have anti-parasitic activity against both infective trypanosomatid forms (trypomastigotes and amastigotes) and intracellular amastigotes of Leishmania and Trypanosoma cruzi. The intracellular activity was particularly promising as amastigotes are key developmental stages of the parasite life cycle that are difficult to target with current treatments. The study suggests that croin could be a potential alternative compound for the development of new drugs against leishmaniasis and Chagas' disease, which currently rely on toxic and less effective drugs.
The paper discusses how the actin cytoskeleton in eukaryotic cells can restricts the replication of the tombusvirus TBSV by the plus-stranded RNA virus. TBSV replication requires two viral proteins, p3 and p92, which have different functions. The p3 protein recruits TBSV to the cytosolic surface of peroxisomal membranes, while the p92 protein acts as a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. However, the replication of TBSV is inhibited by the host cellular actin cytoskeleton, particularly the cofilin actin depolymerization factor. The cofilin factor binds to p3 and inhibits its interaction with ADP-actin, which is needed for actin disassembly and recycling of actin monomers to form new actin filaments. This inhibits the dynamic actin network, allowing the virus to concentralize host and viral components at replication sites. The actin network also affects the availability of host factors for VRC assembly. The authors propose that TBSV takes advantage of the defective sterol transport mechanism in cofilin and actin mutants that allows the virus to easily hijack sterols and enrich them at replication sites, leading to efficient VRC assembly and increased viral RNA synthesis. Inhibition of the dynamic actin network by cofilin mutations or actin inhibitors leads to increased TBSV replication, suggesting that the actin network is a key factor in restricting TBSV replication. This could be a more general phenomenon, as disruption of the actin network leads to increased susceptibility to pathogenic bacteria due to inhibition of the innate immunity response.
This paper discusses how the stable patterning of the Bcd gradient in Drosophila embryos and the precise readout of the Bcd gradient can be explained using a simple model. The model shows that the rapid transport of Bcd molecules from the anterior pole to nuclei during nuclear cycles is necessary to establish a stable Bcd distribution, which then enables the self-averaging of Hb molecules through diffusion to produce a precise and reproducible Hb distribution. The self-averaging of Hb molecules through diffusion masks the large fluctuations in the Hb activity and readout of the Bcd gradient, resolving the so-called "paradox of signal interpretation". The authors argue that the mechanism of self-averaging through diffusion is sufficient to explain the observed stable and precise patterning of both Bcd and Hb molecules, and does not require synchronized gene switching or positive feedback. They propose that the coordinated diffusion of input and output molecules is the basis for generating the stable, precise, and reproducible profiles of Bcd and Hb molecules.
The paper describes a new potential drug candidate, nitazoxanide (NTZ), that shows promise as a treatment for tuberculosis. The authors found that NTZ stimulates autophagy, inhibits mTORC1 signaling, and inhibits intracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) growth in human cells. NTZ acts by in part by inhibiting quinone oxidoreductase NQO1, which is a key upstream regulator of mTORC1. The authors suggest that NTZ's ability to inhibit NQO1 may contribute to its ability to stimulate autophagy and inhibit MTB growth by increasing oxidative stress. The drug is safe and effective, and could potentially be used in combination with existing tuberculosis drugs to increase efficacy and reduce toxicity. The results suggest that drugs that target autophagy and mTORC1 signaling in addition to directly killing MTB may provide new opportunities to combat intracellular pathogens like MTB.
The paper describes the trends of Mycobacterium bovis isolation and first-line drug susceptibility at a tertiary care hospital in Mexico from 20000 to 2014. The study found that the proportion of M. bovis isolates in the laboratory increased from 7.8% to 28.4% over the 15 year period, with 62% of M. bovis isolates coming from pulmonary samples. 52% of samples from HIV infected patients were M. bovis. The study also found a rising trend in the proportion of cases caused by M. bovis. The proportion of first-line anti-tuberculosis drug resistance was higher for M. bovis isolates, with 10.9% showing monoresistance to streptomycin, 3.2% showing multidrug resistance, and 1.9% showing total multidrug resistance. The study highlights the need for proper identification of M. bovis and drug susceptibility testing when M. bovis is suspected, given the high proportion of primary resistance to INH and RIF and the potential for development of MDR strains.
This paper describes a comprehensive catalog of genetic variants in the Drosophila melanogaster species, including single nucleotide polymorphisms, insertions, deletions, and complex variants. The authors used whole-genome sequencing data from 39 inbred lines to generate a catalog of 3.6 million variants, including 2.8 million single nucleotide polymorphisms, 0.6 million indels, and 0.2 million complex variants. They identified 1750,000 cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTLs) associated with gene expression changes in young adult flies. They found that the majority of cis-eQTLs are sex-specific, with males having more cis-eQTLs than females. The cis-eQTLs were found to be enriched in H3K4me3 regions and showed an enhanced effect compared to previously known gene expression changes. The authors also identified sex-unbiased cis-QTLs that were expressed in both males and females. They validated their cis-eQTLs using RNA-seq data from reciprocal crosses of two lines and found that many of the associated transcripts exhibited allelic imbalance in the crosses, providing evidence that the cis-QTLs were causal. The catalog of variants provides a valuable resource for studying gene expression variation and cis-regulatory architecture in Drosophila.
This paper investigated how genetic variants associated with body mass index (BMI) interact with different lifestyle factors in a large UK Biobank dataset. They found that genetic variants associated with BMI interacted with factors like alcohol consumption frequency, physical activity levels, socioeconomic status, and sleep quality. The study found that genetic variants associated with BMI had a smaller effect on BMI in individuals who drank more alcohol, indicating that the genetic effect was attenuated for more frequent drinkers. This is consistent with previous studies showing that moderate alcohol consumption is associated with lower BMI. The study also found that genetic variants interacted with factors like smoking status, number of vehicles in the household and tiredness levels, indicating that these factors have a larger impact on BMI. The study found that combining genetic variants into a genetic score before testing interactions with lifestyle factors increased the statistical power, but also had limitations since some genetic variants may interact in opposite directions. The study used standardized self-reported questionnaire data to collect lifestyle factors and found that the data was valid for factors like alcohol and physical activity. The study suggests that confounding factors not included in the models may still affect the results and controlled experiments are needed to fully understand the causal relationships between genetic variants and lifestyle factors.
The paper describes a new method for analyzing single particle trajectories of cell surface proteins to identify the different states they can be in and how they switch between those states. The method uses a two-state hidden Markov model, which assumes the particle can be in one of two states (either free or bound) at each time step, and estimates the diffusion coefficients and transition probabilities between the states. The authors test this model on experimental data of LFA-1 trajectories on T cells, showing that it can accurately identify the two states and quantify the transition probabilities, diffusion coefficients and equilibrium constant. The method can distinguish between two states and provide information about the details of the transitions between them, which is not possible with traditional mean squared displacement analysis. The approach uses a likelihood maximization technique to fit the data to the model and identify the most likely parameters, and can be extended to account for more complex models or modes of motion. The authors find that the method provides a more detailed understanding of how the LFA-1 protein dynamics are regulated by its interactions with the cytoskeleton.
The paper describes a systematic analysis of thousands of internal ribosome entry site (IRES) sequences from human and different viruses using a high-throughput IRES activity assay. They trained random forest models to predict IRES activity from sequence features and identified robust and predictive k-mer features that could be classified into two types: pyrimidine-rich elements and purine-rich elements. The pyrimidine-rich features were found to be associated with positive IRES activity, while purine-rich features had a negative effect. The poly-U and pyrimidine tract k-mers were found to be consistent with known ITAF binding motifs and were predictive for both global and positional features. The results suggest that different virus types preferentially rely on different ITAFs for IRES initiation, with retroviruses preferring PCBP-1/2 RBPs and C-rich k-mers. The positional features showed that k-mers with a positive effect tended to be located around positions -50 and -20 upstream of the start codon, while those with a negative effect tended to be located around positions -150. The paper concludes that the results provide a high-level IRES architecture of sequence features and their spatial organization that could guide future synthetic IRES designs and shed light on the relationship between IRES initiation and viral evolution.
This paper aims to identify genes that switch between different protein variants during development in the human brain. The authors analyze gene expression data from human brains across multiple age groups to identify genes that show a correlation in their expression profiles that is anti-correlated over time, indicating a developmental switch. They focus on genes that participate in synaptic signal transduction pathways and find several examples of such switches, including glycine receptors and serotonin receptors. The authors show that these switches occur in specific brain regions and age groups, and suggest that they may allow the brain to fine-tune the properties of synapses and information processing. The authors propose a systematic approach to detect such developmental switches based on correlations in expression profiles and sequence similarity between genes. They analyze three datasets and find many examples of switches, including the previously known switch of the NMDA receptor subunit NR2B to NR2A. The switches occur early in development and continue into infancy and childhood, which has implications for how the brain processes early experiences. The authors propose future experiments to further investigate the mechanisms and effects of these switches.
The paper describes a method called Spatial Multi-Criteria Evaluation (SCE) to identify areas where Rift Valley Fever (RVF) virus may occur in livestock in Eastern Africa. The authors used a Geographic Information System (GIS) to combine factors from scientific literature and expert knowledge to produce maps of areas with high and low suitability for RVF transmission. The method included factors related to mosquito presence and density, livestock density, proximity to markets, roads and railways, water bodies, and wildlife parks. The maps showed that areas in Kenya and Tanzania had high suitability for both RVF amplification and spread, while areas in Uganda and Ethiopia had low suitability for amplification but high suitability for spread. The maps were validated using data on RVF outbreaks in livestock, with 74% of outbreaks occurring in areas with high suitability for RVF occurrence. The authors found that their method performed better than other climate-based models and identified areas that were previously free from RVF outbreaks but likely had the potential to become infected. The results suggest that combining factors related to livestock movements and trade, in addition to environmental conditions, can improve predictive models of RVF occurrence. However, the method has limitations due to the unavailability of data on some factors and the choice of threshold for defining high suitability areas. The approach provides a useful starting point for identifying areas to focus surveillance and control efforts.
This paper shows that the rate of genetic evolution in populations with spatial structure, such as where individuals are clustered in different locations, can be different from the rate of evolution in a well-mixed population. The authors analyze how the spatial structure of a population affects the rate of neutral genetic evolution, which is evolution that does not have a selective advantage or disadvantage. They find that the rate of evolution in a spatially structured population can be either faster or slower than the rate in a well-mixed population, depending on how birth and death rates vary across different locations. They show that if there is more turnover in one part of the population, the rate of evolution can be faster, and if there is more death than birth in another part, the rate can be slower. This is because new mutations are more likely to arise in areas with higher turnover, and the probability of fixation depends on the initial location of the mutation. They find that the rate of evolution can take any value less than the rate in a well-mixed population, depending on the birth and death rates across different locations. This suggests that the rate of evolution in spatially structured populations can be affected by the spatial arrangement of individuals, not just the overall population size.
The paper describes how the polycistronic mRNA of the BDV virus is translated. The mRNA encodes three proteins, X, P, and uORF. The X protein is translated from the uORF upstream of the P protein, but the uORF itself is translated from the AUG codon. The paper shows that the uORF termination codon plays a key role in the translation of the X protein. The paper identifies RNA helicase DX2 as a regulator of the translation from the uORF. When the P protein is expressed, it upregulates the translation of the X protein, which in turn reduces the translation of the P protein. The P protein inhibits the binding of DX2 to the uORF, which leads to increased translation of the X protein. The paper proposes that the structural alteration of the uORF by DX2 and other proteins likely causes the decrease in ribosomal reinitiation of the X protein.
The paper investigates the evolutionary history of a gene called the bgl operon in Escherichia coli, which is often referred to as "cryptic" because it is repressed by a protein called HNS and is not expressed under standard laboratory conditions. The authors analyzed the bgl operon in 171 E. coli strains representing the species diversity and found that different types of the operon were present, corresponding to different clonal groups. They found that the bgl operon is maintained in strains of the phylogenetic group B2, which includes extra-intestinal pathogens, and is silenced in the other groups. The bgl operon is also found in rare representatives of an early diverging population of E. coli. Orthologs of the operon genes were found in related species Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Erwinia, indicating that the operon was acquired by horizontal transfer from low-GC-content Gram-positive bacteria. The authors propose that silencing of the bgl operon provides a selective advantage in the extra-intestinal environment, allowing it to be expressed under certain conditions in vivo. However, the molecular basis for the relaxed expression in strains of the phylogenetic group B2 remains unclear. The study provides a snapshot of the ongoing evolution of a locus that was acquired horizontally and then evolved clonally in commensal and pathogenic E. coli.
The paper discusses the genetic diversity of a gene called the kine (kin) in Leishmania donovani, a parasite that causes visceral leishmaniasis, a major public health problem in parts of Africa, South Asia and Brazil. The kine gene encodes for a protein that is used in diagnostic tests to diagnose visceral leishmaniasis. The paper compares the genetic diversity of kines from East African and South Asian Leishmania strains and finds that East African strains have more genetic diversity in the kine gene, which may contribute to lower sensitivity of diagnostic tests that use the kine protein. This suggests that diagnostic tests that use the kine protein may be less accurate for detecting visceral leishmaniasis in East Africa compared to South Asia. The authors recommend further research to better understand the genetic diversity of the kine gene and the immune response of East African populations to improve diagnostic tests. They argue that there is a need for more accessible collections of Leishmania strains representative of genetic lineages and whole genome sequencing to better understand the genetic diversity of the parasite, as well as targeted analysis of individual strains to compare genetic diversity. They also suggest that comparative genomics can help guide the optimization of diagnostic antigens.
The paper proposes a new framework to study how intrinsic noise in complex networks can lead to avalanching, a phenomenon where bursts of activity occur irregularly and irregularly. The authors focus on Markovian networks with binary state dynamics, where nodes are either active or inactive. They find that as the network size decreases, the noise-induced potential energy landscape deforms, leading to the emergence of noise-induced modes that are stable at subcritical network sizes. These noise-induced modes cause the fractional activity process to fluctuate in a Gaussian-like manner, leading to bursting behavior. The authors argue that avalanching is a complex behavior caused by the emergence of these noise-induced modes, rather than the balanced feedforward structure that was previously thought to be necessary. They show that critical behavior occurs at subcritical network sizes due to the deformation of the potential energy landscape, and demonstrate this through simulations of stochastic models and analysis of thermodynamic quantities like pressure and bulk modulus. The framework provides a link between statistical mechanics and dynamic criticality and can be used to study complex phenomena like avalanching in non-equilibrium systems like biological networks.
The paper describes a new approach to studying the linguistic history of the continent of Sahul (Australia and New Guinea) by analyzing the structural features of 121 languages from the region. The traditional comparative method of linguistics, which looks at lexical cognates, is not applicable in this case due to the lack of identifiable cognates and regular sound correspondences. The authors therefore use a clustering algorithm called Structure to group languages into populations based on their structural features, which can capture historical relationships even where there is little or no genetic evidence. The analysis found 7 major groups of languages: TNG (Papuan), South-Papuan, North-West Papuan, North-East Papuan, PN, non-PN, AN, and two Oceanic groups. Within the Oceanic group, there were subgroups of New Britain and Trans-Fly languages. The results provide evidence for ancient splits between these groups and can be used to infer the impact of migrations and language contact on the languages. The study suggests that the AN expansion into eastern Indonesia occurred more recently and has had more impact on the languages of eastern New Guinea. The findings provide a new perspective on the population history of Sahul and can be used to inform population genetic studies.
The paper investigated how the Mediator complex regulates retrotransposition of Ty1 elements in yeast. Retrotransposition involves the Ty1 element transcribing into RNA and then integrating into the genome. The Mediator complex is a transcriptional activator that regulates Ty1 expression. The paper found that different subunits of the Mediator complex have different effects on Ty1 mobility. Deleting subunits of the tail module that contains subunits Med2-Med15 results in increased Ty1 mobility. This suggests that the tail module regulates Ty1 mobility by recruiting Pol II to the Ty1 promoter. This mechanism operates independently of Ty1 expression levels. Deleting head and middle module subunits resulted in reduced Ty1 mobility. The paper proposes that the tail module regulates the balance between Ty1 and Ty1i expression, which in turn affects Ty1 mobility. The study also found that loss of the tail module subunits results in increased Tyi RNA levels. This suggests that the tail module acts to favor Ty1 expression over Tyi expression, which inhibits retrotransposition. The study provides a mechanism for how a transcriptional activator can regulate a gene by acting post-transcriptionally. The findings provide insights into how retrotransposition is regulated and may have implications for understanding gene expression in other organisms.
The paper discusses how the dynamics of complex systems, like protein folding, can be described using a free energy surface (FES) projected onto a small number of coordinates. The authors show that if the reaction coordinate is properly optimized, the dynamics projected onto this coordinate is diffusive, while dynamics projected onto a suboptimal coordinate is sub-diffusive. They argue that a properly chosen reaction coordinate is necessary to make the dynamics diffusive. However, simply choosing a reaction coordinate does not necessarily mean that the dynamics itself is sub-diffusive. The optimum reaction coordinate is constructed by optimizing the mean first passage time to the native basin, which gives the best reaction coordinate that can distinguish between the different free energy basins. They demonstrate this by analyzing the dynamics of the lambda repressor protein using two different reaction coordinates and showing that the optimum coordinate has a higher free energy barrier and thus closer dynamics to diffusion. The optimum reaction coordinate can be used to describe the dynamics as diffusion on the reaction coordinate, while sub-optimal coordinates result in sub-diffusive dynamics. The paper highlights that a properly chosen reaction coordinate is important for accurately modeling protein folding dynamics.
This paper investigated how people categorize sounds in a way that is influenced by both prior knowledge and sensory information. The study found that people can learn category probabilities and use them to make categorization decisions, but they do not always use an optimal strategy. Instead, they tend to use a probability-matching approach that chooses the option with the highest probability according to their current sensory uncertainty. This leads to shallow psychometric functions with plateaus. The paper suggests that people's categorical behavior may reflect their assumptions about the stationarity of the environment, which are not always correct. The results suggest that people's categorization strategies may be more influenced by their view of the environment as stationary than by the optimal decision-making strategies they employ. The findings challenge assumptions about how people categorize and how models of categorization should be structured.
The paper describes a model of how the olfactory system in locusts is able to distinguish between different odors while still maintaining robustness to repeated presentations of the same odor. The model shows that lateral excitation and slow inhibition from local interneurons play complementary roles in achieving this goal. Lateral excitation allows more neurons to be recruited, which can distinguish between similar odors. However, this can compromise the robustness to repeated presentations of the same odor. Slow inhibition reduces the activity of more neurons, which helps maintain the robustness. The model shows that a balance of lateral excitation and slow inhibition is needed to achieve both sensitivity to small odor differences and robustness to noise. This balance is found to be optimal when firing rates of neurons are distributed optimally across the population. The study suggests that lateral excitation and inhibition in the olfactory lobe provide a functional circuit that enhances odor representations, allowing the system to classify odors while maintaining robustness to repeated presentations.
The paper describes the construction and analysis of a new population of genetically diverse and highly recombinant Arabidopsis thaliana lines called MAGIC (Multiparent Advanced Generation Intercross) lines. These lines were created by interbreeding 19 natural accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana over 4-6 generations, then selfing for 6 more generations to produce a stable panel of inbred lines. The MAGIC lines are genotyped at high density and used to map quantitative traits like bolting time and germination rate. The authors show that the MAGIC lines are more powerful than traditional RILs (recombinant inbred lines descended from two accessions) for detecting and fine-mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) because they have more genetic and phenotypic variation and are less prone to population structure. They use statistical methods to identify QTL and map them to single gene resolution. The results identify known genes as causal for the glabrous and erecta binary traits and also reveal new candidate genes for natural variation in flowering time. The MAGIC lines represent an important tool for dissecting the genetic basis of plant growth and development and could help improve crop varieties.
This paper describes a new method to test the effect of drugs on the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi using a technique called Biospeckle interferometry. This involves shining a laser beam on the parasites in a flat-bottom VDRL plate and measuring changes in the speckle patterns. The method was tested with Trypanosoma cruzi epimastigotes and benznidazole as a drug. The authors found that the activity of the Biospeckle pattern increases as the number of parasites in the well increases, regardless of the volume of liquid. They were able to detect the effect of different concentrations of benznidazole on the Biospeckle pattern, but the effect of high concentrations was only seen after 1 hour. The method showed that the activity of the Biospeckle pattern is proportional to the number of parasites in the well. However, the method has limitations in terms of detecting the IC50 of the drug due to the effects of desiccation and saturation. The authors suggest that a parametric analysis of the Biospeckle pattern with respect to viability needs to be performed to determine the IC50.
This paper discusses how the emergence of the first genetic material from chemical precursors may have occurred. The authors use a model based on the quasispecies theory and the thermodynamics of RNA replication to show how random sequences of RNA molecules gradually became more stable and error-free over time, eventually forming the first genomes. They argue that the error threshold for RNA replication, where error rates are low enough to allow stable genomes, is determined by a thermodynamic force that pushes the population towards higher fidelity. They propose that this force emerged gradually over time as RNA replication became more efficient through the evolution of polymerases that selectively incorporated nucleotides. This led to an increase in error threshold as the error rates of RNA polymerases decreased. The authors also show how the emergence of genomes is analogous to a phase transition, where error-free genomes are stable while error-prone genomes are like a liquid. They conclude that the emergence of genomes was driven by a thermodynamic force that pushed the population towards higher fidelity, rather than any particular mechanism.
This paper used a synthetic biology approach to study how the strength of individual binding sites within a promoter affects the transcriptional output of a gene. The researchers created four different libraries of a promoter that contained either the consensus or a weaker binding site at the -35 position, and either the consensus or an anti-consensus site at the -10 position. They measured the relative fitness of each binding site within each library by counting the number of hexamers (sequences of 6 nucleotides) that contained that site. They found that the fitness of a binding site generally increased with the strength of the binding site, but the relationship between fitness and binding site strength was highly context-dependent. In general, the fitness of a binding site was highest at the most stringent conditions and decreased as the concentration of tetracycline increased. However, at low concentrations of tetracycline, the fitness of the consensus site was generally highest, indicating that the optimal binding site was needed for maximum stability of the transcription initiation complex. They also found that binding sites close together in sequence space had a higher fitness than distant sites, and that spacings between the -35 and -10 positions affected transcription initiation. These results demonstrate that the strength of individual binding sites can significantly affect the transcriptional output of a gene, and that the optimal binding site strength can be compensated by weaker binding sites, but the optimal binding site strength does not necessarily correspond to the highest affinity. The approach used in this study provides insight into the mechanism of transcriptional regulation and how binding site strength and context interact to determine transcriptional output.
The paper proposes a model to analyze gene expression data using ChIP-seq data to study the dynamics of protein-DNA interactions and transcription. The model uses a convolved Gaussian process to model the transcription dynamics of genes. The convolved model allows the model to capture correlations between different regions of genes, which helps identify genes that are actively transcribed and infer their transcriptional activity. The model can identify genes that are responsive to estrogen signaling by fitting the delay parameters. The delay parameters are found to be non-decreasing, which allows the model to filter out genes that are not actively transcribed. The model can also estimate the transcription speeds for genes. The approach was applied to a ChIP-seq dataset from breast cancer cells treated with estrogen to identify transcriptionally engaged genes and estimate their transcription speeds. The results showed good agreement with previous studies and provided insights into the transcriptional response to estrogen signaling. The approach has the advantage of being able to analyze genome-wide expression data without requiring high temporal resolution data. The approach can be used to identify transcriptional pausing events, predict regulatory relationships and study the link between transcription dynamics and alternative splicing.
This paper investigated how the nucleosome acidic patch on histones H2A and H2AX is involved in the DNA damage response pathway in human cells. The authors found that the nucleosome acidic patch is required for RNF168 and RING1B/BMI1-dependent histone ubiquitination of H2AX and H2A. They identified the acidic patch on H2AX as a critical component of this process and showed that it mediates site-specific histone ubiquitination. They used an experimental approach to target the acidic patch of H2A and H2AX in vivo by expressing a protein called LANA that binds to the nucleosome acidic patch. They found that LANA expression inhibited RNF168 and RING1B/BMI1-dependent histone ubiquitination, leading to reduced 53BP1 foci formation and DNA end-resection. These results suggest that the nucleosome acidic patch functions in vivo to promote RNF168 and RING1B/BMI1-dependent DNA damage signaling and are required for 53BP1 recruitment to DNA damage sites. The findings provide evidence that the DNA damage response engages the nucleosome acidic patch to mediate histone ubiquitinations that write the histone code and recruit DDR factors to chromatin. The study identifies the first nucleosome domain that participates in both H2A/H2AX ubiquitination and the DNA damage response in human cells.
The paper discusses the potential for Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) to emerge in North America and how it could spread and infect humans and animals. The authors analyzed data from published studies to identify the mosquitoes and vertebrates that could potentially contribute to RVFV transmission in the US if it arrives. They found that mammals, specifically cattle, sheep, goats and buffalo, may be important amplification hosts for the virus, but more data is needed to fully understand their role. They identified the mosquitoes that could potentially be the most capable of transmitting RVFV, including Coquillettidia perturbans, Aedes japonicus and Aedes sollicitans. However, they also noted that many gaps exist in knowledge about the vector and host competence of RVFV, including the lack of data for many mosquito species and vertebrate hosts in the US. The authors argue that filling these gaps in knowledge could inform proactive management programs to prepare for a potential RVFV introduction and help parameterize models for evaluating environmental receptivity in the US. They suggest future research should focus on evaluating the vector and host competence in high-risk areas and characterizing the RVFV viremia profiles of US vertebrates, particularly domestic animals like cattle, sheep, goats and buffalo.
The paper describes a new tool called NINJA-OPS that can accurately and quickly assign marker gene sequences to a reference database of known marker genes. This is useful for identifying the taxonomic composition of environmental microbial communities. The key innovation is using the Burrows-Wheeler transform to map the marker genes to a compact string representation, which enables fast substring searching for matching reads. The tool first filters out duplicate reads, then aligns the filtered reads to the marker genes using the BWT-based aligner. This approach allows the tool to find matches with a higher accuracy and speed than existing tools, up to two orders of magnitude faster. The filtering step also helps reduce the number of reads that are actually aligned, further increasing the speed. The tool can be used for marker genes beyond the commonly used 16S marker genes, and is flexible enough to be incorporated into other pipelines like de novo assembly. The authors conclude that the BWT-based approach can scale better with longer reads and is a good option for marker gene sequencing.
This paper describes a study that aimed to identify genetic markers associated with the ability to pace or trot in horses. The study used genome-wide association analysis (GWA) and whole-genome sequencing to identify genetic variants associated with the gait phenotype in a large cohort of Standardbred horses. The GWA analysis identified 19 genetic markers that were associated with gait at a genome-wide significance level. The study then used random forest analysis to prioritize the most important markers among the many thousands of statistically significant markers. Seven of these markers were found to be highly predictive of being a pacer or trotter, with an accuracy of over 90%. The study used whole-genome sequencing to identify variants within regions of interest defined by the GWA analysis, and found that a small number of variants were likely to be functional. The study concludes that identifying genetic markers associated with gait may provide insight into the underlying neurobiology of locomotion and potentially be useful for marker-assisted selection and training decisions.
The paper describes the identification and characterization of a new protein called v-GAAP (viral anti-apoptotic protein) that is encoded by the poxvirus VACV. v-GAAP is expressed early in in in infection and localizes to the Golgi. It is found to be conserved in many eukaryotes, including humans, and is essential for cell viability. v-GAAP inhibits apoptosis induced by a wide range of pro-apoptotic stimuli, including those that act through both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. When the v-GAAP protein is deleted from VACV, it affects its virulence in a murine model of infection. The human and viral v-GAAPs are similar in sequence, length, and hydrophobicity, and function, suggesting that they were acquired from the host. v-GAAP inhibits apoptosis in a step downstream of caspase-8 activation, possibly at the mitochondrial membrane. The study identifies v-GAAP as a new virus-encoded regulator of apoptosis and demonstrates that viruses can acquire genes from their hosts to combat the host's response to infection.
The paper discusses the results of a clinical trial in Uganda that evaluated the effectiveness and safety of fractional doses of a meningoccal polysaccharide vaccine compared to the full dose in controlling meningoccal meningitis outbreaks in sub-Saharan Africa. The study found that while fractional doses (1/5 or 1/10 of the full dose) were non-inferior to the full dose in inducing bactericidal antibodies against the serogroups W15 and Y, they were not as effective against serogroup A. The results suggest that fractional doses may be a useful strategy for mass vaccination campaigns in areas where the full dose is not available or too expensive, especially for children under 5 years old. However, the study had some limitations, including that a significant proportion of participants already had high antibody levels against serogroup A before vaccination, and the lack of HIV testing. The study suggests that fractional doses could potentially reduce the cost of vaccination and increase the number of people protected, but more research is needed to fully understand their effectiveness and safety.
This paper investigated how insects manufacture their hard outer shells with different mechanical properties, such as hard and flexible cuticles. The authors focused on the elytra of adult beetles, which has a hard, sclerotized dorsal cuticle and a flexible ventral cuticle. They identified two proteins called TcCPR27 and TcCPR18 that are highly abundant in the elytra and are required for its formation and mechanical properties. The proteins were found to be expressed at higher levels during the pupal stage, before the elytra becomes rigid, and are absent in the flexible ventral cuticle. The authors showed that knocking down the expression of these proteins resulted in malformed elytra that were unable to properly fold and had a higher loss of mechanical strength. They suggest that these proteins are important for preventing dehydration and death of the adult. The study demonstrates that individual cuticular proteins play important roles in defining the morphology and properties of the elytra and rigid body cuticle. Future studies are needed to determine how these proteins are localized and covalently cross-linked during the cuticle formation process.
The paper describes the development of genetically modified mosquitoes that have a mechanism to selectively target and kill male mosquitoes carrying the Y chromosome. The modified mosquitoes were created by expressing an enzyme called I-PpoI during sperm formation that cleaves the X chromosome in male testes, resulting in a distorted sex ratio of mostly males. The modified males were completely sterile and all of their spermatozoa carried the I-PpoI enzyme, which could introduce DNA damage into the female pronuclei during fertilization, leading to early embryo arrest. This approach could potentially be used to control mosquito populations by selectively targeting male mosquitoes and reducing their numbers. The study demonstrates that the modified mosquitoes are not impaired in their ability to mate with normal females, and that the I-PpoI enzyme can be transferred to all spermzoa regardless of whether they carry the transgene, making it a promising tool for vector control.
The paper describes the crystal structure of the DNA-binding domain of the latent nuclear antigen (LANA) protein from the gamma-herpesvirus 6 virus. LANA is a key protein that helps the virus establish a persistent infection in the host by infecting B cells. The study shows that the positively charged surface of the LANA protein on the dorsal side is important for its ability to bind to DNA and establish latency in B cells. The researchers found that mutations in this positively charged surface abolish LANA's ability to bind DNA and therefore the virus's ability to persist in the host. The structure of the LANA protein reveals a novel structural motif with a patch of positively charged lysine residues that is important for its DNA binding. The findings support a model where the virus uses this strategy to colonize the host by infecting B cells in the spleen and establishing a persistent infection in long-lived memory B cells. The crystal structure provides advantages for studying the mechanism of LANA function and how it helps the virus persist in the host.
The paper proposes a model to explain how the brain encodes and decodes odor information. The model consists of two parts: a generative model that simulates the dynamics of neuron populations in the antennal lobe and mushroom body, and a Bayesian inference scheme that infers the hidden states of Kenyon cells (KCs) based on the activity of projection neurons (PNs. The generative model uses Lotka-Volterra equations to model sequential activation patterns in PNs, while the Bayesian inference uses unscented Kalman filters to model the KCs. The model achieves fast and robust odor recognition by transforming highly overlapping PN patterns into sparse KC activations. The Bayesian inference mechanism acts as an "intelligent coincidence detector" that can identify the correct odor among multiple alternatives based on the similarity between the KC trajectories. Experiments show that the model can recognize odors quickly and robustly, even against unexpected deviations in PN activity. The model also provides mechanistic explanations for several key phenomena observed in insect olfactory experiments, such as the steady state response and the behavior of KCs as intelligent coincidence detectors.
The paper examines how socioeconomic inequalities in body mass index (BMI) have changed across different generations in the UK. Using data from three historical birth cohort studies born between 1946, 1958, and 1970, the researchers found that socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals in childhood were more likely to have higher BMIs in adulthood, and this trend persisted across different generations. Specifically, among women, socioeconomic inequalities in BMI were larger in the more recent cohorts, while among men, the trend was only observed among the most recent cohort. The study suggests that inequalities in BMI are driven by inequalities in the determinants of weight gain both before and during adulthood, such as diet and physical activity, which have not substantially changed despite policies aimed at reducing them. The study highlights the need for early interventions targeting socioeconomic resources to reduce inequalities in BMI, particularly among those born in more recent generations.
The paper discusses the potential benefits of using a miltefosine direct observed therapy (DOT) protocol for treating pediatric patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis, a neglected tropical disease that primarily affects poor populations. The authors performed a cost-effectiveness analysis using a Monte Carlo simulation model to compare the costs of miltefosine DOT versus standard intramuscular treatment (MA). The model showed that miltefosine DOT was less costly from a societal perspective, with savings of up to $42 per cure and $18 per cure for patient and government payer perspective, respectively. The model also found that miltefosine DOT remained cost-saving even when assumptions about adherence, drug costs, and other costs were varied. The authors argue that while there are limitations to the study, the results suggest that a miltefosine DOT protocol could be a more cost-effective treatment option for pediatric patients, particularly in remote areas where patients face economic and geographic barriers to accessing standard treatment.
The study investigated how chronic infections with soil-transmitted helminths (STH) modulate immune responses in children. The researchers found that children with chronic STH infections had higher levels of cytokines such as GM-CSF, IL-2, and IL-10 in their unstimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells compared to those without chronic infections. These cytokines are associated with a modified Th2 response and may help the parasites survive but prevent excessive inflammation. The study also found that chronic STH infections downregulated the expression of the microRNA hsa-let-7d, which may play a role in regulating the immune response. The results suggest that chronic STH infections have complex effects on immune homeostasis, modulating neutrophil-mediated inflammation and immune responses. The study provides evidence that chronic STH infections may develop a "tolerant" immune response that is distinct from classical Th2 immunity and could lead to the development of new therapies for inflammation.
This paper discusses how the extracellular proteins on the surface of African trypanosomes, which are called VSGs, interact with immunoglobulins from the host immune system. The VSGs are made up of two domains, an N-terminal and C-terminal domain. VSGs are linked together by flexible linkers and are free to diffuse in the plasma membrane. The VSGs cover the entire surface of the cell. While VSGs are very abundant, they do not bind to immunoglobulins in live cells, suggesting that they form a physical barrier that restricts access to the VSGs. The VSGs have an N-terminal domain with a large cross-sectional area that is perpendicular to the cell surface, which is the most accessible part of the VSG. Some immunoglobulins have been shown to bind to the VSGs, but they do not provide protection against infection. The paper concludes that the VSG coat likely acts as a physical barrier to prevent access of immunoglobulins to invariant surface proteins like invariant surface glycoproteins, but may also combine this barrier with an active system that negates antibody binding to VSGs. The exact mechanism of this tolerance is not fully understood and requires further research.
This paper describes the discovery of a new sensory modality in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans that allows it to detect and respond to ultraviolet light. The worms were found to have a strong response to short wavelength light, which they use as an escape mechanism to avoid direct sunlight exposure. The researchers identified a gene called LITE-1 that is responsible for detecting ultraviolet light and activating a light-induced locomotion response in neurons. They showed that LITE-1 is expressed in neurons and muscles and can be expressed in heterologous cells, allowing the worms to respond to light even in tissues that normally do not respond to light. The light-induced locomotion response was found to be strong enough to rescue paralyzed synaptic signaling mutants, suggesting that LITE-1 can activate neurons independently of the synaptic signals that normally trigger locomotion. The finding suggests that the worms often live on surfaces exposed to sunlight and the light-induced response helps them avoid lethal doses of UV light. The discovery of a novel sensory modality in C. elegans could lead to new tools for photoactivation of neurons in living animals and investigation of cAMP and DAG-based synaptic signaling pathways.
The paper investigates how the brain processes depth cues (binocular disparity and relative motion) to perceive 3D structures. The authors compare the results from monkey and human brains using fMRI. They find that while the human brain's area V3B/KO is specialized for integrating these cues and shows fusion of depth cues, the monkey brain shows a hybrid response with both congruent and incongruent cells. In the monkey brain, area MT is found to be the main area for depth cue integration, but other areas like V3d also show evidence of integration. The authors propose that the fusion of depth cues likely occurred in an area more caudal to MT in the monkey brain. The results suggest that the fusion of depth cues in the monkey brain is different from that in the human brain. While the fusion of depth cues in the human brain is likely in area V3B/KO, the monkey brain may have had an earlier area for this function that drifted caudally during evolution. The findings provide evidence for a fusion mechanism for depth perception in the primate visual cortex and highlight the difference in how the brain processes depth cues between species.
The paper describes a new computational method to infer signaling networks from phosphoproteomics data. The method uses graph-based algorithms to connect proteins that have similar phosphorylation patterns, called "co-regulated phospho-peptides", and then uses the known protein-protein interactions to infer a regulatory network that controls the phosphoproteome. The authors applied this method to a dataset of phosphoproteomics data from yeast cells exposed to high salt stress, and identified many new connections between phosphorylation events and cellular processes. The method was able to predict phosphorylation targets that were not directly linked by known protein interactions, and also predicted feedback loops between regulators. The results showed that the HOG kinase and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) pathways are important regulators of cell growth during stress, and that the phosphorylation of some proteins is connected to the PKA pathway through a previously unknown phosphodiase. The method also identified novel phosphorylation sites that are targets of the Hog1 kinase and Rck2 kinase. Overall, the results provide new insights into how cells coordinate cellular processes during stress and suggest potential new targets for further experimental validation.
This paper investigated the role of the microRNA miR-202 in the ovary of the medaka fish. It found that miR-202 plays a key role in the early steps of folliculogenesis and is required for the formation of functional gametes in both female and male gonads. The study showed that miR-202 is expressed in the granulosa cells surrounding the oocyte and plays a role in regulating the growth and proliferation of these cells. The knockout of miR-202 leads to a severe reduction in the fecundity and viability of eggs, indicating that miR-202 is necessary for the female reproductive success. The study also identified several genes that are differentially expressed in the ovary of miR-202 knockout fish, including genes involved in steroid hormone synthesis and the regulation of the circadian clock. The findings provide new insights into the regulatory mechanisms that control the early steps of follicular development in the ovary and demonstrate that microRNAs are involved in the female reproductive success.
This paper discusses the potential of loss-of-function mutations (null mutations) in bacteria to adapt to new environments. The authors find that even when bacteria lack the necessary biochemical functions or express them inappropriately, loss-of-function mutations can rewire the regulatory and metabolic networks, allowing the organism to utilize its existing capabilities more effectively. They demonstrate this by showing that loss-of-function mutations in enzymes, regulatory proteins, and housekeeping genes can significantly improve bacterial fitness in extreme environments like those with limited nutrients. They analyze the mechanisms by which these mutations allow this adaptation through flux variability analysis and transcriptome analysis. They argue that loss-of-function mutations play a substantial role in bacterial evolution, especially in adapting to extreme environments, and that understanding this can help us understand how bacteria adapt to chronic infections and how to culture bacteria in novel environments.
The paper proposes a computational model called Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) that attempts to map the mathematical equations of Bayesian belief propagation onto cortical circuits in the neocortex. The model suggests that the neocortex uses a hierarchical Bayesian model to learn and make predictions, with each node in the hierarchy learning spatial coincidences and then learning a mixture of Markov chains over those coincidences. The authors map the abstract neural implementation of the model onto actual cortical anatomy, showing how the nodes correspond to different regions of the cortex and microcircuits, and how the equations of belief propagation can be implemented in neurons. They demonstrate that the model can be used to model phenomena like the subjective contour effect, where humans perceive edges in areas where there is no direct visual evidence. However, the model does not fully capture all aspects of cortical circuits and the authors suggest that incorporating more details of the neocortex, like attention, learning mechanisms, and wiring length optimization, would be needed to improve the model. The authors believe that the merger of the theoretical model and anatomical constraints is non-trivial and instructive, and that the model provides a good starting point for a biologically grounded theory of the neocortex.
The paper describes a genetic screen to identify genes involved in hematopoiesis, the formation of blood cells, in zebrafish embryos. They found a mutation in the gene topoisomerase II binding protein 1 (TopBP1) that caused defects in the formation of blood cells. The mutant embryos had a reduced c-myb expression in the blood cells, indicating that the cells were not generated normally. The cells were found to have a defect in definitive hematopoies, which is the stage when blood cells are formed in the definitive hematopoietic tissue, but not in the early primitive hematopoies. The cells had a reduced proliferation in the definitive hematopoietic tissue, and the cells that were generated had increased apoptosis. The authors suggest that the loss of function of TopBP1 caused the defects in the blood cells by disrupting the DNA damage response pathway, leading to DNA damage and apoptosis. The findings suggest that TopBP1 plays an essential role in definitive hematopoies and that the DNA damage response pathway is important for the survival of blood cells during high proliferation stages.
The paper describes an experiment where researchers tested the effectiveness of the antibiotic levofloxacin in treating African green monkeys infected with the bacteria Yersinia pestis, which causes pneumonic plague. The researchers found that intravenous levofloxacin treatment initiated after the onset of fever in the monkeys (but before the animals became severely ill) significantly increased their chances of survival compared to monkeys that received a placebo treatment. All of the monkeys treated with levofloxacin survived to day 28 after exposure, while all of the monkeys that received a placebo died within 5 days. The study suggests that levofloxacin would likely be effective in treating bubonic plague, the less severe form of the disease, and could potentially be used as a treatment option in a bioterrorism event. However, more research is needed to determine the optimal dosing and timing of treatment.
This paper investigates how the bacterium Porphyromonas gingivalis can evade detection and clearance by immune cells. Porphyromonas gingivalis can survive within immune cells called dendritic cells by evading autophagy through a mechanism involving the receptor DC-SIGN. The bacteria express different fimbriae on their surface, which target different receptors on the immune cells. Engagement of the DC-SIGN receptor by the Mfa1 fimbria allows Porphyromonas gingis to evade autophagy and survive within immune cells. This evasion mechanism is distinct from the TLR2-mediated autophagy pathway used by the other fimbria. The results suggest that Porphyromonas gingis can survive within immune cells by regulating the expression of the DC-SIGN receptor and fimbria on its surface in response to environmental cues. This could contribute to the pathogenicity of the bacteria in chronic infections. The findings suggest that forcing autophagy in immune cells may be a potential therapeutic strategy to resolve chronic inflammatory diseases by activating a strong immune response.
The paper describes a genetic screen to identify genes involved in the production of cuticular hydrocarbons (pheromones) in Drosophila melanogaster. The researchers used RNA interference to knockdown the expression of genes known to be involved in the production of cuticular hydrocarbons and analyzed the resulting changes in the cuticle profiles by mass spectrometry. They found that 12 genes were involved in the production of cuticular hydrocarbons and identified a novel gene named spidey, which was found to regulate the production of ecdysteroids, a type of hormone that controls the production of cuticular hydrocarbons. When spidey was knocked down, the flies had defects in cuticle production, including a sticky phenotype where they were found dead on the walls of their vials instead of detaching. The loss of ecdysteroids during adulthood caused defects in stress resistance, lifespan and hydrophobicity. The researchers conclude that the production of ecdysteroids is needed throughout adulthood to maintain cuticle production and that environmental and physiological changes can modulate the production of cuticular hydrocarbons through the regulation of ecdysteroid levels. The findings suggest that the production of cuticular hydrocarbons is another trait that is subject to steroid control.
This paper studies how humans make decisions when faced with a task that requires planning ahead and making choices based on future outcomes. It presents a forced-choice decision-making task where participants were shown a visual stimulus consisting of disks of different sizes that they could touch to accumulate a score. The researchers analyzed how participants' choices compared to simulated "ideal" actors that could perform optimal computations. They found that humans behaved as if they had limited computational resources, trading off between having a deeper depth of computation (larger d) for less frequent recalculation (r) versus having a shallower d and recalculating more often. This resulted in a linear relationship between d and r, as expected. However, humans did not use simplifying heuristics like seeking the largest disks or avoiding the smallest disks. Instead, they took into account all information within their current depth of computation. This suggests that humans prioritize local computations and make decisions based on all relevant information, rather than relying on simplified heuristics. The study provides evidence that humans can perform complex prospective computations, but with limited computational resources, and highlights the trade-offs between depth of computation and recalculation frequency.
The paper describes a community-driven challenge called the Spikefinder challenge where researchers were asked to develop algorithms to infer spike rates from calcium imaging data. The challenge used five benchmark data sets consisting of recordings from 73 neurons in the primary visual cortex and retina of mice. Participants could submit their algorithms, which were then evaluated on the test data. The best performing algorithms improved the correlation between predicted and true spike traces by 40% compared to a baseline algorithm. The results showed that algorithms based on different principles, such as generative models and deep neural networks, yielded very similar performance, indicating that they all captured similar aspects of the spike-calcium relationship. This suggests that algorithms based on different principles can be effective for this task. The challenge demonstrates the potential of community-driven benchmarking in neuroscience to drive algorithm development and highlights the need for standardization of such algorithms. The authors conclude that more comprehensive data sets and new functional indicators may be needed to further improve spike rate inference.
The paper discusses how the bacteria Wolbachia pipientis, which is a maternally transmitted endosymbiont that infects insects, can reduce the infectivity of certain viruses like Dengue virus. They found that Wolbachia infection leads to increased expression of a gene called Mt2 which encodes a DNA/RNA methyltransferase. This gene appears to play a key role in Wolbachia's ability to inhibit virus infection by reducing viral RNA synthesis at an early stage. The study showed that Wolbachia infection leads to increased expression of Mt2 before virus infection and that loss of Mt2 results in increased virus titer. They also found that Mt2 overexpression in Wolbachia-infected flies resulted in reduced virus titer, suggesting that Mt2 is the mechanism underlying Wolbachia's antiviral effect. The paper suggests that Wolbachia may prime the host immune system and induce antiviral factors like Mt2 to inhibit virus replication. Further research is needed to understand the exact mechanism by which Mt2 modifies viral RNA and how this leads to reduced virus synthesis.
The researchers studied how the genes Fgf20 and Sox2 interact during development of the inner ear organ of Corti in the cochlea. They found that Fgf20 regulates Hey1 and Hey2 to prevent premature differentiation, while Sox2 regulates cell cycle exit and specification of the prosensory cells. They found that loss of Fgf20 leads to premature differentiation and loss of OHCs and SCs, while loss of Sox2 leads to delayed specification and loss of HCs and SCs. The researchers propose that Fgf20 and Sox2 interact to regulate a temporal buffer between specification and differentiation, with Fgf20 likely upstream of Sox2. The loss of Fgf20 and Sox2 leads to a shift in the temporal buffer, allowing premature differentiation in the basal end of the cochlea. The researchers also found that loss of Fgf20 does not affect Sox2 expression. The study suggests that the genetic interaction between Fgf20 and Sox2 regulates the development of all cells in the cochlea, with varying sensitivities.
The paper describes an open-source mobile app called VectorPoint that was developed to help health inspectors survey for Triatoma infestans, a parasite that causes Chagas disease in Arequipa, Peru. The app provides house-level infestation risk estimates based on data collected during a previous vector control campaign and new data collected during surveillance. Inspectors can use the app to select houses to inspect based on their infestation risk level. In a field study comparing the app to paper maps, the authors found that inspectors who used the app visited significantly more high-risk houses compared to those who used paper maps. Most inspectors showed some indication of incorporating the risk information into their decision-making, such as skipping lower risk houses and adjusting their movement patterns to target higher-risk houses. While the results are encouraging, the authors note that not all inspectors adopted the app equally and the app's usefulness may depend on factors like age and experience with technology. The authors suggest that the app could be useful in enhancing vector surveillance, but more research is needed to better understand how to motivate inspectors to use it and how to improve spatial coverage of surveillance.
The paper discusses how the initiation of DNA replication in cells is regulated to ensure that it occurs at specific sites and not undesired parts of the genome. The authors used a high-resolution mapping of DNA replication initiation sites in mouse embryonic stem cells to identify the locations of origins of replication (ori) and found that most oris associate with annotated transcriptional units and promoters, with CpG island promoters being the most efficient. They showed that the efficiency of replication initiation at these sites is strongly linked to transcription initiation, with promoter-oris being enriched in tags indicating early expression. This suggests that the initiation of both replication and transcription occur at the same sites, and that the state of chromatin conformation during transcription may influence the choice of replication initiation sites. They propose that promoters in germ cells and early embryonic cells recruit the pre-RC and establish a chromatin conformation that allows efficient replication initiation, which is then transmitted to somatic cells. This model could explain several observations in developmental systems.
This paper describes how the fungus Neurospora crassa uses a mechanism of "kind recognition" to distinguish between different types of cells. Kind recognition is a process where cells can distinguish between cells that are genetically different from each other, even when they are in close proximity. The fungus uses three genes called doc-1, doc-2, and doc-3 to determine communication group affiliation. These genes determine the communication group affiliation of genetically identical and non-identical cells. The doc-1, doc-2, and doc-3 genes are paralogous, meaning they have similar sequences but are found on different chromosomes. When cells with different doc genes are close to each other, they do not chemotropically interact, but when cells with the same doc gene interact, they can fuse together. The researchers found that the doc genes function by negatively regulating chemotropic interactions between cells to prevent self-stimulation. They propose that the doc genes may have a "education" function, where they help cells recognize unknown recognition components involved in the reinforcement of chemotropic signaling. This allows cells to coordinate behavior between genetically identical cells. The findings suggest that kind recognition is a complex mechanism that can occur at a distance, and may be common in filamentous fungi.
The paper discusses the genetic manipulation of Caenorhabditis elegans nematode worms to study the insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway and its role in life span extension. The researchers created mutants that have reduced or absent insulin/IGF-1 receptor activity and found that these worms have increased resistance to oxidative stress and extended life span. They found that the mutants have reduced protein kinase activity and transcript levels for genes involved in the insulin/IGF-1 pathway and related signaling pathways. They propose a "flip-flop" circuit where the insulin/IGF-1 pathway switches between activating and silencing the transcription factor DAF-16FOXO, which in turn regulates the kinase genes involved in the pathway. The reduced kinase activity and transcript levels in the mutants suggest that the DAF-16FOXO transcription factor is activated, silencing the kinases that would normally inhibit it. This results in a longevity state that promotes survival under harsh conditions. The mutants are infertile and appear normal in some aspects, but have extreme survival advantages, suggesting that the mechanisms that extend life are different from those that promote reproduction. The results provide insights into the genetic switches that control life span and may have implications for understanding insulin/IGF-1 signaling in mammals.
The paper describes how the parasite Leishmania donovani can develop resistance to different drug combinations used to treat Leishmaniasis. The researchers used a step-wise adaptation process to gradually increase the concentration of antimonials, paraformaldehyde, and miltefosine on the parasites, resulting in resistance. They found that different drug combinations induced different resistance profiles, with the combination of miltefosine and paraformaldehyde (MLF) inducing resistance most rapidly. Resistant parasites were also protected against the loss of ATP and mitochondrial membrane potential caused by the drugs. The researchers also found that intracellular amastigotes derived from resistant promastigotes had similar resistance profiles to the parental promastigotes, indicating that drug resistance is maintained in both forms. The results suggest that combination therapy may be effective against different Leishmania species, but optimal drug combinations must be optimized. The study provides evidence that Leishmania parasites have different ways of developing resistance to different drugs and may require different combination regimens for each species.
The paper discusses the mechanisms that contribute to cellular aging in human fibroblasts, specifically replicative senescence, which is the loss of cell division capacity due to DNA damage caused by shortening of telomeres. The authors found that mitochondrial dysfunction, including increased superoxide production, low mitochondrial membrane potential, and upregulation of uncoupling proteins, is associated with replicative senescence. They showed that these mitochondrial changes are linked to cell-to-cell variation in senescence, with cells that produce more superoxide and have lower membrane potential being more likely to enter senescence. They propose that this cell-to-cell variation is due to random fluctuations in mitochondrial ROS production, which in turn causes cell-to-cell variation in telomere shortening. The authors suggest that this mechanism of cellular aging through mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS production may be conserved across different species, from yeast to humans.
The paper discusses how inflammation in the pancreas can increase the risk of cancer by causing DNA damage and cell division. The authors created mice with a gene that detects DNA damage and cell division in the pancreas in order to study how inflammation and cell division interact to increase the risk of cancer. They found that inflammation causes DNA damage but cell division does not occur immediately. However, when cell division occurs at the same time as the inflammation, there is a synergy between the two that increases the risk of DNA damage leading to mutations. This synergy is seen when inflammation is repeated over multiple times, not just once. The authors suggest that chronic inflammation is more likely to cause mutations over isolated inflammation, as it can occur over a longer period of time. This suggests that people with chronic inflammatory conditions, such as inflammatory bowel diseases, may be more likely to develop cancer. They also found that exposure to chemotherapy drugs that damage DNA also increases mutations, particularly when cell division is occurring at the same time. This could help explain why cancer often recurs after treatment. The study highlights the importance of considering a person's physiological state when assessing cancer risk, particularly in the case of chronic inflammation and cell division.
The paper investigated the role of genetic polymorphisms in African trypanosomiasis, or sleeping sickness, a neglected disease endemic in Africa. The researchers looked at 17 genes and 96 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in northern Malawi, where the disease is most prevalent. They found that individuals with the APOL1 G2 variant were significantly less likely to get the disease, with a 7-fold reduction in susceptibility compared to those without the variant. This is consistent with previous studies in Uganda and Guinea that found a 5-fold reduction. However, there were discrepancies in the association between the G1 and G2 variants and different ethnic groups in the studies. The study suggests that genetic drift or specific selection may be responsible for the discrepancies. The findings support a role for genetic factors in controlling the severity of the disease. The study is the first in Malawi to find an association between the APOL1 G2 variant and resistance to African trypanosomiasis, adding to previous evidence that the variant reduces susceptibility.
The paper proposes a new algorithm called fastcore that can quickly and efficiently reconstruct a context-specific metabolic network from a genome-wide model. The key idea is to identify a subset of reactions that are active in the context of interest and then find a consistent subnetwork of the full model that contains all of these active reactions. This is done by iteratively maximizing a flux cardinality function that pushes all fluxes away from zero. This approach allows the algorithm to identify the consistent reactions in a single iteration, making it much faster than existing methods that involve iterative consistency testing. The authors show that the fastcore algorithm can be used to reconstruct context-specific models from a global model and core reactions, and that the resulting models are more compact than those obtained by existing methods. They also demonstrate that the fastcore reconstructions can capture functional information by simulating metabolic processes relevant to the context, like gluconeogenesis in the liver. Overall, the fastcore algorithm provides a practical way to quickly generate context-specific models that can capture biological redundancy and flexibility.
The paper describes a new approach to identifying genetic and environmental factors that influence human disease risk by analyzing gene expression patterns in peripheral blood. The researchers found that gene expression varies along specific axes or "axes" that are conserved across different studies and samples, even though the genetic backgrounds and environmental conditions differ. They identified 9 axes of gene expression variation that are highly correlated across different studies, and found that individuals with higher scores on these axes tend to have different health outcomes. They showed that these axes are enriched for genes involved in immune response and inflammation, and that individuals with higher scores on certain axes tend to have higher body mass index and biomarkers of inflammation. They also showed that these axes can be used as potential biomarkers for detecting changes in gene expression in individuals over time. Their findings suggest that the architecture of gene expression variation may be primed to promote disease responses and that healthy individuals vary along specific axes that predispose them to disease.
This paper explores how the structure of a network of populations distributed across space can affect the persistence of those populations. The authors model a system where a network of n patches is connected by dispersal links between them, and each patch has its own survival and fertility rates. They find that the network's connectivity, measured by the spectral radius of its adjacency matrix, determines the persistence of the metapopulation. More connected networks with fewer disconnected patches tend to have more populations that persist, while less connected networks tend to have more populations that go extinct. They show that the existence of cycles in the network, as well as the heterogeneity in connectivity, can enhance persistence. This framework provides new insights into how network structure affects the stability of metapopulations and has conservation implications for managing marine populations and designing networks of marine protected areas.
This paper discusses how the protein ZLD (Zinc Finger Early Drosophila Activator) controls the transition from a specified germ cell to a population of totipotent cells in the early stages of Drosophila development. ZLD is required for this transition, and the authors show that ZLD activity is precisely controlled through a conserved maternal-specific inhibitory domain. They generated mutations in this domain and found that loss or overexpression of this domain leads to lethality in the embryo. The authors propose that the early embryo is particularly sensitive to ZLD activity and that too little or too much is lethal. They also found that the second zinc finger domain of ZLD, which is the most highly conserved, is required for the maternal-specific lethality. They suggest that a cofactor that binds this domain and inhibits ZLD activity is only expressed in the early embryo, leading to the maternal-specific nature of the mutations. This cofactor likely interacts with ZLD within the early embryo, but not in later stages. The study demonstrates how precise regulation of ZLD activity is important for the rapid transition from maternal to zygotic control during early embryogenesis and how this transition requires coordinated regulation of both ZLD activation and degradation of maternal transcripts.
This paper describes the genetic and molecular mechanisms that allow the fungus Candida albicans to transition from a yeast form to a hyphal form. The researchers found that three proteins, Flo8, Mfg1, and Mss1, work together as a complex to regulate this transition, but they have different functions in the two species. In Candida albicans, the proteins are required for filamentation in response to different conditions, and there is less overlap in their functions compared to the related yeast species Saccharomyces cerevisiae. They identified a novel mechanism by which increasing the copy number of chromosome 6 can restore filamentation in mutants lacking the protein MFG1, suggesting that this is an adaptation that allows the fungus to transition to the hyphal form. They also found that overexpression of the protein FLO8 is sufficient to induce filamentation in the absence of MFG1, suggesting that FLO8 plays a key role in regulating this transition.
The paper describes a study on the mechanism of chromosome replication in the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. Vibrio cholerae has two chromosomes, one large and one small. The large chromosome, called Chr1, replicates earlier than the small chromosome, called Chr2. The replication of Chr2 depends on the replication of the large chromosome, called Chr1. The researchers found that doubling the copy number of a gene called crtS, which is involved in the replication of Chr2, is sufficient to trigger the replication of Chr2. This suggests that crtS has an activity that is independent of the actual act of replication. They propose that doubling the crtS gene copy number is sufficient to activate the crtS initiator protein, which is needed for Chr2 replication. This suggests that the passage of the replication fork over the crtS site may change its activity, rather than the actual replication of crtS. They also found that increasing the amount of the initiator protein RctB, which is required for Chr2 replication, can also overcome the need for crtS replication. The researchers conclude that the crtS gene has a remodeling activity that helps activate RctB, and that this activity is sufficient to trigger the replication of Chr2.
The paper reports on a study that found that people who were prescribed the proton pump inhibitor lansoprazole had a lower incidence of tuberculosis compared to those prescribed omeprazole or pantoprazole. The study used data from a large UK primary care database to compare new users of lansoprazole to new users of omeprazole or pantoprazole. The study found that after adjusting for other factors, people who were prescribed lansoprazole had a 68% lower incidence of tuberculosis compared to those prescribed omeprazole or pantoprazole. This association was found even after cessation of treatment and after adjusting for other factors. The results suggest that lansoprazole may have some clinical activity against tuberculosis, although the exact mechanism is not clear. The study did not find any association between lansoprazole use and negative outcomes like myocardial infarction or herpes zoster. The results provide evidence that lansoprazole may be a useful addition to current tuberculosis treatments, but more research is needed to determine its efficacy as a treatment.
This paper investigated the role of arginase activity in Leishmania parasites and its impact on disease progression in mice. Leishmania parasites have two forms of arginase, one expressed by the parasite and one by human macrophages. The parasite-expressed arginase is essential for parasite growth and survival inside macrophages, while the host-expressed arginase inhibits parasite growth. The paper found that pathogenic Leishmania parasites express higher levels of arginase in their promastigotes and in macrophages, which leads to higher arginase activity at the site of infection and in draining lymph nodes. In susceptible mice, high arginase activity correlates with non-healing lesions and uncontrolled parasite growth, while in resistant mice, arginase activity declines as the lesions heal. Infecting non-pathogenic Leishmania parasites did not induce arginase activity in macrophages or draining lymph nodes. The study suggests that arginase activity is a key factor in the outcome of cutaneous leishmaniasis in mice, and may be a target for vaccine development.
This paper introduces a new method called RNAcontext to model the binding preferences of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) based on their structural context. RNA context is a technique that represents each nucleotide in an RNA sequence based on its structural context, such as paired, unpaired, hairpin loop, or bulge. The authors use this annotation to train a motif model that considers multiple structural contexts simultaneously to capture the binding preferences of RBPs. They demonstrate that RNAcontext outperforms other motif finding methods in accurately predicting the binding affinity of RBPs to short RNA sequences, especially for RBPs with complex structural preferences. They show that the predicted binding preferences of RBPs match known from crystal structures and in vitro and in vivo data. They also show that the position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) representation of RNA binding preferences is a better approximation for RBPs than for DNA binding preferences of transcription factors. The paper concludes that the ability to model RBP binding preferences based on structural context represents an advance in the field and that the RNAcontext method can be expanded to incorporate new structural annotation schemes and improve RNA structure prediction methods.
The paper discusses research on identifying the cellular factors involved in the unusual cell entry pathway of Old World arenaviruses, which are particularly virulent viruses that cause hemorrhagic fevers. The researchers found that cell entry of Lassa virus and Lassa virus requires microtubules and phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3K activity. PI3K activity is required for efficient cell entry of Lassa virus and LCMV pseudotypes, but not for Vesicular stomatitis virus. They also found that Lassa virus and LCMV cell entry depends on a functional membrane lipid called lipid B, which is crucial for the formation of late endosomes. The researchers identified several cellular factors involved in this pathway, including the ESCRT proteins Hrs, Tsg101, Vps24, and Alix, as well as the ESCRT-associated protein Vps4. They showed that depletion of these factors significantly reduced cell entry of Lassa virus and LCMV pseudotypes, but not Vesicular stomatitis virus. They also showed that Lassa virus and LCMV pseudotypes cell entry into macrophage-like cells depends on microtubules and PI3K activity, but macrophage cell entry has a distinct pathway. The research provides a working model for the cell entry of Old World arenaviruses.
The paper summarizes the results of a systematic review of studies examining the relationship between socioeconomic position (SEP) and healthcare received in the last year of life. The review found that people with lower socioeconomic position (SEP) have higher odds of dying in hospitals and lower odds of receiving specialized end-of-life care, compared to those with higher SEP. The review included studies from high-income countries and found consistent evidence across multiple measures of SEP, including area deprivation, education, income, insurance, occupation, and housing. However, there were limitations in the studies, including observational nature, unmeasured confounding from illness and disease, and assumptions about preferable outcomes. The review recommends that future studies should account for socioeconomic position and aim to reduce social inequality in end-of-life care, particularly through targeted interventions that consider local populations and needs.
This paper describes a study on how African trypanosomes, which cause African sleeping sickness, regulate their growth and development in response to environmental cues. The authors used genetic techniques to identify genes involved in this process and determine the relationships between them. They created mutants that lacked certain genes involved in differentiation and then ectopically expressed those genes to restore differentiation in the mutants. By comparing the expression of different genes in the mutants, they were able to determine the relative position of the genes in the signaling pathway. The study found that differentiation is a complex process that involves multiple genes, and genes are involved in different parts of the pathway. Some genes act independently, while others are required in a sequential manner. The study also identified genes that inhibit differentiation and showed that some genes have multiple functions. The results suggest that differentiation is a complex process that involves multiple genes working together to regulate growth and development.
The paper discusses the question of how different proteins can bind to similar partners using different binding sites. The authors analyzed protein-protein complexes involving homologous proteins that bind to different partners to see if there is a pattern of similar binding sites between the proteins. They found that the binding sites of different proteins are not significantly similar, even when the homologous proteins have similar structures. This suggests that different proteins use their own unique binding strategies to recognize their partners. While there may be some conserved residues that play a role in the binding, the majority of the binding sites are not co-localized between the homologous proteins. Instead, different proteins use their own set of residues or groups of residues to interact with their partners. The authors propose that this could be due to the fact that the number of possible binding sites is limited, and proteins reuse common binding strategies. However, they were not able to confirm this hypothesis experimentally.
The researchers developed a new test called Chagas urine nanoparticle assay (Chunap) that uses nanoparticles to detect Trypanosoma cruzi antigens in urine. They found that the nanoparticles were able to capture and concentrate antigens from 90% of infected infants at one month of age, with a detection limit of 0.5 ng/ml. This was more sensitive than microscopy or PCR at one month. The nanoparticles were also able to protect antigens from enzymatic degradation. They tested different types of antigens including proteins, glycoproteins and lipophosphoglycan. The non-invasive nature of the test makes it easier for parents to collect urine samples. They hope to adapt the test for use in resource-limited settings to enable early diagnosis of congenital Chagas disease.
The paper describes how the authors identified a gene, Drip, that affects fecundity in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. They found that a genetic variation in the Drip gene is responsible for natural variation in fecundity in a population of flies. They identified a genomic region containing 5 genes that affects fecundity and mapped the causative polymorphism to a 3 LOD interval on chromosome 2R. They showed that expression of the Drip gene in neurons in the brain affects fecundity. They found that low fecundity flies have lower expression of the corazonin gene, which may contribute to increased stress resistance and activity. The authors propose that natural polymorphisms in the Drip gene may be subject to balancing selection because it modulates the physiological basis for environmentally dependent life-history trade-offs. The study suggests that genetic variation in Drip affecting fecundity may be subject to selection because it affects the physiological basis for environmentally dependent life-history trade-offs.
The paper describes how a bacteriophage called ΦTE evolved a mechanism to escape the host's Abi (abortive infection) defense system by producing an inactive antitoxin RNA that mimics the host's ToxIN toxin. The ΦTE genome contains a repeat of the ToxI antitoxin RNA, which is expanded from 1.5 repeats in the wild type to 4.5 repeats in the escape phages. The expanded repeats are sufficient to allow the host to express active pseudo-ToxI RNAs that can fold properly and interact with the host's ToxN protein to suppress Abi activity. This escape mechanism is different from other known mechanisms of phage escape that involve point mutations or large genome rearrangements. The study demonstrates that ΦTE can transfer the ToxIN plasmid through phage-mediated transfer, providing a new example of "infectious altruism" where the phage acts to benefit the host. The paper also shows that the expanded antitoxin locus can be generated through strand slippage during replication. This mechanism of escape may be common in phages and could explain why some phages are able to escape Abi systems. The findings provide insights into the evolution of phage-host interactions and mechanisms of defense and counter-attack.
This paper describes a new experimental system for studying cell-to-cell transmission of retroviruses like HIV and HTLV-1. The authors constructed retroviral vectors that allow them to quantify the transmission of virus between cells. They showed that cell-to-cell transmission is the dominant mechanism of transmission for HTLV-1, while cell-free transmission predominates for HIV-1. They also found that the HTLV-1 Tax protein plays a key role in enhancing the efficiency of cell-to-cell transmission. The system described in this paper will allow them to further study the mechanisms of cell-to-cell transmission and identify the cellular factors involved. The authors believe that this system will be useful for understanding how retroviruses transmit between cells in vivo.
The paper describes the first core gene regulatory network (GRN) for the zebrafish iridophore, a type of pigment cell that generates different types of pigment cells. The researchers used a combination of experimental genetics and mathematical modeling to identify the key genes involved in iridophore specification and development. They found that the Tfec/Ltk positive feedback loop is a key component of the GRN, with Sox10 function being required for maintenance of Tfec expression in iridoblasts. They also identified a factor R that represses Mitfa expression in iridophores, which they propose to be Foxd3. The study highlights the complexity of gene repression during pigment cell development and the need to better understand how factors repressing melanocyte fate in iridophores. The researchers propose that there may be two subpopulations of iridophores, with Foxd3 only expressed in a subset of cells. The work provides a basis for integrating the GRNs of melanocytes and iridophores, and aims to decode the mechanism repressing melanocyte fate in the iridophore lineage.
The paper discusses the interaction between a plant protein called RB and two different effector proteins called IPI-O1 and IPI-O4 from the potato pathogen Phytophthora infestans. RB recognizes the presence of IPI-O1 and IPI-O4 and elicits a defense response, while IPI-O4 also suppresses the RB-mediated defense response. The researchers identified specific amino acids within IPI-O4 that are important for its interaction with RB and its ability to suppress the defense response. They found that IPI-O4 interacts with the RB CC domain, which is necessary for RB activation. They propose a model where IPI-O4 prevents RB from oligomerizing into a signaling complex, which inhibits its ability to elicit the defense response. They also identified a double mutation in IPI-O4 that regains its ability to interact with RB and elicit the defense response. The findings suggest that the interaction between IPI-O4 and RB's CC domain is important for the suppression of RB-mediated defense. The study provides insights into the molecular mechanisms that allow Phytophthora infestans to overcome resistance genes and could inform the design of new resistance genes that can effectively control disease.
The paper discusses how mutations in protein kinases can lead to cancer by shifting the equilibrium between active and inactive conformations of the protein. The authors used molecular dynamics simulations and molecular mechanics simulations to study how activating mutations in ABL and EGFR kinases lead to conformational changes that enhance the stability of the active kinase form. They found that activating mutations tend to destabilize the inactive kinase form and enhance the stability of the active kinase form. This may lead to increased activity of the active kinase, which in turn can contribute to cancer. The paper suggests that understanding the conformational changes and molecular mechanisms of activating mutations in kinases could help identify potential drug targets for cancer therapy. The authors propose a multi-stage activation mechanism involving cooperative transitions between different kinase conformations, where structural elements like the hydrophobic spine and salt bridges play a key role in shifting the equilibrium towards the active kinase form. The study provides insights into how activating mutations in kinases can contribute to cancer and may be targeted for therapy.
The paper discusses how a two-step algorithm using a cutoff of 5-50 leucocytes/ul at 6 months can accurately predict relapse in patients treated for African trypanosomiasis. The algorithm was tested on a large dataset of 2100 patients and found to have a high specificity and sensitivity, correctly identifying relapsed patients with a low misclassification rate. This allows for a shorter follow-up period and can help reduce the burden of follow-up for patients. However, the cutoff value is not perfect and some patients may be misclassified as cured. The authors recommend that patients who are classified as cured early using the algorithm should be encouraged to come for follow-up if symptoms reappear later to confirm their status. The study demonstrates the value of using the CSF leucocyte count to predict treatment efficacy, but acknowledges that the data is collected from routine programs and has limitations.
The paper discusses how hypoxia, which occurs in tumors as they grow, can trigger the reactivation of Epstein-Barrus virus (EBV) from a latent to a lytic phase. The researchers found that hypoxia induces a protein called HIF-1alpha, which in turn activates the BZLF1 gene, leading to EBV reactivation. They identified a specific HRE element within the BZP gene that HIF-1alpha binds to and activate transcription from. They showed that HIF-1alpha is the predominant HIF-1alpha expressed in EBV-infected cells. They propose that hypoxia in EBV-infected tumors leads to the accumulation of HIF-1alpha, which then reactivates EBV through the BZLF1 gene, contributing to tumorigenesis. They identified drugs that can rapidly and efficiently induce EBV lytic gene expression, possibly by stabilizing HIF-1alpha, as a potential cancer therapy.
This paper presents a new model for understanding how the shape of dendrites in neurons is optimized to maximize the transmission of synaptic inputs. The authors find that the optimal shape of dendrites is a quadratic taper, which allows for the most efficient transmission of synaptic current to the soma. They show that dendrites with this shape are more similar to realistic shapes observed experimentally. They also show that dendrites with this shape have better voltage profiles and current transfer compared to dendrites with constant radii. They demonstrate this for several different types of neurons and find that the model provides a good fit to a range of dendritic morphologies. The authors propose an algorithm to map the optimal taper onto complex branched dendrites, but note that this is beyond the scope of their current study. The paper highlights how the simple form of the voltage and optimal radius profiles provide a new intuition into how dendrites function.
The paper describes a study that tested the effectiveness of a new typhoid vaccine called M01Z09 in preventing typhoid infection in healthy volunteers who were deliberately infected with Salmonella Typhi bacteria. The vaccine was given as a single dose 28 days before being infected with the bacteria. While the vaccine did not show significant protection against typhoid infection in the study, it did delay the onset and severity of symptoms, reduce the bacterial load and shedding of the bacteria. The study found that low levels of anti-Vi IgG antibodies, which are produced in response to the vaccine, may be protective against typhoid infection. The study demonstrates the utility of using human challenge studies to evaluate the efficacy of new vaccines, but notes that the results may be an underestimate of the actual effectiveness in real-world settings due to differences in background exposure and antigen durability. The study shows that a single dose of M01Z09 may provide up to 50% protection and could potentially be used as a public health control strategy to reduce the risk of infection.
The paper discusses a randomized controlled trial that compared the effectiveness of two different malaria prevention regimens during pregnancy and infancy. Pregnant women were randomized to receive either sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) every 8 weeks, dihydroartin-piperaquine (DP) every 8 weeks, or DP every 4 weeks during pregnancy and infancy. The study found that children born to mothers who received DP every 4 weeks had a higher risk of malaria during infancy, especially female children. This was observed even though all children received the same dose of DP in infancy. The study suggests that consistent in-utero exposure to DP may lead to sex-specific differences in drug metabolism, with lower drug levels in female infants. The findings suggest that in-utero exposure to DP may not reduce the risk of malaria in infancy as previously thought, and that different drug dosing strategies may be needed for male and female infants. Further research is needed to understand the biological mechanisms and how this may impact treatment and prevention strategies.
The paper discusses the impact of climate change on HIV infection in Lesotho, particularly among young women. The study found that during a severe drought in 2014-2016, households in rural areas were more likely to be poor and food insecure, and young women were more likely to engage in risky sexual behaviors such as transactional sex and early marriage. This increased their likelihood of HIV infection. Men were more likely to migrate, which may also increase their risk of infection. The study suggests that droughts have negative income shocks and food insecurity can increase the risk of HIV transmission among young women, while men may be protected by reduced access to commercial sex work and migration. The study highlights the need for targeted interventions to minimize the impact of drought on HIV infection, particularly among young women, including cash transfers to keep children in school and avoid early marriage, programs for sex workers, and expanded programs for migrants. The study emphasizes the importance of addressing the myriad factors contributing to vulnerability and improving resilience of crops to mitigate the impact of drought on household incomes and public health.
The paper describes a method for comparing two different states of gene expression data, such as young and old mice, by analyzing the correlation between genes rather than just looking at changes in gene expression levels. By comparing the correlation between genes, they found that gene expression networks in old mice show a decrease in correlation compared to young mice. They identified several possible mechanisms that could account for this loss of correlation, including deterioration of transcription factor activity and chromatin structure. They found that genes that lose correlation with other genes in old age tend to be clustered together on the chromosome. This suggests that specific chromatin domains may be affected by aging. The method is useful for comparing different states of gene expression, not just changes in gene expression levels, and could be applied to other biological networks as well as social or economic networks.
The paper describes an analysis of the evolution of Myxoma virus (MYXV), a poxvirus that causes myxomatosis in European rabbits. The virus has been studied extensively in Australia, where it evolved from a mild, localized cutaneous infection to a highly virulent, lethal disease. The virus was then introduced to Europe, where it spread and evolved into different strains, some of which caused a distinct "amyxomatous" phenotype with few or no cutaneous lesions. The authors analyzed the genomes of 21 MYXV isolates from Scotland and England to determine how the virus has evolved and how it affects rabbit hosts. They found that different strains have distinct virulence genes and disease phenotypes, with some strains causing acute collapse and others causing nodular cutaneous or myxomatous disease. They also found that the genetic changes in the virus have led to changes in the disease pathogenesis, allowing it to infect rabbits in different ways. The results suggest that evolutionary success of the virus has come from multiple pathways, leading to different disease types and virulence. The study shows that the virus has explored many evolutionary pathways to achieve its current virulence, and that changes in the virus and host genetics interact to produce the distinct disease phenotypes seen in the field.
The paper discusses how a protein called bZIP1 helps plants regulate their growth in response to energy deprivation. When plants are deprived of energy, bZIP1 is activated and represses the expression of certain genes that control auxin transport and root growth. This results in impaired auxin transport to the root tip, leading to reduced root growth. The study found that bZIP1 expression is controlled by the low energy activated SnRK1 kinases and is induced by energy deprivation. The bZIP1-related factors are part of a network that integrates energy signaling into auxin-mediated root growth control. The study used genetic and biochemical approaches to show that bZIP1 expression represses the expression of a key auxin transport gene called IAA3SHY2, which in turn represses PIN3 and PIN1 expression. This leads to impaired auxin transport and reduced root growth. The study suggests that bZIP1 acts as a central energy sensor that helps plants balance their energy inputs into their growth processes.
The paper discusses a study on the accuracy of the new World Health Organization (WHO) classification of dengue fever into severe and non-severe cases. The study found that both the old and new classifications had low sensitivity in identifying patients who needed advanced level of care, with only hemoconcentration with concurrent drop in platelet count being a significant predictor of severe outcomes. The authors propose two new criteria to improve the sensitivity of the new classification: acute decompensation of chronic diseases and evidence of minor bleeding in association with thrombocytopenia <20,00 platelets/mm3. Adding these criteria improved sensitivity to identify patients who needed level III care without significantly altering specificity. They argue that a more sensitive classification is needed to capture severe cases and direct patient management in the right level of care to reduce morbidity and mortality. However, the study has limitations due to retrospective design and incomplete observations. Further prospective studies in multiple regions and countries are needed to confirm the findings and improve the classification.
The paper describes a new mechanism by which the BMP signaling pathway regulates the development and function of synapses. It is found that the BMP receptor Saxophone (Sax) and the BMP receptor type II receptor Wit (BMPRII) accumulate at synaptic terminals and interact with the BMP ligand Mad to phosphorylate Mad. This local accumulation of Mad at synaptic terminals is found to be independent of the BMP receptor Gbb and the BMP ligand BMPRII. The local accumulation of Mad at synapses is required for the stabilization of the active type-A receptors at synaptic sites, which in turn promotes the accumulation of BMPRII at the synaptic terminals. This positive feedback loop helps maintain the activity of the type-A receptors at synaptic sites. The authors propose that the local accumulation of Mad at synaptic terminals acts as a sensor for the activity of the postsynaptic GluRIIA receptors, allowing the BMP signaling pathway to regulate the distribution of type-A receptors at the synapse. This novel noncanonical BMP pathway does not contribute to the growth of the neuronal synapse but instead modulates the distribution of type-A receptors at the synapse.
The paper describes how the bacteria Listeria monocytogenes, a pathogen that causes listeriosis, senses and regulates its growth and virulence based on the availability of branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) in its environment. The bacteria has a regulatory mechanism whereby it produces a protein called Rli60 that senses BCAAs and restricts their production when BCAAs are low. This allows the bacteria to maintain a low concentration of BCAAs within the host cells it infects, which in turn allows the bacteria's virulence factors to be regulated by a protein called CodY. The study shows that this mechanism is important for the bacteria's ability to infect hosts and cause disease. The bacteria's ability to control its BCA production in this way is an adaptation that allows it to better survive within the host. The findings provide evidence that bacteria's metabolism and virulence are closely linked and highlight the importance of understanding how bacteria regulate their metabolism during infection.
The paper describes the sequencing and assembly of the turkey genome using a combination of Roche 454 and Illumina GII sequencing technologies. The turkey genome was sequenced from a female bird, Nici, which had some degree of inbreeding. The resulting sequence was assembled using Celera Assembler and compared to the chicken genome. The turkey genome was found to have 80 chromosomes, similar to the chicken genome, but with some differences in chromosome rearrangements. The turkey genome had higher nucleotide diversity on the smaller chromosomes and lower nucleotide diversity on the larger ones. The assembly was used to identify genes that had undergone accelerated evolution, which were found to be involved in transcriptional regulation and protein turnover. The innate immune system genes were found to have lower dN/dS ratios compared to other genes. The repeat content of the turkey and chicken genomes was similar, indicating stable genomes. The turkey genome was used to study the evolutionary relationships between birds and mammals and to identify genes that have undergone gene loss and gain. The paper demonstrates that whole genome sequencing at a lower cost and with high throughput can be used to compare genomes and identify genes with accelerated evolution.
The paper discusses a mathematical model to describe how a complex virus-like particle called a rotavirus VLP is assembled from three layers of proteins. The model is based on the principles of thermodynamic equilibrium and hierarchical assembly, where each layer is built from the most stable intermediate structures according to thermodynamics. The authors analyze experimental data on the assembly and disassembly of VLPs to determine the factors that influence the efficiency of assembly and disassembly. They find that the assembly efficiency of the VLPs depends on the concentration of proteins, temperature, pH, and ions, and that at low concentrations of protein, the VLPs are maximally assembled. At higher concentrations, the assembly efficiency decreases as the VLPs are no longer maximally assembled. The model provides insights into how to optimize the conditions for in vitro production of VLPs, which could help transition from lab-scale to large-scale production.
The paper discusses the role of the protein FliZ in the bacterium Xenorhabdus nematophila, which is a complex surface structure that allows the bacteria to move and infect insects. The authors found that the protein FliZ regulates the expression of flagellar genes, which are essential for bacterial motility and virulence. They used RNA sequencing to compare the gene expression profiles of the wild type and a mutant lacking the FliZ protein and found that the mutant had reduced flagellin expression, resulting in weaker motility. The FliZ protein also regulates expression of non-flagellar genes involved in bacterial virulence. The authors propose that FliZ acts as a positive feedback loop that fine-tunes the bimodal expression of flagellar genes, allowing some cells to produce flagella while others do not. This bimodal expression may allow the bacteria to generate different subpopulations of cells with different virulence potentials, which could help the bacteria adapt to different environments. The study suggests that the bacteria may generate a mixed population of cells, some of which produce flagella and others do not, which could be advantageous for in different invertebrate niches.
The paper proposes a mathematical model to study how information about novel behaviors spreads between animal populations. The model describes how individuals learn behaviors from each other through social transmission and also how they move between different spatial sub-populations. The authors find that conformity in learning, where individuals tend to copy the most common behavior, is important for the emergence of local traditions or unique behaviors within a population. They show that when movement rates are low compared to the strength of conformity, local traditions are more likely to emerge. They also find that the spatial configuration of sub-populations affects which behavior ultimately dominates, with larger sub-populations tending to dominate. The model can make predictions about conditions under which local traditions are likely to emerge in different populations, such as the effect of fragmentation and the initial size of sub-populations. The authors argue that their model highlights the importance of both social learning and movement in determining the spread of information and the emergence of animal cultures.
The paper describes the isolation of a human antibody (P1F12) from a patient who had a Zika virus infection and developed Guillain-Barré syndrome, a neurological disorder. The antibody was found to have no detectable mutations in its genes, yet it was able to neutralize Zika virus and bind to an immunodominant epitope. This suggests that germline-encoded antibodies can be generated without extensive affinity maturation through the germinal center response. The authors conclude that this antibody, which lacks detectable affinity maturation, may have developed without the affinity maturation process, likely through a rapid germline-dependent pathway. The findings suggest that affinity maturation is not necessary for the generation of virus-neutralizing antibodies, and that germline-encoded antibodies can neutralize viruses.
The paper discusses the use of molecular diagnostic methods, including PCR and qRT-PCR, to detect and quantify the number of Trypanosoma cruzi parasites in the blood of patients with Chagas disease who are infected with HIV. The researchers found that the PCR method was more sensitive and efficient, detecting parasitemia in patients with HIV infection and reactivation, while the qRT-PCR method was more specific and able to distinguish between patients with and without Chagas disease reactivation. However, the PCR method was more labor-intensive and required more DNA and post-PCR processing. The researchers suggest that monitoring the levels of parasitemia in patients with HIV infection could help identify those who might benefit from pre-emptive therapy, as higher levels of parasitemia were found in patients with reactivation and lower CD4+ cell counts. The study demonstrates the utility of molecular methods for diagnosing and monitoring Chagas disease in patients with HIV infection and immunosuppression, and highlights the need for prospective studies to better understand the factors that influence Chagas disease reactivation in these patients.
The paper discusses the advantages and disadvantages of different methods for detecting positive and negative results in LAMP (Loop-mediated isothermal amplification) assays for detecting African trypanosomiasis. The most promising methods are those that change color visually, either by turbidity or metal ion indicators. However, the agreement between observers was found to be imperfect, especially for the color change methods. Hydroxynaphthol blue was found to be the most reliable and easy to see, while calcein and MnCl2 were difficult. The study shows that visible turbidity is not possible for all LAMP assays, and opening the reaction tube for color change methods exposes the laboratory to contamination. The most cost-effective methods were calcein and MnCl2, but the color change was difficult to see and inconsistent among observers. The paper concludes that hydroxynaphthol blue is the best method for easy, inexpensive and reliable color change detection, but more work is needed to improve the consistency of observer interpretations.
The paper describes a computational model of a cortical column based on the Potjans and Diesmann model. The authors used a population-level statistical approach to simulate the dynamics of the neurons in the model and found that the model can perform a subtractive computation between two input streams, comparing the difference in the mean activity of the output layer 5. They found that balanced target specificity resulted in linear responses while selective targeting of a particular cell type led to nonlinear interactions. The authors speculate that this subtractive computation could represent an error signal between reality and expectation, which could be used for valuation and reward prediction. The model's ability to perform a subtractive computation without assuming any specific underlying computation suggests that cortical layers may be performing a form of Bayesian filtering. The results of the simulations are in line with the hierarchical predictive coding model and provide a good match to experimental findings, suggesting that the cortical layers may be organized in a hierarchical manner for valuation and prediction.
The paper argues that the dN/dS ratio, which is commonly used to quantify selection pressure on protein-coding regions, has different properties when applied to samples from a single population compared to samples from divergent species. When comparing samples from different species, the dN/dS ratio can be used to infer the strength of selection, with dN/dS values less than 1 indicating negative selection and dN/dS values greater than 1 indicating positive selection. However, this simple interpretation does not apply when comparing samples from a single population. Within a population, the dN/dS ratio is less sensitive to selection pressure, does not increase monotonically with the strength of selection, and can even indicate weak or strong positive selection depending on the specific mutation rate. This means that when applying dN/dS to intra-specific samples, the results may be misleading and inferences about selection pressure cannot be relied upon. The paper highlights this difference and its implications for studies of microbial and viral evolution, where intra-specific comparisons are common.
The paper discusses the role of intrinsic T cell receptor signaling in CD8 T cell responses against fungal infections. The authors found that T cell intrinsic MyD8 signals, which are required for T cell activation and proliferation, are particularly important for the development of anti-fungal T cell responses. Intrinsic MyD8 signals, such as TLR2 and IL-1R signals, are required for the expansion of Tc17 cells, but not Tc1 cells, after fungal vaccination. This is because Tc17 cells require more proliferation and survival to become long-lasting memory cells. The authors found that MyD8 signals through Akt1 and mTOR to enhance Tc17 cell proliferation, but not Tc1 cell proliferation. They also found that the absence of MyD8 signals leads to impaired Tc17 cell responses and increased susceptibility to fungal infections. The study highlights the importance of identifying targets for enhancing adaptive immunity against fungal infections in individuals with CD4+ T cell defects, which could be useful for designing vaccines and immunotherapy against fungal infections.
The paper describes a new approach for classifying enzymes based on short sequences called "spatial peptides" (SPs) found on their protein sequences. The SPs are found using an unsupervised algorithm called MEX, which is based on analyzing the probability of amino acid sequences following certain paths in a graph. The SPs are then used to classify enzymes into their corresponding EC (enzyme commission) functional categories. The approach achieves high accuracy, with 93% of enzymes being correctly classified based on the SPs, and only 8% of SPs being wrongly classified. The SPs are found to cover a large fraction of known active and binding sites on enzymes, indicating they are important functional markers. The approach is more accurate than comparing enzyme sequences based on similarity, and achieves higher coverage of active sites compared to existing motif databases. The SPs are found to be of biological significance even when there is low sequence similarity between enzymes. The paper demonstrates that SPs can be useful for functional classification and may be used as an additional tool for understanding the biological roles of enzymes.
The paper discusses how the Wnt signaling pathway in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans contributes to the patterning of embryonic divisions. The authors show that the Wnt pathway is active in most embryonic divisions and leads to the establishment of an anterior-posterior asymmetry in β-catenin levels, which in turn influences the expression of target genes. They find that cells that express Wnt ligands have higher nuclear β-catenin levels compared to cells that do not express Wnt ligands, and that cells that have higher nuclear β-catenin levels tend to have lower POP-1 levels. This results in a quantitative difference in POP-1 activity between sister cells, which is transmitted to their descendants. This cousin enrichment of β-catenin levels and POP-1 activity is found to be cell-autonomous and is mediated by the proteasome. The authors propose a model where POP-1 activity depends on a threshold of β-catenin and POP-1 concentrations, with the threshold varying by lineage. This leads to the activation of some genes in posterior lineages and repression in anterior lineages. The study shows that genes expressed in posterior lineages tend to depend on POP-1 for activation, while genes expressed in anterior lineages require POP-1 for repression. The findings suggest that quantitative differences in β-catenin localization and POP-1 activity contribute to context-specific gene regulation in the embryo.
This paper describes the use of a new model organism, Plasmodium knowlesi, to study the genes associated with drug resistance in Plasmodium vivax. The researchers used this model to express genes from P. vivax and study their impact on drug susceptibility. They generated 14 lines expressing P. vivax proteins and found that the proteins were trafficked to the correct organelles, such as the food vacuole membrane, cytosol and mitochondria, as predicted by their homologous proteins in Plasmodium falciparum. However, they did not find any evidence that the expressed P. vivax genes led to increased drug resistance in the P. knowi parasites, suggesting that the genes may not play a role in resistance to chloroquine or mefloquine. The study shows that P. knowi can be used as an in vitro model to study P. vivax genes and could potentially provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of drug resistance. The authors note that while the results suggest the genes do not contribute to resistance, there are several technical limitations to the study, including the fact that the isolates used to generate the transfection constructs were not tested for resistance and that the genes were expressed from a wild-type P. knowi background. Further advances in P. knowi tools, such as CRISPR/Cas9, could allow for more precise studies of drug resistance in P. vivax.
This paper aims to estimate the burden of zoonotic diseases (diseases that are naturally transmissible between animals and humans) in Kyrgyzstan. Zoonoses are an increasing problem in low income countries where healthcare and sanitation are poor. The authors use a standardized method called Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALY) to calculate the burden of disease. They found that 43 zoonotic diseases were quantifiable in Kyrgyzstan in 2013, including anthrax, brucellosis, campylobiosis, congenital toxoplasmosis, non-typhoidal salmonellosis, and rabies. The majority of the burden comes from premature deaths due to infections, which accounts for 67-10% of the total burden. The majority of deaths come from salmonellosis and invasive non-typhoidal salmonellosis. The estimated 35,209 DALYs in 2013 is less than the burden of HIV in Kyrgyzstan, but the majority (43%) is caused by echinococococcosis (both AE and CE). The authors note that the lack of data and the conservative assumptions used in their modeling mean that the true burden is likely higher. The study provides an estimate of the zoonotic disease burden in Kyrgyzstan and highlights the importance of collecting more data to prioritize healthcare needs.
This paper discusses how the liver can function as an alternative site for immune cell priming and activation when the lymph nodes are absent or defective. The authors demonstrate this by showing that mice lacking lymph nodes (lymphoid tissue) can still develop immune responses, including autoimmune disease, through the liver. They show that liver-resident immune cells, including dendritic cells and T cells, can take up antigen from the site of immunization and present it to other immune cells, leading to the accumulation of immune cells in the liver. The liver is found to be a good alternative site for priming and activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, even in the absence of lymph nodes. This suggests that the liver has the potential to "remember" its lymphoid function and can function as an immune organ, even though it lacks the specialized lymphoid tissues. The findings have implications for understanding adaptive immunity and vaccination, as well as how immune diseases develop.
This paper explores how fluctuations in membrane voltage can modulate the input-output responses of stellate cells in the medial entorhinal cortex. The authors found that while stellate cells exhibit some degree of fluctuation-mediated modulation of input-output responses, the effect is relatively small compared to what has been observed in other neuron types. They identified two key factors that determine how much fluctuations can modulate input-output responses: the voltage-dependent slope of the membrane resistance over a large sub-threshold voltage range, and the activation of negative slope conductance that slows the voltage trajectory near spike threshold. The authors used a simplified model of spiking dynamics and experiments to investigate how these factors influence the relationship between voltage fluctuations and input-output modulation. They found that a larger slope conductance and a shallow voltage-voltage relationship limit the ability of fluctuations to modulate input-output responses, while a larger voltage trajectory that spends more time near spike threshold allows fluctuations to have a greater impact. These findings suggest that the low degree of fluctuation-mediated modulation observed in stellate cells may be advantageous for maintaining stable firing patterns and reliability of inputs related to relevant network activity.
The paper discusses how a protein called BacA helps bacteria called Sinorhizobium meliloti form symbiotic relationships with legume plants like Medicago truncatula. When the bacteria enter the plant cells, they differentiate into nitrogen-fixing bacteria called bacteroids. The protein BacA protects the bacteria from antimicrobial peptides produced by the plant, called nodule-specific cysteine-rich peptides (NCRs), which are important for the bacteria to differentiate into bacteroids. The study shows that BacA is essential for the bacteria to survive within the plant cells and form bacteroids, but not necessary for the bacteroids to be formed in legume species that naturally produce NCRs. The authors propose that BacA protects the bacteria by reducing the damage to their cytoplasmic membrane caused by NCRs, allowing them to differentiate into bacteroids. The findings suggest that BacA plays a key role in the bacteria's ability to form prolonged intracellular infections.
This paper discusses how Helicobacter pylori, a bacteria that commonly causes stomach ulcers and cancer, can change its virulence in response to its host environment. The bacteria has a protein called cagY that helps it infect the stomach. The cagY protein has many repeated sequences that can rearrange itself, which allows it to change how it functions. The bacteria can either lose or gain function in this protein, depending on how the host immune system responds. The bacteria can then select for variants of the protein that either induce more or less inflammation. The authors propose that the cagY protein acts like a "molecular switch" that allows the bacteria to adapt to different hosts and maximize its ability to infect. The bacteria can lose function to reduce inflammation, or gain function to increase inflammation. This allows it to infect hosts that would otherwise reject it.
This paper explores the relationship between gene expression noise and the sequence features associated with translational efficiency. The authors measured gene expression noise in a large set of genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and found that genes with high codon usage and low 5' UTR secondary structure tend to have higher noise levels. They also found that genes with a TATA box in the promoter region tend to have higher noise levels compared to genes without one. To quantitatively assess the relative contributions of transcriptional and translational noise, they developed an approach to decompose gene expression noise into noise amplified by the TATA box and noise amplified by high codon usage. They found that the amplification of noise due to high codon usage is comparable to the amplification due to a TATA box, suggesting that these two factors have similar impacts on gene expression noise. This suggests that both transcriptional and translational noise contribute to gene expression heterogeneity, but in different ways. The results provide an initial estimate of the relative impact of these factors and demonstrate a general approach for measuring the interplay between them.
This paper studies the role of catalase in the fungal pathogen Candida albicans. It shows that high levels of catalase at the time of stress imposition promote resistance to oxidative and combinatorial stress, which is consistent with previous studies. However, it also finds that high basal levels of catalase expression actually decrease the fitness of C. albicans cells in the absence of stress, suggesting that this protective effect comes at a cost. The study also finds that high basal catalase expression increases the fungus's demand for iron, which may contribute to this fitness defect. This suggests that the double-edged sword of high basal catalase levels, which protects against stress while increasing iron demand, likely accounts for the apparent counterintuitive observation that catalase overexpression decreases colonization in some tissues. The study provides insights into the role of catalase levels in the virulence of C. albicans, showing that high basal expression confers a fitness defect that may be overcome by iron supplementation.
The paper examines the genetic diversity of Schistosoma japonicum, a parasite that causes schistosomiasis in the Philippines, to determine if it can explain the variations in disease prevalence and transmission across different endemic areas. The researchers found that the genetic diversity of S. japonic is high within each endemic area but low among areas, indicating that there is ongoing gene flow between the populations. This suggests that migrations and movement of infected hosts from one area to another contribute to the spread of alleles that may be responsible for the high infection rates. They found that the genetic diversity within Catarman, where there is high prevalence of in humans and snail intermediate hosts, is likely due to low inbreeding and the presence of multiple genotypes. The genetic diversity in New Corella, where there is high prevalence of in humans but low inbreeding, may be due to spatial isolation. The study suggests that genetic diversity is important in the parasite's ability to survive drug treatment and that regular monitoring of genetic changes in the parasite populations can help improve control programs. The researchers recommend using additional polymorphic microsatellite markers to study the genetic diversity of S. japonic, S. mansoni and S. haematobium to improve their analysis.
The paper describes a case of hybrid necrosis in Arabidopsis thaliana, where three different pairs of alleles at a conventional disease resistance gene (RPP7) and alleles at a non-disease resistance gene (RPW8/HR) interact to trigger autoimmunity in the absence of pathogens. The authors find that within the immune system, certain pairs of loci are more likely to misbehave than others. They show that genes of the RPW8/HR cluster can confer broad-spectrum disease resistance while at least one RPP7 member can confer race-specific resistance, providing a link between different arms of the plant immune system. They also find that the number of repeats in the RP8/HR genes, specifically the C-terminal tail, is a key factor in determining the severity of the hybrid necrosis phenotype. The results suggest that certain loci within the immune system interact in a predictable manner, and that the RP8/HR genes may form a pores or pore-like structure that can be regulated by pathogen effectors.
The paper describes how the bacteria Listeria monocytogenes, a pathogen that causes listeriosis in humans, grows and replicates within macrophages. The researchers used a computational tool called integrative metabolic analysis (iMAT) to analyze the global metabolic state of L. monocytogenes during in macrophage cells and found that several metabolic pathways are active during intracellular growth, including arginine, branched chain amino acid, glycerol, and purine biosynthesis. They identified two new metabolic pathways that were specifically active during intracellular growth, rhamnose utilization and histidine biosynthesis. They also found that low concentrations of certain amino acids, particularly isoleucine, trigger the expression of genes involved in virulence factors and metabolism. The study shows that L. monocytogenes has adapted its metabolism to grow within macrophages, and that the availability of certain amino acids is a signal for the bacteria to indicate its intracellular location. The researchers propose that bacteria like L. monocogenes have evolved ways to modulate their metabolism to exploit nutrients within their hosts, and that this relationship is closely linked to their virulence. The study demonstrates the power of integrative metabolic analysis in understanding the metabolic requirements of microorganisms in their natural environment.
The paper discusses the distribution and genetic diversity of Toxoplasma gondii parasites in Senegal, West Africa. The study found four main clonal lineages of the parasite in Senegal: type II, type III, Africa 1 and Africa 4. The Africa 4 lineage was found mainly in the inland region of Kedougou, while the type II and type III lineages were more common in the coastal regions of Dakar and Saint-Louis. The Africa 1 lineage was found mainly in rural areas of Kedouge. The authors suggest that the high prevalence of Africa 4 lineage in coastal regions may be due to the introduction of this lineage through terrestrial trade, while the low diversity of Africa 1 lineage in Kedouge may be due to its isolation from the transportation network. The study also found that Africa 4, type II and type III lineages are less virulent for mice than Africa 1 lineage, which is lethal for mice, suggesting that the host resistance of the native African rodent species in Kedouge may limit the spread of these virulent lineages. The results provide a framework for understanding the factors driving the distribution of T. gondii populations in West Africa and how they may relate to the high prevalence of ocular toxoplasmosis in the region.
The paper discusses the importance of monitoring the effectiveness of drugs used to control soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH) infections, such as hookworms, roundworms, and Ascaris. The drugs used are currently benzimazole (BZ) and mebendazole (MEB), which are the same class and have the same mode of action. This makes them vulnerable to developing anthelmintic resistance (AR). The authors propose a study to compare four different methods to assess drug efficacy: Kato-Katz smear, Mini-FLOTAC, FECPG2 and qPCR. Kato-Katz smear is the current standard method recommended by WHO. Mini-FLOTAC and FECPG2 are new methods that can be performed without a microscope and automate egg counting. qPCR can differentiate between hookworm species and assess resistance. The study aims to recommend the best methods to monitor drug efficacy and resistance, provide proof-of-principle for qPCR to assess intensity of infection and drug efficacy, and compare pooling samples to determine frequency of resistance markers. The study will provide insights into resistance markers in human hookworms and assess the impact of resistance on drug efficacy. The results are expected to provide recommendations for the scientific community on how to monitor drug efficacy and resistance in PC programs targeting STTH infections.
The paper describes a study that tested a new falls prevention intervention called Respond to the First Fall (RESPOND) in older people who present to the emergency department after a fall. The intervention aimed to reduce falls and injuries through providing personalized education and support to improve knowledge, self-efficacy and participation in evidence-based falls prevention activities. The study found that RESPOND led to a significant reduction in falls but not injuries in these older people, with a reduction in fractures but no change in hospitalizations, ED presentations, deaths or quality of life. The intervention used a telephone-based approach to provide care tailored to individual patient preferences and values, and was delivered over a 6 month period with a face-to-face session and regular phone calls. While the results showed a reduction in falls and fractures, the sample size was small and the study had some limitations, such as high dropout rates and potential biases. The study highlights the importance of targeting falls prevention interventions to frequent fallers and the need for more intensive interventions to affect hospitalization outcomes. The RESPOND program's focus on providing personalized care through positive health messages may be a key component for future falls prevention programs. Further studies are needed to explore the effectiveness of the intervention in different subgroups and to adapt it to target social support for those lacking it.
This paper explores the relationship between population dynamics and evolutionary changes in a social microbial species. The study finds that evolutionary changes in a gene that allows cooperative growth can affect population dynamics, leading to an ecological feedback loop where the evolution of the cooperative gene affects the population size, which in turn affects the evolution of the gene. This feedback loop can cause the population to evolve into a stable equilibrium point where cooperators and cheaters coexist, but the population is less resilient to environmental disturbances. The study shows that this ecological feedback can be observed experimentally by comparing population dynamics and gene frequency over time, and finding that the population is more sensitive to rapid environmental changes than pure cooperators. The findings suggest that understanding the interactions between population dynamics and evolutionary changes in microbial species may be important for explaining variability in cooperative behaviors and the fate of species that rely on cooperation.
This paper used intravital microscopy to study how the immune system responds to Listeria monocytogenes infection in the spleen. The researchers found that CD1c+ cells in the splenic red pulp capture Listeria immediately after injection and migrate to the white pulp to present Listeria antigens to T cells. However, CD1c+ cells do not directly contribute to controlling Listeria growth beyond the first 48 hours of infection. Instead, myelomonocytes (macrophages) and dendritic cells accumulate at Listeria foci and restrict blood flow around infected cells. Antigen-specific CD8+ T cells infiltrate Listeria foci and make prolonged contacts with infected cells, but they do not cause immediate lysis. Instead, they appear to act as "sentinels" for the immune response by detecting and priming adaptive immunity. The researchers also found that Listeria associate with DCs within 2 minutes of injection and DCs do not directly contribute to controlling Listeria growth initially. Instead, DCs may provide a niche for Listeria growth but mediate protection by recruiting innate effectors and presenting antigens to T cells. The study shows that DCs in the splenic red pulp provide a "niche" for Listeria growth but also play a role in priming adaptive immunity.
The paper assessed the relationship between biodiversity and functioning in coral reef ecosystems using a global survey of fish assemblages. The researchers found that while environmental and historical factors can affect the relationship between biodiversity and functioning, there is a non-saturating relationship between the two in coral reefs. Specifically, the more diverse the reefs are, the greater the impact of losing biodiversity on functioning, while the reduction in biomass due to human density is stronger among more diverse reefs. This suggests that the consequences of biodiversity loss may be greater than previously anticipated, particularly for diverse reefs. The results indicate that reefs located near human settlements are particularly vulnerable to human activities, as they are exposed to overexploitation and habitat degradation. The findings highlight the need for comprehensive reef governance at local, regional and global scales to protect biodiversity and coastal ecosystems.
The paper describes a new function of the FOXO transcription factor DAF-16 in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. Previous studies showed that DAF-16 extended lifespan by promoting DNA damage repair, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. However, the authors found that DAF-16 can also shorten lifespan by inducing a tumor-like germline phenotype, including disruption of the gonad basement membrane. They found that the somatic transcription factor SHC-1 antagonizes DAF-16's activity in the germline, leading to the germline hyperplasia and gonad disruption. The authors showed that the lifespan extending effect of DAF-16 was balanced by its lifespan shortening effect, which caused the germline tumor phenotype. They found that mutations in the insulin/IGF signaling pathway that inhibits DAF-16 activity in the soma also caused the germline phenotype. They propose that DAF-16 mediates a cell-nonautonomous signaling to affect germline proliferation and basement membrane integrity. The results suggest that DAF-16 has different functions in the germline and soma, and that SHC-1 regulates the balance between these functions.
The paper describes the discovery of a new protein complex called AP-5 that is involved in endosomal trafficking. The authors identified a previously unknown protein called C14orf108 that interacts with another protein called DKFZp71E98, which they propose to be the μ5 subunit of AP-5. The C14orf108 protein has a similar structure to the μ-adaptin subunits of the other AP complexes, and interacts with DKFZp71E98 in a way that suggests it is a μ subunit. The knockdown of C14orf108 leads to changes in the distribution of certain proteins that are typically associated with the late endosome and lysosomes, indicating that AP-5 likely functions in this compartment. The authors propose that AP-5 is a heterotetramer consisting of two large subunits and a small subunit, and interacts with other accessory proteins. The discovery of AP-5 provides insight into the evolution of the adaptor complexes and the endocytic pathway, and may lead to new avenues for understanding membrane trafficking disorders like hereditary spastic paraplegia.
The paper describes a method to connect neural network modeling and experimental data to generate insights about brain anatomy. The authors develop a theoretical framework that considers both the activity constraints (like avoiding unrealistic high or low activity) and the structural connectivity constraints (like the connectivity of neurons). By analyzing the activity of the model under different activity constraints, they identify critical connections that need to be modified in the model to achieve the desired activity. They use a leaky integrate-and-fire neuron model and apply the method to a multi-scale model of the vision-related areas of the macaque cortex. The modifications they find lead to realistic firing rates in the model, close to those observed experimentally. The approach shows that anatomical data can constrain the model and provide insights into the anatomical connections that are needed for realistic activity, even though the activity data itself is limited. The method can be applied to models with more complex neuron models and can be generalized to higher dimensional systems.
The paper compares the genomes of Strongyloides stercoralis parasites collected from Japan and Myanmar to understand the genetic diversity of this medically important human pathogen. The researchers used whole genome sequencing and analysis to detect genetic variations (heterozygosity) between the samples. They found that the Japanese samples had higher levels of heterozygosity compared to the Myanmar samples, suggesting that the Japanese samples were maintained through autoinfection cycles for a longer time. This resulted in more heterozygous positions accumulating over time. The Myanmar samples, on the other hand, showed evidence of recent sexual reproduction, resulting in lower levels of heterozygosity. The researchers conclude that the frequency of sexual reproduction, which reduces heterozygosity, plays an important role in determining the number of heterozygous sites in the parasite genome and can help infer the history of infections and prevalence of the parasite in a specific area. The findings provide insights into the population structure of Strongyloides stercoralis and the factors that influence its genetic diversity.
The paper investigates how age-related slowing in sensorimotor tasks is related to noise in the system. The authors used a compensatory tracking task with a controlled dynamical system and a Bayesian and quadratic optimality model to analyze data from young and elderly subjects. The results showed that while elderly subjects exhibited increased disorder in their responses, there was no increase in response latency until the onset of the response. Instead, the elderly employed slower control strategies to reduce the effects of noise. The authors conclude that the slowing observed in the elderly is an adaptive response to increased endogenous noise, consistent with the hypothesis that slowing is a result of adaptation to increased noise. The optimal control model presented in the paper quantitatively specifies the extent to which subjects should use slower control strategies to reduce the effects of noise, and finds that the elderly employed simpler control strategies according to this metric. The authors argue that this is consistent with the observed increase in endogenous noise, which they define as any deviation from optimal behavior due to sensory, motor, or neural imperfections. The results demonstrate that age-related slowing is not due to increased latency, but rather an adaptation to increased noise.
The paper describes a study that aimed to identify the spatio-temporal transmission patterns of dengue fever in Guangzhou, China in 2014. The researchers used a mathematical model that combined geographic, demographic, environmental, and surveillance data to estimate the actual infection burden and transmission dynamics. They found that the number of infections was higher in urban areas and the basic reproduction number (an indicator of infection risk) decreased from a peak in September to a trough in November, indicating that intervention measures were effective. However, the reported incidence rates did not always match the actual infections, indicating that the surveillance data had limitations. The researchers hope that by improving the model and incorporating more data, they can provide more accurate information to help policy makers control dengue transmission.
This paper summarizes the results of a systematic review and meta-analysis of 203 studies on factors associated with dengue shock syndrome (DSS), a severe form of dengue fever. The authors identified 23 factors that were significantly associated with DSS, including age (older age), female sex, neurological signs like restlessness and confusion, abdominal pain, gastrointestinal bleeding, hemoconcentration, ascites, pleural effusion, hypoalbuminemia, hepatomegaly, levels of alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase, thrombocytopenia, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen level, secondary infection, and DENV-2. These factors were found to have contradictory effects, with some associated with higher DSS rates while others associated with lower DSS rates. The study suggests that age, female sex, and gastrointestinal bleeding are the most consistently associated with DSS. The findings may help improve understanding the epidemiology and clinical management of DSS. However, the authors note several limitations of the study, including limited information on primary/secondary infection, underlying diseases, early treatment, and the potential ecological fallacy of pooling across studies. Further studies are needed to validate the results and investigate the factors in a time-course profile.
This paper investigates how the timing and synchrony of thalamic inputs affects the feature selectivity of cortical neurons in the primary visual cortex. The authors use a biophysically inspired model to simulate cortical responses to thalamic inputs and quantify how different levels of synchrony impact the information conveyed by the cortical neurons. They find that high levels of synchrony, but not necessarily low levels, lead to higher information transmission efficiency. However, the firing rate also increases with increased synchrony, which can decrease information efficiency. The optimal level of synchrony is found to be around 10-20 ms, consistent with previous findings in the literature. This suggests that the timing and synchrony of thalamic inputs, not just the direct feedforward connections, plays a key role in shaping cortical feature selectivity. The authors argue that the results demonstrate that the timing of thalamic inputs, rather than just the feedforward connections, serves as a key mechanism for establishing cortical feature selectivity.
The paper discusses the mechanism by which neutrophils migrate towards chemoattractants. It shows that neutrophils release extracellular vesicles (exosomes) that contain the signaling molecule leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and the enzymes required for its synthesis. These exosomes act as autocrine signals, mediating the LTB4 signal and relaying the primary chemoattractant signal. The release of exosomes is mediated by Rab27a and sphingomyelinase 2, which are involved in membrane fusion and budding of exosomes. Depletion of these genes leads to defects in neutrophil migration towards chemoattractants. The exosomes are also found to mediate paracrine signaling by acting as molecular beacons for following cells. The study provides insight into how neutrophils migrate in primary chemoattractant gradients and how hydrophobic molecules like LTB4 are packaged and secreted during chemotaxis.
The paper describes the role of a protein called ZHP-4 in the process of meiosis, specifically in the transition from a recombination intermediate to a chiasma capable of directing chromosome segregation at the spindle. ZHP-4 is found to be required in two stages: 1) to stabilize RH-1 at early recombination intermediates to promote the formation of a crossover intermediate, and 2) to localize RH-1 at late pachytene stages to designate crossover sites. The failure to form these late RH-1 foci in mutants correlates with the appearance of abnormal bivalent structures in the diakines nuclei. The results suggest that ZHP-4 acts in concert with ZHP-3 to stabilize RH-1 at early stages and then localize to late pachytene sites where crossovers are designated, ultimately converting recombination intermediates into chiasmata capable of directing chromosome segregation. ZHP-4 mutants exhibit high levels of genetic crossing over but lack the chiasmata, indicating that the crossovers are not visible as foci, and instead result in defects in chromosome remodelling and spindle function. The study argues that ZHP-4 plays an essential role in transforming recombination intermediates into the chiasmata that are capable of directing chromosome segregation at meiotic spindle.
According to the paper, Francisella tularensis is a bacterium that causes pulmonary tularemia in humans and animals. It has two main subtypes, Type A and Type B, with Type A causing lethal disease in humans and animals. Type A strains are highly pathogenic and infect both humans and animals. The authors found that mice lacking the Nlrp3 inflammasome protein are more resistant to Francisella infection, while mice lacking the Aim2 inflammasome are less susceptible. They found that Nlrp3 is activated by Francisella species in general, and that Nlrp3-deficient mice have reduced bacterial burden and lung pathology during infection. They also found that Nlrp3-deficient mice exhibit an early neutrophil response and reduced numbers of immature myeloid cells, which likely contributes to their increased susceptibility. They conclude that Nlrp3 drives host mortality in an inflammasome-independent fashion by preventing the early neutrophil response and promoting myeloid cell death. The exact mechanisms of cell death remain unclear, but the authors suggest that Nlrp3-dependent necrotic death likely contributes to lung damage and host susceptibility during pulmonary tularemia.
This paper investigates the evolutionary history of the immunity-related GTPases (IRG) gene family, which has been associated with Crohn's disease. The IRG gene family used to exist in multiple copies in most mammalian species but has been reduced to two copies in humans. The authors compare the IRG gene organization in different primate species, including monkeys and apes, finding that the human IRG gene has a restored, albeit truncated, ORF while the other primates have pseudogenized copies. They suggest that the human IRG gene became nonfunctional 40 million years ago and was resurrected 20 million years ago, coinciding with the integration of an ERV9 retroviral element that serves as a promoter for the gene. This led to changes in gene expression and splicing patterns that may be related to the gene's role in autophagy and Crohn's disease. The study suggests that genes can experience dynamic evolutionary pressures over time, leading to functional changes that may help explain the association with the disease.
The paper discusses the relapse rate in visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in HIV patients. The authors found that even after successful treatment for VL, many patients still have remaining parasites in their body, leading to persistent infection and a higher risk of relapse. They conducted a prospective cohort study of 54 VL patients in Ethiopia to investigate the long-term outcomes of VL in HIV patients, including relapse-free survival and risk factors for relapse or death. They found that among patients with a CD4 cell count below 20 cells/μL, 50% relapsed and 4% died, while among those with a CD4 cell count above 20 cells/μL, 53% relapsed and 54% died. The use of secondary prophylaxis with pentamidine for these patients reduced the relapse rate to 50-60%, although the sample size was too small to determine if there were differences between the two groups. The authors recommend secondary prophylaxis for patients whose CD4 cell count remains below 20 cells/μL after successful VL treatment and those with a history of previous VL treatment. However, they note that the management of HIV and VL requires a multifactorial approach, including effective ART and clinical and CD4 cell monitoring. They argue that while the study shows pentamidine is safe and effective, more research is needed to determine the optimal dose and frequency for secondary prophylaxis.
The paper discusses how changes in gene regulation have been found in many species, which have a significant impact on cell and organism phenotypes. The authors use a phylogenetic approach to study changes in transcription factor binding sites (TBSs) across closely related species, finding that a large fraction of TBSs have diverged. They propose a "semiconserved" model, which assumes that TBSs that have lost constraint on one lineage but not others have lost function. They test this model by looking for lineage-specific loss of TBSs, and find that many such sites show species-specific changes in gene expression. They also experimentally test whether the predicted substitutions leading to TBS loss actually affect gene expression. They find that in three cases, the predicted substitutions caused changes in gene expression. They conclude that the semiconserved model provides an efficient way to identify loss of constraint on a putative TBS, but there are many false positives and false negatives, and more comparative data would be needed to reliably identify functional divergence in cis-regulatory sequences.
This paper describes a new method to identify and characterize proteins that insects secrete into their saliva as effectors that manipulate host plant processes. The authors used a functional genomics approach to identify candidate effectors from the green peach aphid species Myzus persicae. They analyzed the salivary gland expressed tags (ESTs) of the aphids and found 46 candidates that were secreted into the saliva through the classical endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi pathway. They cloned the predicted effectors and expressed them in Nicotiana benthamiana to assess their effects on the plant. They found 3 effectors, Mp10, Mp4, and MpC02, that reduced aphid performance, while Mp42 enhanced aphid performance. The study shows that some of these effectors may function as plant pathogen effectors by suppressing plant defenses, inducing plant phenotypes, and perturbing cellular processes. The results suggest that aphids secrete proteins into their saliva to manipulate plant processes during feeding, similar to how plant pathogens do. This study provides new insights into the molecular basis of plant-insect interactions.
The paper discusses how to analyze and diagnose diseases from high-dimensional single-cell data, where each cell exhibits a complex combination of multiple characteristics or parameters. The authors propose using the following approach: 1) group cells into "supercells" based on a systematic parameter size (N) and then 2) apply machine learning to determine the most important parameters that distinguish between healthy and diseased cells. They show that this approach can accurately classify diseases based on a subset of cells, even when individual cell measurements are not sufficient. The number of cells needed to achieve accurate classification depends on the number of parameters used and the complexity of the disease, with fewer cells needed when there are fewer parameters. The approach was applied to two examples: diagnosing Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome and distinguishing between two types of eye diseases. The results show that for Hutchinson-Gilford progeria, the number of invaginations of the nuclear boundary was the most important parameter, while for the eye diseases, a combination of 5 parameters was sufficient. The approach provides a guideline for how many cells and measurements are needed to accurately diagnose diseases from high-dimensional single-cell data.
The paper describes a new mechanism of how the bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa regulates its virulence and biofilm formation. The researchers found that a protein called RhlR can function independently of its known ligand, C4-HSL, and instead responds to an alternative ligand that is present in biofilms. This ligand enables RhlR to activate genes that are normally controlled by RhlI, which requires C4-HSL. This alternative ligand is present in biofilms but not in planktonic cultures. This mechanism allows RhlR to control genes that are important for virulence and biofilm formation in a way that is distinct from the classical C4-HSL-RhlI system. The findings suggest that targeting RhlR with small molecule inhibitors could be a promising approach for developing new antibiotics against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is a pathogen that has become resistant to many common antibiotics.
The paper investigated the relationship between coding variation and atrial fibrillation (AF) in a large sample of individuals using whole exome sequencing. The study found that there was limited evidence of coding variation associated with AF, despite prior literature suggesting that coding variation may be a major contributor to the condition. The study suggests that noncoding variation, particularly common genetic variants near ion channels and transcription factors, may be more likely to contribute to AF. The authors conclude that efforts to identify therapeutic targets for AF through exome sequencing will require larger samples or populations enriched for large genetic effects, and that whole genome sequencing may be more effective. The study had limitations in detecting rare coding variants due to sample size and power.
The paper discusses how certain lipopeptides, which are similar to bacterial cell wall components, can enhance the ability of the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) to infect cells. The lipoptides bind to the virus and enhance its binding to cells, allowing it to infect more efficiently. This enhancement is independent of the TLR signaling pathway, which is activated by the lipoptides. The lipoptides are found to enhance infections with RSV, HIV, human metapneumovirus and measles virus. The study suggests that carriage of respiratory bacteria in the upper or lower respiratory tract may facilitate binding of RSV to target cells and thus play a role in the pathogenesis of severe RSV bronchiolitis. The lipoptides have the potential to be used as adjuvants for live-attenuated RSV vaccines, as they can enhance binding of a live-attenuated RSV vaccine administered intra-nasally while also stimulating innate immune responses.
The paper describes an approach to understanding how transcription factors regulate gene expression in human cells. They used a combination of transcription factor knockdown experiments and binding data to determine which genes are directly bound by the knocked down transcription factors and which genes are differentially expressed following the knockdown. They found that while most of the differentially expressed genes are not directly bound by the knocked down factor, there is a correlation between the number of binding sites near the target genes and the degree of expression change following the knockdown. This suggests that functional binding sites are associated with stronger binding motifs and greater distances from the transcription start site. They also found that factors tend to have a balanced effect of either activating or repressing their targets, rather than a consistent direction. The results suggest that functional binding is associated with evolutionary pressures that have selected for properties like increased affinity and cooperativity. However, the results indicate that the current definition of functional binding based on proximity to the transcription start site is likely to underestimate the true number of functionally bound genes, and more work is needed to explain the observed trends.
The paper describes a new approach to identifying conserved regions in the HIV genome that can reveal previously unknown functional elements. The authors used a novel scale-free method to analyze HIV genetic data, rather than assuming a specific scale of conserved features. This allowed them to detect novel conserved regions that previous methods missed. They identified 111 conserved regions, some of which corresponded to known functional elements like splice sites and regulatory regions, but others they could not fully explain. The authors also analyzed the secondary structure of these regions and found some conserved structures that were novel and plausible, including a stable structure surrounding the central polypurine tract. These structures may play a role in the splicing and dimerization of the viral RNA. The results suggest that conserved regions within the spliced RNA folds could contribute to the extensive utilization of a particular splice acceptor cluster and provide a switch mechanism to prevent dimerization. The approach identified regions of conserved structure that could be functionally important but require experimental validation. The authors propose that some of the identified conserved regions represent potential drug targets. The approach can be applied to other RNA viruses to reveal new insights into their genomes.
This paper investigated the roles of the ROR and REV-ERB genes in regulating Bmal1 expression and rhythmicity in mice. The researchers found that the REV-ERB genes are required for Bmal1 rhythmic expression, while the ROR genes are not. The REV-ERB genes play a more prominent role in regulating Bmal1 expression than the ROR genes. The REV-ERB genes also help maintain the amplitude of Bmal1 expression, while the ROR genes primarily contribute to the phase of Bmal1 expression. The researchers used cell-based models and real-time bioluminescence monitoring to study the expression of the ROR and REV-ERB genes and their impact on Bmal1 expression and rhythmicity. They found that cells lacking the ROR genes still exhibit rhythmic Bmal1 expression, while cells lacking the REV-ERB genes exhibit arrhythmic Bmal1 expression. These findings suggest that the REV-ERB genes provide additional opportunities to control the phases of gene expression in peripheral tissues. The REV-ERB genes are required for the rhythmic expression of Bmal1 and other output genes, while the ROR genes primarily regulate the amplitude of Bmal1 expression. The study provides mechanistic insights into how the genes in the clock circuitry are regulated in vivo and how the interlocking loops function to modulate the phases of gene expression. The findings suggest that the REV-ERB genes are more important for providing phase information to local output genes, while the ROR genes primarily contribute to the amplitude of gene expression.
The paper describes a study of the antibody status of survivors of the 2013-2016 West African Ebola virus outbreak in Sierra Leone. The researchers collected blood samples from 481 survivors 15-32 months after recovery and 38 close contacts of infected individuals. They found that 97% of survivors had antibodies against the virus' three major proteins (GP, NP, and VP40), but only 2.3% had no antibodies against any of the proteins. They also found that 85% of survivors had higher antibody levels against NP compared to the other two proteins. Close contacts had lower antibody levels and less neutralizing antibodies compared to survivors. The study suggests that 2-3% of survivors had low or short-lived antibody responses, likely due to technical errors or immune defects. The study concludes that 97% of survivors had antibodies against the virus, but 2.3% had no antibodies, suggesting that some may have had low-level exposure to the virus. Asymptomatic cases of Ebola virus infection have been documented in other viral infections, and studying these cases could help clarify their role in transmission dynamics.
This paper proposes a method to identify the minimal circuitry generating specific oscillations in a layered cortical network. The method combines mean-field theory and linear response theory to analyze the population rate spectra of a spiking neuron model. The authors first determine the time-averaged firing rates that reproduce experimental data, then analyze the fluctuations of activity around this stationary state using linear response theory. They find that the population rate spectra can be approximated by a linear rate model, and the eigenvalue trajectories of the effective connectivity matrix provide insight into the contributions of individual connections to the oscillations. The authors then identify the connections that are most important for generating specific frequency peaks in the population rate spectra. They demonstrate the method by analyzing a microcircuit model, showing how the sensitivity measure can predict changes in the spectra when individual connections are altered. The method can be used to identify the minimal circuitry that generates specific oscillations in more complex networks. The findings provide insight into the anatomical and dynamical origins of population rate oscillations and may guide the design of optogenetic tools to modulate these oscillations in the future.
This paper investigates the role of the DdrB protein in DNA repair and recombination in the bacterium Deinoccal radiodans. The authors find that DdrB plays a key role in recombination between direct repeats in Deinoccal radiodans, leading to deletions of the tetA gene when exposed to ionizing radiation. They show that the absence of DdrB leads to a decrease in the frequency of deletions between repeats, suggesting that DdrB is involved in a single-strand annealing pathway. This is in contrast to the RecA-dependent pathway, which does not depend on DdrB. The results suggest that DdrB plays an important role in the genome plasticity of Deinoccal radiodans and that single strand annealing may be an early step in genome reconstitution after radiation exposure. The paper also finds that the distance between the repeats does not affect the frequency of deletions, indicating that the mechanism involves a slipped misalignment of the lagging strand template. The results provide insights into how DdrB contributes to DNA repair and recombination in this radioresistant bacterium.
The paper investigates how the spatial representation in the hippocampus is organized and how it relates to the spatial representation in the medial entorhinal cortex. The traditional view is that the hippocampus contains sparse place cells that encode spatial information, while the medial entorhinal cortex contains grid cells that encode hexagonal lattice patterns. However, recent experiments have shown that grid cells can also generate place cells independently of grid-field firing, and vice versa. The authors propose that the hippocampus may primarily use the grid cells to synchronize the two representations, rather than transfer space information. They model this using a feedforward grid-to-place transformation, where grid cells generate place cells by shifting their firing patterns. The grid cells are sparse, while the place cells are dense. The authors show that a small number of grid cells can encode multiple environments at a similar spatial resolution, but the place cells degenerate with increasing number of remappings. The degeneration is due to interference from multiple place fields. The results suggest that the spatial representation in the hippocampus is not primarily optimized for coding precision, but serves other purposes like sparseness and synchronization.
The paper describes a study that aimed to develop a predictive model using electronic health records (EHR) data to identify hospitalized patients who are likely to develop acute kidney injury (AKI) within 24 hours. The model was developed using data from three hospitals and found that variables like changes in creatinine levels over the past 48 hours, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), and recent creatinine measurements were the strongest predictors of AKI. The researchers found that a simple model using only laboratory values performed nearly as well as the full model and maintained its performance across the hospitals and outcomes. They hypothesize that providers could use this model to identify patients who are likely to develop AKI and adjust their care accordingly, potentially preventing disease progression. However, the model does not provide explanations for why certain patients develop AKI, and urine output was not included since it was limited in the data. The model's performance should be validated on other EHR systems and it is unclear how best to use the predictions to minimize intervention fatigue.
The paper discusses the results of a study conducted in Ecuador to evaluate the effectiveness of mass distribution of ivermectin on the prevalence of Strongyloides stercoralis, a parasite that causes river blindness. The study looked at the prevalence of this parasite in areas where ivermectin was distributed as part of an onchocercias elimination program, and compared it to areas where it was not distributed. The results showed that the prevalence of S. stercoralis was significantly lower in areas where ivermectin was distributed, both in children and adults. The study also found that the prevalence of other soil-transmitted helminths (Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura and hookworm) was lower in areas where ivermectin was distributed. While the study had some limitations, the results suggest that regular distribution of ivermectin mass treatment can have a significant impact on the prevalence of S. stercoralis in areas with high prevalence of strongyloidias, and could potentially be used as part of preventive chemotherapy campaigns to control other soil-transmitted helminths. The study also suggests that including ivermectin in preventive chemotherapy regimens for lymphatic filariasis may be beneficial, as it is more effective than the current combination of albendazole and diethylcarbamazine.
This paper describes the structural organization of the foamy virus glycoproteins (Gag and Envelope) within the virus particle using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and cryo-substitution. The authors found that the glycoproteins form hexagonal networks that are trimeric in nature, with each trimer interacting with three other trimers, forming a hexagonal lattice. They also identified specific features of the glycoprotein structure, such as the central spike region and transmembrane helices. They found that the capsid is surrounded by an intermediate shell of density that is not directly attached to the viral membrane, but interacts with the gag and envelope glycoproteins. They propose that this intermediate shell is derived from the gag N-terminal domain and cytoplasmic domain of the envelope protein. They also observed that the capsid is larger in viruses that bud directly from the plasma membrane, and that this larger capsid is likely the mature form of the virus. They suggest that the hexagonal organization of the glycoprotein lattice may provide an advantage for efficient receptor binding and viral entry. Overall, their findings provide new insights into the structure and function of foamy virus particles, which could inform the development of foamy virus as a gene therapy vector.
The paper describes a new method called Epicast that leverages collective human judgment to forecast infectious disease outbreaks. The authors collected predictions from a large number of people using a website and aggregated them to produce a single forecast for each target. They compared Epicast with other statistical and data-driven methods in forecasting the 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 US flu seasons and the 2014-2015 chikungunya invasion of the Americas. They found that Epicast performed reasonably well, especially for short-term predictions, but had higher error rates for long-term predictions. They discuss the strengths and limitations of using human judgment, including that it can handle rare events and lack of historical data, but requires a large number of participants and is sensitive to bias. They propose combining human and statistical methods in the future to create a hybrid framework. The authors conclude that both human and machine approaches have strengths and weaknesses and that combining them could create a more accurate forecasting system.
The paper proposes a new method to identify groups of genomic loci (called "Population Covering Locus Sets" or PoCos) that are associated with a disease. PoCos are groups of loci that collectively cover a larger fraction of cases and minimally cover controls, while containing functionally related loci. The authors use a greedy algorithm to identify PoCos without prior biological knowledge, and also identify PoCos that are connected in a network of functional relationships among loci. They then use these PoCos to build features for risk assessment using logistic regression. The results show that PoCos perform significantly better than using individual loci or polygenic scores in predicting disease risk. Integration of functional information from protein-protein interactions and expression quantitative trait loci also leads to more parsimonious models. The authors argue that PoCos are useful for identifying functionally related loci and combining them with non-genetic factors may lead to further improvements in risk assessment.
This paper discusses how a protein called FAK (Focal Adhesion Kinase) regulates the activity of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) in Drosophila. The authors found that FAK negatively regulates RTK signaling, specifically the MAPK pathway, which in turn impacts cellular outcomes. When RTK signaling is high, FAK inhibits the MAPK pathway. This negative feedback loop determines the balance between RTK and FAK activity, which ultimately determines cellular fate. FAK was found to regulate receptor recycling, specifically the subcellular localization of EGFR, to reduce MAPK signaling. This mechanism of FAK inhibiting RTK signaling is conserved across different tissues and is evolutionarily conserved. The paper suggests that targeting FAK may be a useful strategy for cancer therapy, but FAK downregulation can also be associated with cancer. The authors propose that FAK acts as a "scaffold protein" that regulates RTK recycling and signaling. However, the mechanism of FAK regulation of MAPK signaling is context-dependent and may be different in different tissues and cells.
This paper presents a study on the genetic analysis of the HLA locus, a region on chromosome 6 that has been linked to the autoimmune disease IgA deficiency (IgAD). The researchers used a high-density SNP panel containing 1,686 SNPs to genotype 72 IgAD cases and 1976 controls from 3 European populations (Swedish, Icelandic, Finnish and Spanish). They found that the HLA-DQB1*02 allele (which includes the DQB1*02 and DQB1*02 alleles) was the strongest genetic risk factor for IgAD, and the association was observed in all three populations. They also found that recombinant (non-B*0801) DRB*0301 haplotypes, which carry the DQB1*02 allele, showed no association with IgAD, suggesting that the causal variant is likely located within the HLA-B*08-DR1-DQB1 region. The HLA-DRB*102 allele was also found to be a strong risk allele. The researchers used a long-range haplotype phasing approach to infer individual haplotypes and found that the association with IgAD was contributed by two independent susceptibility loci: the DQB*02 allele on the extended HLA-B*08-DR1-DQB1 haplotype, and another variant located within the HLA-B*08-DR1-DQB1-DR1 haplotype. They also found that recombinant (non-B*080) DRB*07 haplotypes showed no association with IgAD, suggesting that the causal allele is likely located in the HLA-B*14-DR1-QB1 region. Additional associations were found with the HLA-B*14-DR2 haplotype and the protective HLA-DRB*15 allele. The results suggest that IgAD susceptibility is the result of multilocus effects that span the entire HLA region and that the causal variants may be conserved in ancestral haplotypes. The findings provide insights into the location of shared genetic effects and may help
The paper discusses how protein disorder and intrinsic propensities for polyproline II (PPII) structure can be used to predict the radius of gyration (Rh) for intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Experimental values of Rh for IDPs are compared to those predicted by using a simple power-law scaling relationship based on the number of residues (N) and the average intrinsic PPII propensity for the protein chain (fPPIIchain). The paper finds that the experimental values of Rh for IDPs are generally larger than those predicted by the power-law relationship, indicating that there are other factors beyond PPII propensity that influence Rh. The paper also shows that charge effects on Rh can be weakened by mixing positive and negative charges in a sequence. However, charges separated by 2 or fewer residue positions have a larger effect on Rh, while charges separated by more than 9 Å have little effect. The study suggests that the relationship between Rh, N and fPPIIchain is an idealization that excludes other molecular factors, but that charge effects can be modulated by sequence context. The results provide evidence that PPI propensities play a significant role in determining the structure of IDPs and how they respond to discrete perturbations.
The paper discusses how sand flies transmit Leishmania parasites to mammal hosts by biting them and depositing the parasites in the skin. The sand flies also deposit a saliva containing a repertoire of proteins that help them feed. Some of these proteins are immunogenic in humans and mice, and repeated exposure to sand fly saliva has been shown to protect mice against Leishmania infection. However, only two of these proteins, Maxadilan from Lutzomyia longipalpis and PpSP5 from Phlebotus papatasi, have shown promise as protective molecules against Leishmania. The authors investigated how immunity to specific sand fly salivary proteins affects the outcome of Leishmania infection in mice. They found that immunization with one of these two proteins, PpSP5, protected mice against Leishmania infection, while immunization with the other, PpSP4, exacerbated the infection. The authors conclude that immunity to distinct salivary proteins has a polarizing effect on the outcome of Leishmania infection, with PpSP5 inducing a Th1 response and PpSP4 inducing a Th2 response. This polarization of immunity towards a Th1 or Th2 response is correlated with the observed protection or exacerbation of infection. The study suggests that the early induction of a distinct Th1-type immune response by salivary proteins is important for priming a protective immunity against Leishmania infection.
This paper describes the discovery of an in vitro circadian oscillator composed of the proteins KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC from the cyanobacterium Synechocococcus elongatus. The authors used electron microscopy and crystallography to determine the structures of these proteins and analyze the interactions between them. They found that KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC form complexes that oscillate over the circadian cycle in a regulated manner, with KaiC phosphorylation being the driving force behind the oscillations. Monomer exchange between hexamers is proposed to synchronize the population of phosphorylated KaiC and allow sustained oscillations. The authors used molecular dynamics simulations to model the interactions between these proteins and predict the formation of different complexes at each phase of the oscillation. They found that monomer exchange allows for synchronization of the population of phosphorylated KaiC and is a key factor in maintaining the oscillations. They also showed that the oscillator is sensitive to temperature pulses and can be reset by low temperature pulses, providing a possible mechanism for entrainment of the clock. This in vitro oscillator provides insights into the molecular mechanisms of the cyanobacterial circadian clock and the possibility of a purely post-translational clock in eukaryotic cells.
This paper studied how frequently and when school-based mass drug administration (MDA) of praziquantel was effective at reducing schistosomiasis infection in Kenyan children aged 9-12 years old. They found that biennial treatment (every other year) was as effective as annual treatment in reducing prevalence and intensity of infection, but achieving a 50% reduction in prevalence was difficult. While MDA alone may not be sufficient to eliminate schistosomiasis, it can help gain and sustain control. The study found that school-based MDA could reduce prevalence in some communities from moderate to low-risk, but not to a complete elimination. The study also found that some children not enrolled in school were still infected, suggesting that environmental transmission may still occur. Despite not achieving the target sample sizes, the study is the largest randomized trial comparing MDA regimens to date and provides valuable insights for schistosomiasis control programs.
This paper discusses how a parasite called Toxoplasma gondii can manipulate the migration of immune cells in the body to aid in its own infection. Toxoplasma invades immune cells and induces a hypermotile phenotype, which allows it to quickly move around the body and spread to different organs. The researchers found that this hypermotility is dependent on a type of ion channel called a voltage-gated calcium channel, specifically the L-type channel Cav1.3. When the researchers blocked this channel or inhibited the parasite's ability to activate it, they found that the hypermotility was lost. They propose that the parasite activates the channel by releasing the neurotransmitter GABA, which causes a depolarization of the immune cell membrane. This depolarization activates the L-type channel and allows calcium to enter the cell, leading to the hypermotility. The researchers suggest that this mechanism allows the parasite to rapidly manipulate calcium signaling pathways in the immune cells, bypassing transcriptional regulation, to quickly induce hypermotility and spread to different organs. This may help the parasite to establish infection and establish a systemic infection. The findings suggest a new mechanism by which intracellular parasites manipulate calcium signaling pathways in immune cells, providing a potential new target for controlling parasite infection.
The paper describes the identification of a novel mechanism by which the filovirus protein VP40 is regulated by a host protein called BAG3. VP4 is the most abundant protein in the virion and is essential for virus assembly and egress. VP4 has a PxY motif that interacts with host proteins to promote egress, but expression of VP4 alone is not sufficient to form infectious virus. BAG3, a protein involved in cellular protein quality control, interacts with the PxY motif of VP4 in a W-domain dependent manner, sequestering VP4 away from the site of budding and into aggresomes. This inhibits VP4-mediated egress of viral particles and infectious virus. BAG3 is a cellular stress-induced protein that regulates protein homeostasis and sequesters proteins for degradation by the proteasome. The authors show that BAG3 inhibits VP4-mediated budding in a PxY/W-domain dependent manner, involving relocalization of VP4 to aggresomes and sequestration of a fraction of VP4 away from the site of budding at the plasma membrane. They propose that BAG3 represents a novel host defense mechanism to dampen filovirus egress via cellular protein quality control.
The paper proposes a new theory on how the locus coeruleus (LC), a part of the brain that releases noradrenaline, modulates behavioral flexibility in response to changes in the environment. According to the theory, the LC responds to "state-action prediction errors" which are the differences between the agent's current model of the world and the actual outcomes of its actions. When the environment changes, the LC releases noradrenaline which temporarily enhances the connections between neurons in the brain, allowing the agent to learn new information and adapt its model. This leads to a temporary increase in model updating, which is reflected in LC activity. The LC then responds to the outcome of this updated model by firing in a phasic or tonic manner depending on the magnitude of the state-action prediction error. This response from the LC is linked to the agent's ability to adapt its behavioral strategy, leading to the observed phasic-tonic shifts in LC dynamics seen in experimental studies. The theory integrates noradrenaline release into an active inference framework which can model the LC as a source of modulation for adaptive behavior. This approach can explain the observed LC activity and behavioral changes in response to environmental volatility, and may provide insight into symptoms of disorders linked to LC dysfunction.
The paper discusses the role of delta T cells in hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Delta T cells are a type of immune cell that can recognize phosphorylated proteins on infected cells and kill them. The study found that delta T cells are preserved in frequency and function in people with chronic HBV infection, but with distinct phenotypes and functions compared to those in uninfected controls. In people with acute HBV infection, delta T cells showed increased expression of Tbet and Eomes markers, which are associated with an exhausted immune state. In contrast, delta T cells from people with chronic HBV infection showed increased expression of inhibitory receptors and had less effector function. The paper suggests that delta T cells may play a role in lymphoid stress surveillance during HBV infection and that their early response to phosphorylated proteins may be a biomarker for immune activity beyond liver damage. However, the study found that delta T cell function did not improve even months after HBV DNA levels declined, suggesting that delta T cells may not be able to fully exert their antiviral effects in people with chronic HBV infection. The study highlights the potential role of delta T cells in HBV pathogenesis and suggests that their early response to phosphorylated proteins may be a useful biomarker for immune activity beyond liver damage.
The paper discusses how the bacteria Staphylocococcus aureus (SA) causes severe pneumonia, especially in immunocompromised patients, and how the methicillin resistant strain USA30 is particularly virulent. It identifies a key mechanism of damage caused by SA toxins that induces cell death called necroptosis. This process, which involves the activation of MLKL, is responsible for the inflammation and lung damage seen in SA infections. The authors show that the toxin Hla activates MLKL and induces necroptosis in immune cells, especially macrophages, which leads to loss of immune cells and inflammation. They demonstrate that inhibiting necroptosis in mice protected them from the inflammation and lung damage caused by SA infection. They suggest that targeting the necroptosis pathway could be a potential way to prevent SA-induced lung damage and pneumonia.
This paper uses Bayesian modeling and gene expression analysis to study the developmental dynamics of plant height in a Brassica rapa recombinant inbred line. They fit function-valued trait models to estimate continuous growth curves of plant height and find that plant height parameters like duration and final size are correlated with plant fitness and yield. They map quantitative trait loci (QTL) for plant height and find that QTL are enriched for expression traits identified through mutual rank co-expression and weighted gene co-expression network analyses. They use eQTL mapping to identify genes that likely regulate the expression of these expression traits and find that cis-eQTL are likely to be causal for the QTL. They also find that many expression traits have only one or a few eQTL, indicating that expression traits tend to be monogenic while QTL tend to be polygenic. This suggests that the regulatory mechanisms of expression traits and QTL are different. The study demonstrates the importance of examining plant developmental dynamics in an agriculturally relevant setting to better understand how plant traits are linked to plant fitness.
The paper describes how the enzyme Vanilly alcohol oxidase (VAO) uses ligand migration paths to catalyze the oxidation of aromatic compounds. The enzyme has a large size and requires multiple ligands to bind. The authors used a computational method called Protein Energy Landscape Exploration (PELE) to identify three possible ligand migration paths into and out of the active site of the enzyme: a cap path, a FAD path, and a subunit interface path. They found that the subunit interface path is the most likely path for ligands to enter and exit the active site, and that two residues in this path, His46 and Tyr503, act as "concierges" to limit access to the active site. The re path identified for dioxygen and hydrogen peroxide is the shortest path from the FAD side of the enzyme and allows them to migrate directly to the solvent. The cap path and FAD path are less likely for larger ligands and require large movements of amino acid side chains. The results suggest that the subunit interface path is the most probable route for ligands to enter and exit the active site, and that His46 and Tyr503 are involved in substrate migration. The study provides a new understanding of how ligand migration affects the mechanism of VAO and its close relatives EUGO and PCM.
The paper discusses a new algorithm called convexcluster that uses convex clustering to address some limitations of hierarchical clustering. Hierarchical clustering has stability issues with small data perturbations and is sensitive to outliers, but it is fast and visually appealing. Convex clustering uses a penalty term to minimize a loss function, which ensures a globally optimal solution exists. The authors describe strategies for choosing weights that make the convex clustering algorithm more robust. They demonstrate that convex clustering can be more nuanced than hierarchical clustering by examining the dynamic behavior of the solution path as the penalty parameter is increased. They show that convex clustering is more accurate when data is noisy and can handle missing data. They also show that convex clustering can scale to modern genomic data sizes. While hierarchical clustering is more practical for low noise data, the authors suggest that convex clustering's ability to reliably provide an entire solution path and insights into cluster relationships make it a valuable tool for large datasets.
The paper discusses the results of a study on imported neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) diagnosed in immigrants and travelers seen at a tropical medicine clinic in Madrid, Spain. The study found that NTDs were more common among immigrants than travelers, with the most common being ascariasis, followed by schistosomiasis, onchoceriasis and leishmaniasis. The majority of patients with NTDs were from sub-Saharan Africa. The number of cases of onchocercias decreased over time, likely due to control programs in the countries of origin. The study highlights the fact that NTDs are not limited to tropical areas and can be diagnosed in countries of the developed world, especially among immigrants and travelers. However, the study notes that the epidemiology of NTDs is influenced by the interactions between the pathogen, host, vector and environment, and that global changes in climate and temperatures may affect the distribution of vectors and lead to the emergence of NTDs outside their usual areas. The paper concludes that recognizing the impact of NTDs in the developed world could lead to more combined international efforts to control these infections.
This paper describes an experiment that investigated how DNA mismatch repair proteins track with the replisome during DNA replication. The researchers found that both MutSα and MutSβ, which are involved in repairing mismatches, track with the replisome during DNA replication, not just the leading strand polymerase. The study showed that both proteins are present at active origins of replication and move bi-directionally along the DNA as the replication forks progress. This is consistent with the idea that the mismatch repair proteins are in close proximity to the strand specificity signals, such as the 3' hydroxyl group of newly synthesized strands, which helps guide the repair process. The researchers also found that the MutSβ signal persists even after the leading strand polymerase has cleared the region. They propose a model where MutSα and MutSβ load at active origins and scan independently of the replisome but interact with PCNA molecules that remain behind the replisome to remain in close proximity to the strand specificity signals. PCNA is known to accumulate behind the replisome during DNA replication. The study provides evidence that both MutSα and MutSβ are needed to efficiently repair the full range of mismatches generated during replication.
The paper discusses the structure and function of the pseudokinase protein STRADα. STRADα lacks key residues needed for catalytic activity but still adopts an active conformation that binds ATP and activates the LKB1 tumor suppressor protein. The structure of STRADα reveals that it has evolved novel mechanisms to bind ATP and MO25α, a protein that interacts with the pseudokinase domain of STRADα. The authors show that binding of ATP and MO25α stabilizes the active conformation of STRADα and enables it to activate LKB1. Mutations that prevent binding to either ATP or MO25α no longer activate LKB1. They propose a model of how STRADα/MO25α interacts and activates LKB1 based on their structural and mutational data. Overall, the paper suggests that the closed active conformation of pseudokinases like STRADα may be sufficient to regulate signal transduction pathways, even though they lack intrinsic catalytic activity.
The paper proposes a new method called "Probabilistic Trait Locus Linkage" (ptl) mapping to detect genetic variants that affect the probabilistic properties of single-cell traits. This method is designed to complement traditional QTL mapping by identifying genetic loci that modify cell-cell variability, rather than just the mean or variance of a trait. The authors show that by scanning for scPTL, they were able to identify genetic variants that were missed by classical QTL mapping. They demonstrate the method using simulations and real data from yeast, where they applied it to identify a locus that modulated cell-cell variability of the activation of the GAL regulon. The approach could potentially be used to identify genetic factors that affect developmental processes and cancer cell heterogeneity. The method is open to improvement and could be extended to other types of functions.
The paper discusses a new mechanism for regulating the activity of a protein called Nrf2, which is important for protecting cells against stress. The authors found that a protein called WDR23 can regulate Nrf2 levels independently of a previously known mechanism involving a protein called KEAP1. They showed that WDR23 can reduce Nrf2 levels by interacting with it and promoting its degradation through the ubiquitin proteasome system. This allows WDR23 to turn off Nrf2 activity when needed, which is important for cell survival. They found that cancer cells often have mutations in WDR23, which can restore regulation of Nrf2 and sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs. Overexpression of WDR23 in cancer cells makes them more sensitive to chemotherapy drugs, suggesting that targeting this pathway could be a new approach to treat cancer.
The paper describes how using quantitative measurements of eye color, rather than categorical classifications, can be used to identify new genetic variants that contribute to eye color. The authors used high-resolution digital photographs of people's irises to quantify the amount and type of pigment in their eyes. They found that different genes were associated with different aspects of eye color, such as hue (H) and saturation (S). By analyzing these H and S values, they identified 3 new genetic variants that were not detected with categorical eye color measurements. These new variants were found to be associated with different eye colors and explained a small portion of the remaining unexplained variance in eye color. The authors conclude that quantitative measurements of eye color can be used to identify new genetic variants that contribute to eye color, which could be useful for for forensic applications.
The paper describes a study on how adding sheep skin odors to CO2-baited CD light traps improved mosquito trap catches for Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) vectors. The study used sheep fur samples to release host odors for the traps, which were found to attract more mosquitoes compared to the standard CO2-baited light traps alone. This suggests that sheep odors play a role in mosquito host-location behavior. The study shows that the addition of sheep odors to the CO2-baited light traps increased trap catches of key and primary RVFV vectors by 3-4 times and 4-5 times, respectively, compared to the control traps. However, the effect of the sheep odors on trap catches was not consistent across all mosquito species, and some species showed reduced attraction. The results suggest that host odors are important signals for mosquito host-location. Identifying the specific compounds in sheep odors that contribute to this attraction could lead to the development of improved traps for monitoring RVFV vectors. However, more research is needed to fully understand the behavioral effects of these odors.
The paper describes a study that found that 19.2% of people in a remote region of the Solomon Islands had scabies, a parasitic infestation of the skin caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei, and 26.7% had active impetigo, a bacterial skin infection. The study found that scabies was more common in children under 15 and infants, and was associated with a higher risk of developing active impetigo. The study also found that the prevalence of scabies was higher in those living in crowded households, but the association was not statistically significant. The authors suggest that community control of scabies could help reduce the burden of impetigo and its complications. The study highlights the need for more research on standardized methods for diagnosing and treating scabies and impetigo in field settings to improve public health management.
The paper describes a large-scale study on leptospirosis in Thailand from 2010 to 2015. The study used serological tests to determine the distribution of leptospira serovars in humans, cattle, buffaloes, and pigs in the five regions of northern, northeastern, central, eastern and southern Thailand. The study found that serovar Shermani was the most common serovar in all species, with the highest seroprevalence in humans. Serovars Bratislava, Ranarum and Sejroe were also commonly found in humans, but had lower seroprevalence in livestock. Seropositivity against multiple serovars was most common in cattle and buffaloes. The study suggests that livestock may be a source of infection for humans, but the results indicate that a higher risk of infection is associated with exposure to the southern regions, particularly in the southern region. The study highlights the diversity of leptospira serovars in humans and livestock and suggests that the public health sector should increase awareness of high-risk groups, particularly those with close contact to infected animals or animal products. Further studies using molecular typing are recommended to confirm interspecies transmission.
The paper describes a new approach to estimate the abundance, survival rate and recruitment rate of mosquito populations in the field using mosquito mark-recapture-recapture (MR) experiments. The existing methods for doing so have limitations such as low capture efficiency, low recapture rates and short lifespan of released mosquitoes. The new approach uses Bayesian models that can account for removal of individuals due to both mortality and capture process. The models consider the number of released mosquitoes, number of days since release, and observed data to estimate abundance, survival rate and recruitment rate. The authors tested the approach using data from a mosquito MR experiment in Rio de Janeiro and found that it could estimate the abundance and survival rate reasonably well. However, the estimates of recruitment rate were sensitive to the number of immature mosquitoes collected in the field and assumptions about the pupal search. The approach could be useful for vector control strategies to evaluate the effectiveness of different methods by estimating the recruitment rate, which is important for reducing the vectorial capacity of mosquito populations. The models could also be applied to other mosquito species.
The paper discusses how mRNAs with premature termination codons (PTCs) are decayed through a process called nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) in eukaryotic cells. The NMD pathway involves a set of factors that are conserved across eukaryotes, including the Upf complex and the EJC. However, contrasting models have been proposed to explain how mRNAs with PTCs are distinguished from normal termination codons. The paper presents evidence that 3' UTR introns are neither necessary nor sufficient to trigger NMD in human cells, and that cytoplasmic PABP antagonizes NMD when positioned in proximity of a PTC. The authors propose a merged model where the balance between NMD-antagonizing and NMD-stimulating factors determines whether a translation termination event is considered premature or normal. They show that a translation termination event proximal to cytoplasmic PABP or other inhibitory factors precludes the interaction of hUpf1 with eRF3 and thus prevents NMD. However, an exon-exon junction in the 3' UTR is not sufficient for NMD. The authors suggest that a proximal cytoplasmic PABP is dominant over 3' UTR exon-exon junctions and that specific mRNAs may have evolved mechanisms to evade NMD. The paper highlights the conservation of the NMD pathway across mammals and yeast, but notes that differences exist between yeast and mammalian cells regarding when translation termination can trigger NMD.
The paper discusses how biological systems that use concentration gradients to determine positions within cells or cells can achieve positional precision. The authors analyze a simple model where a protein gradient is produced by a single source and degraded by a uniform rate. They show that to achieve good positional precision, the protein concentration must be averaged over time, as fluctuations in the concentration cannot be accurately measured from a single measurement. They find that there exists an optimal decay length for the gradient that minimizes the width of the positional distribution, and this optimal length depends on the diffusion constant and the system size. They show that subcellular gradients can achieve high precision with only a few hundred copies of the protein, while cellular gradients need more copies to achieve the same precision. They also discuss how two gradient systems can locate the center of the cell, and how nonlinear gradient decay can affect positional precision. Overall, the paper provides a simple model and analysis that can help researchers understand how biological systems use concentration gradients to determine positions.
This paper describes a study conducted in Haiti that aimed to identify areas of low transmission of lymphatic filariasis, a neglected tropical disease, in order to target areas for mass drug administration. The study found that transmission was occurring in areas that had previously been identified as having low transmission risk, suggesting that areas with low prevalence may still have transmission. The study used an index case approach where children found to be antigen positive were used as potential indicators of transmission. The researchers found that living within 20 meters of an index case significantly increased the likelihood of being antigen positive, suggesting that transmission is occurring in microfoci or small groups of close proximity. This poses a challenge for current mapping strategies and surveillance following mass drug administration. The study suggests that areas with low transmission may have foci of transmission that persist after treatment, and more sensitive diagnostic tools are needed to monitor and eliminate the remaining transmission. The study highlights the need for more comprehensive monitoring and evaluation to ensure that areas are truly free of lymphatic filariasis after treatment.
The paper discusses how different policy objectives, such as minimizing mortality and morbidity and limiting the impact on society and economy, may conflict when it comes to controlling a potential pandemic outbreak. The authors develop a mathematical model to evaluate the effectiveness of different intervention strategies based on the timing and duration of implementation. They find that interventions implemented early in the outbreak, before a pandemic vaccine is available, can be almost as effective at reducing epidemic size and peak prevalence as those implemented later, but may require holding them in place for a longer time. Interventions that minimize peak prevalence tend to be more robust to changes in the virus characteristics and can be initiated later in the outbreak. However, starting interventions too late may result in a resurgence of the epidemic after they are lifted. The paper concludes that the optimal intervention policy depends on the specific characteristics of the virus and the outbreak, and that detailed data on the costs and benefits of interventions is needed to make informed decisions. In general, it is important to define the policy objectives clearly and prioritize them to determine the best intervention strategy.
The paper describes an investigation into the genetic diversity and distribution of two mosquito species, Aedes mcintoshi and Ae. ochraceus, which are known to be important vectors of the Rift Valley fever virus in Africa. The researchers found that Ae. mcintoshi consists of at least four distinct genetic clades, while Ae. ochraceus forms two clades. Samples from Rift Valley fever outbreak areas clustered into the same clade, suggesting that the geography and ecology of the areas may influence the distribution of the mosquitoes and their ability to transmit the virus. The paper suggests that Ae. ochraceus may have expanded its range and become a more important vector of the virus in recent times, contributing to more explosive outbreaks in Kenya. The findings highlight the genetic complexity of the two mosquito species and the importance of studying their populations to better understand and predict the spread of Rift Valley fever.
The paper discusses how the temporal response of genes to a Notch signaling pathway can provide insights into the underlying regulatory mechanisms. The authors analyzed gene expression changes within 15 minutes of Notch activation in Drosophila cells using a short pulse of EDTA treatment. They found that genes could be stratified into different response profiles based on their rapid or delayed response to the signal. The rapid responders, mainly from the E(spl) complex, exhibited a rapid recruitment of Pol II and Su(H) binding. In contrast, the delayed responders showed more delayed Su(H) binding and had lower Pol II binding at the start. The authors propose a model where early responding E(spl) genes inhibit the expression of repressor genes, such as Hairy, which then enables the delayed response of late responding genes. This feed-forward repression model could explain why mutations in E(spl) genes can phenocopy Notch knockdown. The study also shows that Su(H) binding and Pol II binding alone are not sufficient to guarantee a response from neighboring genes, suggesting additional mechanisms are involved. The authors propose that hairy repression by early targets may be the key factor that enables the delayed response of late responding genes.
The paper discusses how primate lentiviruses can adapt to new hosts by acquiring genetic changes that allow them to use host cell surface receptors more efficiently. The authors found that a specific amino acid change in the HIV-1 envelope protein at position 28 can improve the ability of the virus to use host CD4 proteins, which are found on T cells. This change was found to be common in viruses that adapted in primates, but not in viruses that adapted in cell culture. The authors suggest that this adaptation allows the viruses to better use CD4 proteins found on T cells in primate hosts, which is necessary for efficient replication in primate cells. The paper demonstrates that introducing this change in the HIV-1 envelope protein can improve the ability of the virus to replicate in primate cells, but does not change its neutralization properties. This finding could help researchers generate new primate-adapted HIV strains that can more accurately model human HIV infection and be used for vaccine development.
The paper describes a protein called Rok that helps prevent bacteria from acquiring new genetic material from other bacteria. Rok is found in the bacteria Bacillus subtilis and is similar to a protein called H-NS found in Gram-negative bacteria. Rok binds to regions of the bacterial chromosome that have high A+T content, which is associated with genetic material that has been acquired from other bacteria. Rok helps repress the expression of genes that allow bacteria to take up new genetic material, and also binds to genetic material itself to prevent excision. The authors found that Rok is specific in its binding to regions of high A+T content and not just general A+T-rich DNA. They propose that Rok is functionally similar to H-NS and LSR2 proteins found in Gram-negative bacteria and may be an analogue of H-NS in Gram-positive bacteria. Rok helps prevent bacteria from acquiring new genetic material that is high in A+T content, which can be harmful to the cell.
The paper discusses the role of a histone demethylase enzyme called KDM6A in regulating the expression of certain genes called Rhox6 and Rhox9, which are important for sexual development and reproduction. KDM6A is found to specifically regulate the expression of these genes in female cells, particularly in the early embryo and ovary, but not in male cells. KDM6A is encoded by an X-linked gene that escapes X-inactivation in female cells, leading to higher expression in females. The authors show that KDM6A is recruited to the promoters of Rhox6 and 9 in female but not male ES cells, leading to the removal of a repressive histone mark called H3K27me3 and increased expression in female cells. The study finds that KDM6A occupancy is high at the promoters of Rhox6 and 9 in the ovary, suggesting that it plays a role in keeping these genes active. The results suggest that escape from X-inactivation of KDM6A may be favorable for Rhox6 and 9 expression in the ovary, which is important for female reproduction. The study also finds that KDM6A is needed for proper ovarian function. The authors propose that other histone demethylases may also regulate the expression of other Rhox genes in a dose-dependent manner. The study provides evidence that Rhox6 and 9 are regulated by KDM6A in a sex-specific manner, which is important for female reproduction.
The paper describes how the yeast species Ogata polymorpha switches its mating type between haploid and diploid in response to environmental conditions. The researchers found that the mechanism of mating-type switching in Ogata polymorpha is different from that in other yeast species like Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In Ogata polymorpha, mating-type switching is induced by a nitrogen depletion signal, which activates a pathway involving the gene EFG1. The EFG1 gene is required upstream of the mating response gene RME1, which in turn activates the mating pathway. Overexpression of EFG1 is sufficient to induce mating-type switching, but it requires additional factors like RME1 and STE12. The researchers identified several genes required for mating-type switching, including EFG1, RME1, STE12, and some white-opaque genes. They also found that the homologous recombination pathway is involved in mating-type switching, but the intermediate steps connecting EFG1 to RME1 remain unknown. They propose a model for how mating-type switching and the mating response to pheromone are controlled in Ogata polymorpha, which involves a positive feedback loop between EFG1 and RME1.
The paper investigates the disassembly of hepatitis B virus (HBV) capsids in cells. The authors used digiton-permeabilized cells to simulate the nuclear import of HBV genome, which allows them to distinguish between capsid assembly and disassembly. They found that HBV capsids disassemble into core protein dimers upon nuclear import, which then reassemble into mature capsids. This disassembly is mediated by the removal of the encapsidated DNA. The authors conclude that the capsids assemble from core proteins via dimer and hexamer formation, and that the nuclear basket at the nuclear pore provides the environment for capsid disintegration and genome release. The time at which the polymerase-RNA complex interacts with the capsid subassemblies has to be left, but may enhance the assembly reaction. The authors propose that core protein dimers derived from disassembled capsids diffuse deeper into the nucleus, allowing capsid formation when the concentration of nuclear core proteins reaches a certain threshold.
The paper describes the identification of a transcription factor called ATF-7 that regulates the immune response in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. The researchers found that the activity of a transcription factor called p38 MAPK (also known as p38 MAPK) in the worms leads to the expression of ATF-7, which in turn regulates the immune response. When p38 MAPK activity is reduced, ATF-7 activity is also reduced, leading to a weakened immune response. The researchers identified four mutants of ATF-7 that showed different effects on the immune response, suggesting that ATF-7 acts as both a repressor and activator of the immune response. They found that ATF-7 physically interacts with activated p38 MAPK and is phosphorylated by it, leading to changes in its activity. The results suggest that the regulation of ATF-7 by p38 MAPK is important for the worms' immune response to pathogens like Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The study provides insights into how the immune system is regulated in ancestral organisms and may help explain why mammalian ATF2/CREB5 transcription factors have a role in immunity.
The paper discusses how the FOXO transcription factors, specifically FOXO3, regulate the expansion and maintenance of CD8 T cell memory. CD8 T cells are generated during an immune response to foreign antigens through a clonal expansion phase and contraction phase. FOXO3 has been shown to regulate the expansion of CD8 T cells through cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The study found that global and conditional FOXO3 knockout mice have increased clonal expansion of CD8 T cells during an acute LCMV infection, without affecting their function or quality. This suggests that FOXO3 regulates CD8 T cell expansion by T cell intrinsic mechanisms. The study also found that the increase in CD8 T cells in FOXO3 knockout mice was primarily observed in the spleen, and not in lymph nodes or liver. The increased CD8 T cell number in the spleen was not due to increased proliferation, but was instead due to reduced cellular apoptosis. The study suggests that FOXO3 may regulate CD8 T cell homeostasis by controlling apoptosis during the clonal expansion and contraction phases. The findings have implications for vaccine development as modulating FOXO3 activity during the expansion phase may boost CD8 T cell memory and protective immunity.
This paper discusses how parasites in malaria infections can have different strategies for allocating resources between within hosts and transmission to new hosts. The authors show that current methods for estimating transmission investment from time series data are often inaccurate and produce spurious patterns. They develop a new approach that models the dynamics of parasite proliferation and transmission within hosts by incorporating effective propagation numbers, which describe the invasion success per infected red blood cell, and account for gametocyte carryover. By fitting this model to simulated and real time series data, the authors find that transmission investment varies across individuals and can be biased by gametocyte carryover. The new method shows that some parasites allocate more resources to proliferation rather than transmission, revealing more diverse transmission strategies than previously thought. The approach is sensitive to assumptions about gametocyte longevity and immune response, but is able to reveal intriguing patterns of transmission investment in real infections. The findings suggest that estimating transmission investment is a more challenging problem than previously appreciated, especially for parasites with long transmission stages.
This paper investigated how the Drosophila embryo's epithelial morphogenesis is orchestrated at the cellular level through local shape and tissue dynamics during embryonic development. The authors found that cell signaling plays an essential role in coordinating gene expression during this process. They identified a new set of genes that are specifically expressed in the dorsal ectoderm during embryonic closure (DC), and analyzed their expression patterns using transcriptome analysis. They found that the expression of some genes is regulated by both the JNK signaling pathway and the HOX genes, which control segmental features along the anterior-posterior axis. The HOX genes collaborate with JNK to control the expression of genes in the lateral ectoderm, leading to a complex transcriptional response in the epidermal morphogenetic domain. The results show that the LE acts as a morphogenetic domain and provides an active boundary for the tissue, driving epidermal spreading and seamless tissue sealing during DC. The LE is also regulated by multiple signaling layers, including the JNK pathway, HOX genes, and tissue dynamics along the AP axis. This multi-layered regulatory model allows for precise control of cellular behaviors important for tissue morphogenesis.
The paper describes a new mechanism for the accumulation of a prion protein called PrPSc in neurons during prion diseases. PrPSc accumulation is thought to be the primary cause of prion diseases, but the exact mechanism is not well understood. The authors found that the protein sortilin, a member of the VPS10P sorting receptor family, plays a key role in sorting PrPC and PrPSc to lysosomes for degradation. Sortilin interacts with PrPC on the cell surface and sorts it to lysosomes, reducing PrPC levels in raft domains. PrPSc accumulation reduces sortilin levels, which in turn disturbs its function to sort PrPC and PrPSc to lysomes. This results in increased PrPC levels and PrPSc accumulation. The reduction of sortilin also disturbs its function to sort PrPSc to lysomes, leading to further PrPSc accumulation. The authors showed that sortilin deficiency in mice accelerates PrPSc accumulation, leading to faster disease progression. The results suggest that sortilin-mediated lysosomal degradation of PrPC and PrPSc could be a therapeutic target for prion diseases.
The paper discusses how the bacteria Brucella melitensis, which causes brucellosis, induces a unfolded protein response (UPR) in macrophages in order to support its intracellular replication. The UPR is a host response to bacterial infection that involves the activation of various cellular pathways that help protect cells from stress caused by bacterial infection. The bacteria expresses a weak lipopolysaccharide that triggers some UPR signaling pathways, but not others. The study found that the bacteria's surface protein TcpB, which induces cytoskeleton disruption, also induces the UPR in macrophages. This induction of UPR likely enables the bacteria to replicate inside the macrophages. The UPR mobilizes cellular resources, including amino acid transport and folding capacity, supports bacterial replication and growth, and allows the cell to cope with stress caused by bacterial infection. The study suggests that the UPR plays an active role in supporting bacterial replication. The UPR may also have implications for understanding how other bacteria that establish an intracellular niche interact with the endoplasmic reticulum.
The paper discusses the results of a study on the distribution and abundance of Trypanosoma brucei gambien, the vector tsetse fly, and human and animal hosts in the mangrove habitats of Boffa in Guinea. The study found that while tsetse flies are present and actively transmitting Trypanosoma brucei gambien to humans, they are not infected with pathogenic trypanosomes. However, only one domestic animal, a pig, was found to be infected. The study suggests that vectorial capacity of Glossina palpalis gambiensis, the tset fly, in this focus is very low. The human population is young, mobile, and only 40% of the population attended the medical survey, indicating that transmission of the disease is likely occurring at the mangrove/avannah interface where people are exposed to tset flies during activities such as rice cultivation, salt extraction, fishing, etc. The results suggest that vector control targeting tset flies, rather than eradication of tset flies, is likely the most effective way to reduce transmission and protect people from Trypanosoma brucei gambien infections. The study advocates for an integrated strategy of medical surveillance and vector control to eliminate Trypanosoma brucei gambien in mangrove foci.
The paper describes a study on community-directed treatment with ivermectin (CDTI) for onchocerciasis in Cameroon. CDTI is an approach where communities select and motivate distributors of ivermectin, a drug used to treat onchocercias. The study found that CDTI implementation in the study areas had several weaknesses, including: 1) communities were not fully involved in planning and decision making, 2) sensitization of communities was inadequate, 3) there were insufficient health workers, 4) funding issues, 5) lack of community support, and 6) transportation challenges. These weaknesses led to low adherence to ivermectin treatment among community members. The study suggests that CDTI projects should focus more on community participation and empowerment, better sensitization, adequate training and supervision, and integration of CDTI with other health interventions. The CDTI approach has the potential to be an effective strategy for controlling onchocercias in Africa, especially in rural and poor communities. However, it requires careful planning, implementation and follow-up to achieve its goals.
The paper describes a new real-time RT-PCR assay called the LN34 assay that can detect all known species of Lyssavirus, the virus that causes rabies. The assay targets a conserved region of the N gene and uses degenerate primers and probes to overcome the limitations of other real-time RT-PCR assays that are less sensitive. The LN34 assay was validated using a diverse panel of samples representing different rabies variants and was shown to be more sensitive than conventional RT-PCR and DFA. The assay can detect samples with low levels of viral RNA, allowing it to diagnose rabies in samples that are unsuitable for DFA testing or have been stored for long periods of time. The high sensitivity and low risk of false positives make the LN34 assay a promising tool for improving rabies diagnostics, especially in resource limited settings where sample quality and availability can be issues.
The paper describes a study that aimed to identify epigenetic variations that may contribute to the development of type 1 diabetes, a complex autoimmune disease affecting over 30 million people worldwide. The researchers used monozygotic twins to identify epigenetic variations that could not be explained by genetic differences between the twins. They found 58 epigenetic variations (called T1D-MVPs) that were hypermethylated (more methylated) in the twin with type 1 diabetes compared to the healthy twin. These T1D-MVPs were confirmed using pyrosequencing and bisulfite PCR analysis. The T1D-MVPs were also found to precede clinical diagnosis and were stable over many years. The study showed that the T1D-MVPs could not be explained by environmental factors like diet, insulin treatment or autoantibodies. The findings provide a new approach for identifying disease-associated epigenetic variations that antedate clinical disease, which could help elucidate the etiology of type 1 diabetes. The researchers suggest that the temporal origins of the T1D-MVPs need to be studied to determine if they arise before or after the autoantibody response. The study also highlights the need to investigate the functional impact of the T1D-MVPs on gene expression and chromatin structure.
The paper discusses the molecular mechanism by which the fusion protein HAP2 mediates gamete fusion in plants. The protein HAP2 has been identified in multiple eukaryotic organisms, but its structure and mechanism of action have only recently been proposed. The authors studied the HAP2 structures from Arabidopsis thaliana and Trypanosoma cruzi, finding that while the overall structure is conserved, the membrane interaction surfaces at the domain II tip are highly diverse across different organisms. Arabidopsis has a single fusion loop that projects an amphipathic helix, while T. cruzi has three short loops. The authors found that the nonpolar residues on the amphipathic helix in Arabidopsis are essential for membrane insertion in vitro and in vivo, and that the helical nature of the helix is conserved across flowering plants. They also showed that the amphipathic helix can be replaced with an amphipathic helix from rice, indicating plasticity in the interaction between HAP2 and its target membranes. The high diversity in the membrane interaction surfaces of HAP2 across different organisms suggests that female gametes may have evolved specific lipid compositions important for gamete fusion. The results provide evidence that HAP2 functions by direct membrane insertion and that the mechanism of gamete fusion is likely similar to that of viral class II fusion proteins, where the protein inserts into the target membrane via the fusion loops.
This paper describes a study that investigated how a protein called Zip1 helps coordinate the formation of crossovers between homologous chromosomes during meiosis in budding yeast. Zip1 has two distinct functions: promoting crossovers and assembling the synapsis complex (SC). The researchers found that two parts of Zip1's amino acid sequence correspond to its crossover promoting and SC assembly functions, and that the two parts are functionally separable. They identified two Zip1 mutants that have a separation-of-function phenotype: one has robust SC assembly but lacks crossovers, while the other has crossovers but lacks SC assembly. They propose that Zip1's first 20 amino acids interact with a protein called Zip3, which is also involved in crossovers, to help coordinate these two functions. Zip3 localizes to sites where crossovers are formed and also interacts with the central element of the SC. The researchers found that Zip1's first 20 amino acids are essential for Zip3's recruitment to these sites and for Zip3's SUMOylation of the central SC element. They propose that Zip1 interfaces with Zip3 in a way that is dependent on other proteins and molecular structures, rather than a direct interaction. This interaction helps coordinate the timing of crossover formation and SC assembly.
The paper proposes a new approach to understanding how the auditory cortex processes sound. The authors argue that traditional models that assume linear combinations of structural primitives and sparse coding do not accurately reflect how the auditory cortex processes complex sound. Instead, they propose a model called Maximal Causes Analysis (MCA) that uses a nonlinear interaction of primitives to combine them. The MCA model is able to handle a large number of primitives, which is consistent with how complex sounds are composed. The authors show that the MCA model is able to generate receptive fields that exhibit punctate excitation and inhibition, which are similar to those observed in real auditory neurons. They also find that inhibitory subfields of the model receptive fields can emerge as a consequence of "explaining away" effects, which are a result of the statistical model. This suggests that assumptions about statistical inference and learning in the auditory cortex may be responsible for inhibitory subfields. The study provides evidence that inhibitory subfields can emerge without assuming a whitening step, which has been a longstanding assumption in the literature. The findings offer a new perspective on how the auditory cortex processes complex sounds and may lead to new tools for evaluating assumptions about statistical inference in the brain.
This paper investigated how the hippocampus processes information related to objects and their locations. The authors used a memory task to test mice's ability to distinguish between objects and their locations. They found that the parts of the hippocampus that are sensitive to spatial information (proximal CA1 and CA3) and temporal information (distal CA1) are tuned to processing these different types of information in different ways. Proximal CA1 is more sensitive to spatial information, while distal CA1 is more sensitive to temporal information. Distal CA1 showed a stronger recruitment of temporal information when the mice were asked to discriminate between the temporal aspect of the memory (when the objects were presented), while proximal CA1 showed a stronger recruitment of spatial information. The authors suggest that the traditional view of the hippocampus processing information in a segregated manner, with spatial and non-spatial subnetworks, may be compatible with their findings. Proximal CA1 and CA3 are more sensitive to spatial information, while distal CA1 is sensitive to temporal information. This suggests that the hippocampus processes spatial and temporal information in a segregated manner, but the same neural networks may be recruited when both dimensions are retrieved. The results provide evidence for the idea that the hippocampus processes spatial and non-spatial information in a segregated manner, but also show that the two subnetworks may be connected in a way that allows for integration of the information when both dimensions are relevant.
The paper describes a new method for measuring the entry and release of outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) from bacteria into host cells. The authors developed a novel assay that uses a genetically encoded probe that is incorporated into the bacterial outer membrane and targeted to the OMV surface, and a cell-permeable dye that is cleaved upon OMV entry. The assay allows for high-sensitivity and real-time detection of OMV entry into host cells. They used the assay to study the entry kinetics of OMVs from different E. coli strains and found that the length of the LPS antigen on the OMV surface determines the entry efficiency, with longer LPS antigens allowing faster entry. The authors also found that OMVs lacking LPS antigens require protein receptors for entry and utilize clathrin-mediated endocytosis as the main route, while OMVs with LPS antigens access raft-mediated endocytosis more efficiently. The results suggest that the presence of LPS antigens on OMVs enhances OMV entry into host cells, which may contribute to bacterial pathogenesis. The method could be used to study the role of OMVs in bacterial infection and potentially lead to new vaccine development.
This paper found that exposure to certain chemicals called perfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) in adults is associated with greater weight gain, especially in women, during a controlled weight loss trial. The study found that higher baseline levels of PFASs were associated with more weight gain during the follow-up period between 6 and 24 months, especially among women. The findings suggest that environmental chemicals may play a role in the current obesity epidemic, as PFASs may suppress the body's ability to maintain a healthy weight. The study controlled for factors like diet, exercise, and thyroid hormone levels, and found that the associations remained significant even when adjusting for potential confounding variables. The study provides evidence that higher baseline PFAS levels are associated with slower regression of resting metabolic rate, which is a key determinant of weight maintenance. The study highlights the need for further research to understand the mechanisms underlying the link between PFAS exposure and weight regulation in humans.
This paper investigates how the bacteria Chlamydia trachomatis activates the inflammasome in macrophages. The authors find that Chlamydia trachomatis replication or metabolism within macrophages is necessary for inflammasome activation, as evidenced by increased IL-1β secretion and cell death. They identify two distinct pathways for inflammasome activation: canonical inflammasome activation through TLR4/TLR4 and non-canonical inflammasome activation through caspase-1 and cyclic di-AMP. They propose that the non-canonical inflammasome requires the detection of cyclic di-AMP by STING, which in turn activates type-1 interferon signalling and upregulates IRGs and GBPs. In contrast, canonical inflammasome activation requires the release of host DNA by TLR4/TLR4. The authors also find that the bacteria's ability to modulate cyclic di-AMP production may provide a mechanism of immune evasion and contribute to latency. Targeting the STING/interferon pathway may provide useful vaccine adjuvants and therapeutic targets to treat Chlamydia trachomatis infection and its associated inflammatory pathology. Overall, the study suggests that detecting and regulating the production of cyclic di-AMP by Chlamydia trachomatis may be a key strategy for controlling inflammasome activation and immune evasion.
This paper describes how the miRNA miR-263a/b contributes to the development and survival of sense organs in the Drosophila eye. miR-263a/b mutants have defects in the formation of external sense organs like the interomidial bristles, or IOB. The mutants show a stochastic loss of IOB cells, unlike the consistent loss of individual cells in normal conditions. The authors propose that miR-263a/b acts as a buffer to prevent apoptosis in the developing eye during a process of interomidial cell pruning. This pruning process is inherently stochastic, with the loss of individual cells occurring randomly. The miRNA protects the sense organs by limiting the activity of the pro-apoptotic gene hid, which induces apoptosis in the cells. Only the gene hid was identified as a direct target of miR-263a/b in vivo. The results suggest that miR-263a/b acts in a regulatory feedforward network to control hid activity, indirectly through the Ras/MAPK pathway. miR-263a/b has a high buffering capacity to ensure the robustness of the IOB formation process, allowing it to function in a fluctuating developmental landscape. The authors propose that this mechanism of miRNA activity may be a general feature of developmental systems that confer robustness.
The study found that a basic lymphedema management program that emphasized hygiene and skin care, along with education on self-care practices, was effective in reducing the incidence of acute dermatolymphangitis (ADLA) episodes in patients with lymphedema of the leg in a resource-poor area where lymphatic filariasis is endemic. While some patients experienced some reduction in leg volume, the main goal of reducing volume was not the most effective way to reduce ADLA episodes. The program focused on hygiene practices like washing, elevating the leg, and exercising, which were found to significantly reduce ADLA incidence. The study suggests that self-care education and motivation are key to lymedema management, but compression bandages, which were initially emphasized, were found to increase ADLA episodes. The program evolved over time as staff gained experience and messages became clearer. The study suggests that while lymphedema volume reduction is an objective measure, it is not the most important goal in resource-poor settings, as it does not adequately capture the impact on ADLA frequency. The program's success shows that basic lymphedema management is feasible and effective in resource-poor areas, but more intensive effort may be needed for patients with literacy or advanced disease.
The paper discusses how gene drive systems that can spread desirable traits through mosquito populations could potentially be used to control mosquito-borne diseases. The paper presents a mathematical model that can be used to study the effects of various ecological factors, such as population size, larval competition, mortality rates, and migration rates, on the efficacy of two types of gene drive systems: underdominance (UD) and killer-rescue (KR). The model shows that while population size does not significantly affect the final outcome of the gene drives, density dependence can significantly alter the dynamics. The model also considers the effects of releasing transgenic mosquitoes into target and non-target populations, showing how different outcomes may occur depending on the release ratio and genetic traits of the transgenes. The results suggest that while the gene drives may not completely eliminate mosquito populations, they could potentially achieve stable, high frequency transgene presence in the target population while keeping transgene frequencies low in the non-target population. This could help control virus transmission. However, the model makes assumptions about mosquito mating and population size, which may be refined through experiments. Further research could also consider how to account for mutations and resistance, as well as the impact of competition between mosquito populations. Overall, the study demonstrates the feasibility of using gene drives to control mosquito-borne diseases and highlights the importance of studying the effects of ecological factors on their efficacy.
The paper describes the development of a new open-source platform called EmbryoPhenics that enables the automated and high-throughput measurement of phenotypes in aquatic embryos. The platform consists of an open-source microscope called OpenVIM that can acquire images of developing embryos over long periods of time, and a software package called EmbryoCV that analyzes the video data to extract and integrate large amounts of data. The EmbryoCV software can quantify phenotypes such as morphology, physiology, and behavior of individual embryos as well as proxy measures like heart rate and energy levels. The authors demonstrate the platform by using it to study the effects of temperature and salinity on two species of aquatic embryos, Radix balthica and Orchestia gammareus. They show that EmbryoCV can accurately measure phenotypes in both species, including complex cardiac function, and identify lethal end points like time to death. The platform is versatile and extendible to different species and study designs, and the authors hope that it will facilitate the generation of high-dimensional data that can help us better understand embryonic development and responses to environmental stressors.
The paper discusses the discovery of ancient viral sequences, called endogenous hepadnaviruses, within the genomes of turtles, snakes, and crocodiles. These viruses date back to at least 207 million years ago and provide evidence that viruses coexisted with their host species at least since the Early Mesozoic Era. The study found that hepadnaviruses, which include the hepatitis B virus, have remained relatively unchanged in their genome organization over millions of years, including the absence of an X gene that is present in mammalian hepadnaviruses. The X gene is thought to be involved in liver tumor formation. The study suggests that the ancestor of hepadnaviruses lacked the X gene and that it emerged de novo in the Orthohepadirus lineage. The study also found that the non-avian endogenous hepadnaviruses are at least 30 million years old, providing evidence that hepadnaviruses coexisted with their amniote hosts at least since the Early Mesozoic Era. However, the lack of endogenous hepadnaviruses in mammal genomes despite thousands of available genome sequences is puzzling. The study proposes that the lack of evidence may be due to faster molecular evolution in mammal genomes, which could have erased the evidence for fixed hepadvirus endogenization.
The paper discusses the results of a mathematical modeling study on the effects of interleukin-7 (IL-7) therapy on CD4 T cell counts in HIV-infected patients. The study found that while IL-7 therapy initially leads to a rapid increase in CD4 T cell counts, the increase is not solely due to peripheral proliferation but also involves a lingering effect on CD4 T cell survival. The modeling showed that IL-7 administration resulted in a decrease in CD4 T cell loss, leading to a slower decline in CD4 T cell counts over time. This suggests that repeated IL-7 injections could potentially maintain CD4 T cell counts above 50 cells/mL for prolonged periods of time. However, the study did not consider the long-term effects of IL-7 therapy and the potential impact on thymic output. Further clinical trials are needed to confirm the findings and determine the optimal IL-7 dosing and schedule for CD4 T cell restoration in HIV patients.
This paper investigated the role of monocytes in Plasmodium vivax malaria, a species of malaria that is responsible for most malaria cases in Latin America and Southeast Asia. The authors found that monocytes, a type of white blood cell, are activated and produce pro-inflammatory cytokines during malaria infection. They identified three subtypes of monocytes: classical (CD14+CD16-), intermediate (CD14+CD16+), and patrolling (CD14loCD16+). The CD14+CD16+ monocytes had the highest levels of mitochondria and reactive oxygen species, indicating they were most active and efficient at phagocytosing infected red blood cells. CD14+CD16+ monocytes also produced the most TNF-alpha, indicating they played a key role in controlling parasite growth. The authors suggest that CD14+CD16+ monocytes are activated and inflammatory, while patrolling monocytes are less activated and more involved in patrolling the blood vessels. The study suggests that activated monocytes are characteristic of acute malaria and likely play an important role in controlling parasite growth and symptoms during the disease. Further research on the different monocyte subtypes could lead to identifying specific targets for therapeutic intervention in this neglected disease.
The paper discusses how CD4+ T cells, not just CD8+ T cells, can protect against typhus fever, a disease caused by the bacteria Rickettsia typhi. The authors showed that CD4+ T cells enter the brain and spinal cord of mice infected with R. typhi, infiltrate microglia and activate them, and also produce IFNγ which activates microglia to eliminate the bacteria. They found that CD4+ T cells are as effective as CD8+ T cells in protecting against R. typhi infection and preventing recurrence of disease, even in mice that have already developed symptoms. This suggests that CD4+ T cell-inducing vaccination could be as effective as inducing a CD8+ T cell response in protecting against typhus fever.
This paper discusses the discovery of two mechanisms by which Vibrio choleraeae, the bacteria that causes cholera, can vary the expression of its outer membrane protein called the O1 antigen. The O1 antigen is important for the bacteria's protection from antibiotics and the immune system. The bacteria has evolved two genes that allow it to switch between two different forms of the protein, called wbeL and manA, which are found in different parts of the genome. The wbeL form of the gene produces a lower molecular weight O1 antigen that allows the bacteria to resist infection by certain phages. The manA form of the gene produces a full length O1 antigen. The bacteria can switch between these forms through two different mechanisms: a frameshift mutation in the wbeL gene and a deletion in the manA gene. The paper shows that these phase variations are selected for in the environment, particularly through predation by phages that target the O1 antigen. The bacteria can thus have different forms of the O1 antigen in different populations, which allows some to be resistant to phages while still producing the full length antigen that is needed for colonization of the small intestine. This phase variation likely plays a key role in the bacteria's ability to persist in different environments and evade the immune system.
The paper discusses how Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacteria that causes tuberculosis, evades the host' immune response to persist in the lungs for the lifetime of the infected individual. The authors found that even though the immune system mounts a strong response involving CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and cytokines like interferon gamma (IFN-γ) during tuberculosis infection, the bacteria still survives. They found that a small number of CD4+ effector T cells are activated in the lungs, but the number of activated cells decreases over time, even as the bacterial burden remains high. They suggest that this is due to the bacteria limiting the availability of antigen for these T cells, rather than the T cells themselves being ineffective. They propose that the bacteria reduce the expression of a gene called fbpB during chronic infection, which limits the availability of antigen for effector T cells. Providing exogenous antigen through peptide injections can increase the number of activated effector T cells and reduce bacterial burden in the lungs, indicating that enhancing effector T cell activation is an important factor in controlling tuberculosis infection. The authors suggest that suboptimal activation of effector T cells, likely due to bacterial and host mechanisms, limits the immune response and allows the bacteria to persist in the lungs.
The paper describes a study on the genetics of Plasmodium vivax malaria in the Peruvian Amazon. Researchers analyzed 292 parasite isolates from five areas around Iquitos, including Iquitos city and neighboring villages. They found that most parasites were monoclonal, indicating that transmission occurs mainly through clonal propagation. Areas with higher human mobility, such as Iquitos city, had a higher proportion of polyclonal infections. The study found evidence of recent bottleneck events in areas where malaria control programs were implemented before the sample collection, indicating that these areas had a smaller effective parasite population size. The results suggest that clonal propagation is the predominant transmission mechanism in the Peruvian Amazon, with areas close to Iquitos serving as sources of parasite spread. The findings provide information on the routes of malaria transmission and the impact of control policies on the parasite population, which can inform future control strategies.
The paper discusses the structure and function of a protein called RapJ, which is involved in cell signaling in bacteria. RapJ is a repeat protein that can be inhibited by a small peptide called PhrC. The researchers found that when RapJ is inhibited by PhrC, it changes its structure and loses its ability to regulate other proteins. They determined the structure of RapJ-PhrC complex using X-ray crystallography and found that RapJ changes from a linear conformation to a bent conformation when inhibited. This bent conformation creates new intramolecular contacts that are necessary for PhrC to inhibit RapJ. They propose that RapJ's ability to change its structure in response to PhrC is an example of a general mechanism of repeat proteins, which can undergo large conformational changes. They also propose that RapJ could be used as a scaffold for engineering new ligand-switchable affinity reagents.
The paper describes a new approach to inferring the evolutionary history and spatial patterns of viruses using a Bayesian phylogeographic framework. This approach combines Bayesian inference with a discrete-time Markov chain model to simulate the spread of viruses over space and time. The model allows researchers to incorporate information from multiple genomic segments without assuming a single evolutionary history for each segment. The approach uses a Bayesian Stochastic Variable Selection (BSS) method to identify the most parsimonious description of the phylogenetic diffusion process, which can identify epidemiological links between locations. The authors apply the approach to two viruses, Avian influenza H5N1 and rabies, to study their evolution and spatial dispersion. The results provide insights into the spatial history of the viruses and the epidemiological links between different locations. The approach is able to reconstruct the migration paths over time and infer the most likely root locations for the viruses. The results show that the root locations inferred using BSS are consistent with the observed spatial patterns of the virus diffusion. The approach also highlights the advantages of using Bayesian inference over parsimony analysis in terms of being able to incorporate both phylogenetic and spatial uncertainty and account for branch lengths in the reconstructions. The paper demonstrates the ability to perform ancestral state reconstruction, location reconstruction and hypothesis testing in a single model, making it a valuable tool for studying the evolutionary history and epidemiology of viruses.
The paper discusses how the inheritance of the X chromosome in aphids and the presence of asexual reproduction in the life cycle leads to different genetic conflicts between males and females. In aphids, the X chromosome is expected to accumulate sexually antagonistic alleles that benefit males, while the autosomes accumulate alleles that benefit asexual females. The authors show through modeling and experiments that this leads to a masculinization of the X chromosome and an "asexualization" of the autosomes, with more male-biased genes on the X and more asexual female-biased genes on the autosomes. This suggests that the evolution of sex-biased gene expression may have solved intra-locus sexual conflicts. The study highlights the importance of organisms with unusual modes of inheritance of sex chromosomes, like aphids and nematodes, for understanding the evolution of sex chromosomes.
The paper describes a study on how a chromatin remodeler called SWI/SNF5 regulates stem cell differentiation. The authors found that SWI/SNF5 plays a critical role in controlling the balance between stem cell pluripotency and differentiation. In pluripotent cells, SWI/SNF5 helps maintain the open chromatin structure of genes required for stem cell self-renewal by repressing genes that are activated by another transcription factor called Oct4. When stem cells differentiate, SWI/SNF5 helps establish closed chromatin structures that allow for the activation of genes required for differentiation. Loss of SWI/SNF5 disrupts the balance between pluripotency and differentiation, leading to cell death. Overexpression of SWI/SNF5 leads to premature differentiation. The study shows that SWI/SNF5 plays a dual role in regulating genes that are activated by Oct4 and genes that are repressed by Oct4, and that its changes in chromatin structure are critical for its function. The findings provide new insights into how chromatin remodeling complexes contribute to stem cell differentiation and regenerative medicine.
The paper examines the ability of two mosquito species, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, to transmit the chikungunya virus in Florida. The study found that both species were able to transmit the virus, but there were some differences in how well they did so depending on the specific virus strain and the location of the mosquito. Aedes aegypti was found to be more efficient at transmitting the Indian Ocean strain of the virus, while Aedes albopictus was more efficient at transmitting the Asian lineage. However, the study also found that transmission rates were lower for Aedes aegypti from the Dominican Republic, which suggests that other factors such as human biting rates may play a larger role in transmission. The study highlights the need for further research into the vector competence of these mosquito species in different regions and how it can affect the risk of transmission.
This paper investigated how intestinal worm infections affect the immune system, particularly the skin lymph nodes. The researchers found that when mice are infected with the intestinal worm H. polygyrus, their skin lymph nodes lose cellularity and become smaller. This is thought to be due to the worms causing a redistribution of circulating lymphocytes to the enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes, which then become larger. This results in the skin lymph nodes having less available cells to respond to skin infections like BCG vaccination. The reduction in skin lymphocytes is thought to be due to the larger lymph nodes retaining more circulating cells. The researchers suggest that this redistribution of lymphocytes is the main reason why intestinal worm infections can suppress the immune system's ability to respond to skin infections. The study also found that deworming the mice can restore skin lymph node cellularity and responses to BCG vaccination, but it takes time for the skin lymph nodes to fully recover. This suggests that deworming may be a strategy to improve immunity to vaccines in areas where high worm burdens are present.
According to the paper, the researchers found that the drug metformin, which is commonly used to treat type 2 diabetes, can inhibit the dengue virus (DENV) by inhibiting an enzyme called HMGCR. They found that DENV infection reduces the activity of the enzyme AMPK, which in turn leads to an increase in HMGCR activity. This increase in HMGCR activity leads to an accumulation of cholesterol in the replication complexes needed for DENV replication. Metformin, which inhibits HMGCR activity, showed a significant antiviral effect against DENV by reducing viral protein levels, viral yield, and genome copies. These results suggest that AMPK modulation is a new potential target for dengue treatment.
The paper describes a new mouse model that allows researchers to study the role of the protein Dek in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) development and progression. Dek is a protein that is overexpressed in many types of cancer, including ESCC. The researchers created mice that can conditionally express Dek in keratinocytes in the squamous epithelium of the esophagus and tongue, targeting the basal layer. They found that when they exposed the mice to a chemical carcinogen called 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4NQO), mice that overexpressed Dek had a higher incidence of gross esophageal tumors compared to mice that did not, suggesting that Dek overexpression promotes esophage SCC growth. The study shows that even a relatively modest increase in Dek protein levels in epithelial cells is sufficient to promote tumor growth and proliferation. This mouse model provides a valuable tool for studying the role of Dek in ESCC development and progression, and may help identify potential therapeutic targets for treating ESCC.
This paper explores how different models of gene action and population demography can influence the genetic architecture of complex diseases. The authors simulate a 100 kilobase region of the human genome experiencing deleterious mutations, recombination, selection, and drift over time. They analyze how different models of gene action, such as the gene-based recessive model, can explain the distribution of minor allele frequencies and heritability estimates from genome-wide association studies. They find that the gene-based recessive model, which assumes that recessive mutations fail to complement within a gene region, can explain the observed distribution of minor allele frequencies and heritability estimates, while other models like the additive codominant and multiplicative recessive models fail to do so. The results suggest that population growth increases the contribution of rare alleles to genetic variance, which can be detected by rare variant association tests, but current methods are not very powerful. The paper argues that the genetic model and population demography drive the relationship between genetic variation and allele frequency, and that different models of gene action and demography can predict different patterns of genetic variance. The results have implications for the design and interpretation of genome-wide association studies.
The paper investigates how genes in the multipartite genome of the soybean microsymbiont Sinorhizium fredii are organized and integrated in response to different environmental conditions. The study found that genes on the chromosome and chromid are more highly connected to each other than genes on the symbiosis plasmid under different conditions, suggesting that the chromid plays a role in integrating core and accessory genes for symbiotic adaptation. The core and accessory genes exhibited different expression patterns and connectivity under different conditions, with core genes showing a higher level of gene connectivity. Genes on the chromid were found to contribute to host adaptation, while genes on the symbiosis plasmid were more highly expressed in nodules. The study suggests that the chromid plays a key role in integrating accessory genes and optimizing symbiotic functions, while the symbiosis plasmid primarily carries genes required for nitrogen fixation. The findings provide new insights into the organization and regulation of core and accessory genes in facultative microsymbionts and their adaptations to different environments.
This paper discusses a study that uncovers a new similarity between integrating conjugative plasmids and integrating conjugative elements (ICEs) like the SXT/R39 family of ICEs. The study finds that SXT/R39 ICEs, like conjugative plasmids, have a plasmid-like replication system that allows them to replicate when they are excised from the host chromosome. This replication is mediated by an integrase called TraI. This replication allows ICEs to accumulate extra copies of themselves when they are excised, which can then displace the site-specific recombination reaction from excision towards integration. The study also shows that ICEs have a plasmid-like partitioning system called srpMRC, which helps stabilize them. This partitioning system is found in all SXT/R39 ICEs and is distinct from the plasmid-like partitioning system found in conjugative plasmids. The study suggests that ICEs may be more like plasmids than previously thought, with transient replication and active partitioning as a common feature. This finding blurs the distinction between ICEs and plasmids, as both ICEs and plasmids can transiently replicate. The study highlights the complex biology of ICEs and how they have evolved different strategies to maintain themselves in the population.
The paper describes a study that used isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to investigate how the HIV protein Gag binds to RNA during the assembly of the virus. The study found that the interaction between Gag and RNA is energetically favorable, meaning that the binding releases energy. The Gag protein binds more strongly to A-containing RNA sequences than to GU-containing RNA sequences. The study also found that the p6 domain within Gag plays a role in the binding preference for A-containing RNA. This suggests that p6 may have a new function in the assembly process that was not previously known. The results provide insight into how the HIV virus assembles and provide a framework for studying the interactions between Gag and RNA during the process.
The paper discusses how mice with genetic deficiencies in the genes encoding interleukin-10 (IL-10) and nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2) exhibit different immune responses to Mycobacterium leprae infection. Mice with only an IL-10 deficiency have a more robust immune response and show signs of neuropathy, while mice with both IL-10 and NOS2 deficiencies have an exacerbated inflammatory response. This suggests that IL-10 plays a role in controlling the immune response and preventing neuropathy, while NOS2 is involved in restricting bacterial growth. The study shows that mice with IL-10 deficiency have more T cells infiltrating the granuloma and nerves, while mice with both IL-10 and NOS2 deficiencies have more T cells infiltrating the granuloma and nerves. The findings provide an interesting model for investigating immunopathogenesis and potentially identifying M. leprae-specific antigens that could be used for diagnostics to improve detection, monitoring, and treatment of leprosy patients.
The paper discusses how the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) uses immune evasion mechanisms to evade recognition by CD8+ T cells during its lytic cycle replication. The authors deleted the BNLF2a gene, which encodes an immune evasion protein that inhibits antigen presentation to CD8+ T cells, from an EBV recombinant BAC virus. They found that CD8+ T cells could recognize EBV-infected cells that lacked the BNLF2a gene more efficiently, especially those expressing early proteins. This suggests that BNLF2a inhibits antigen presentation from early and early proteins. However, CD8+ T cells were not able to recognize cells expressing the late protein BALF4, which was expressed later in the lytic cycle. The authors propose that BNLF2a likely functions in concert with other immune evasion genes to protect EBV-infected cells during the early phases of replication, while other mechanisms may be involved in blocking antigen presentation during the later stages. The results suggest that immune evasion genes may play a stage-specific role in EBV replication and amplifying its reservoir in hosts.
This paper discusses how bacterial signaling systems, like the Rap-Phr quorum-sensing system, can rapidly expand and diversify through a combination of horizontal gene transfer and gene duplication. The authors analyzed the genomes of 413 bacterial species and found that while horizontal transfer occurs frequently to acquire new signaling systems, gene duplication within a locus is also important for diversifying specificity. They identified that duplication of the autoinducer gene can serve as a transient promiscuous intermediate between two states of specificity. This allows the original promiscuous form to interact with both variants of its partner, while the duplicated gene can interact with either partner. They also found that the duplicated form is transient and may lose its ability to interact with the original partner. This allows the system to diversify and maintain orthogonality between different signaling systems encoded on the same genome. The authors suggest that the ability of signaling systems to rapidly diversify through duplication and transfer may be an important mechanism for bacteria to adapt to changing environments.
The paper investigated the genetic basis of hyperaccumulation and hypertolerance of Arabidopsis halleri, a plant that can tolerate high levels of heavy metals in its soil. They found that gene copy number expansion and cis-regulatory mutations were responsible for the increased expression of the HMA4 gene, which is involved in metal transport. However, they also found that the genetic variation in the HMA4 genes was not uniform across the genome. Instead, there were complex patterns of gene conversion between different copies of the gene, which resulted in a network-like genealogy. This suggests that gene copy number expansion and gene conversion work together to enhance the evolutionary rate of the genes, rather than just gene copy number expansion alone. The study shows that gene copy number variation is an important factor in plant adaptation and may be a valuable target for breeding strategies. The findings highlight the importance of analyzing the complex patterns of nucleotide sequence polymorphism in genes associated with environmental adaptations, rather than just focusing on single genes.
The paper describes the study of the unique motility of African trypanosomes, a parasitic protozoan that causes sleeping sickness in animals. The authors used high-speed microscopy and computer simulations to investigate how the trypanosomes move and how their motility is influenced by their environment. They found that the trypanosomes move in a plane-rotational motion, where the flagellum generates a propulsive force that pushes the cell forward, while the cell body rotates to counteract the force. The flagellum also generates a wave that folds back on itself to help the cell move backward. The authors showed that the trypanosomes' motility is influenced by the viscosity of their environment, and they can move faster in blood than in cell culture. They found that the trypanosomes' motion is a genetically fixed adaptation to the crowded environment of the bloodstream. They conclude that the trypanosomes' motility is a key factor in their survival and virulence in the host. The study provides new insights into how the microenvironment influences cell motility and could be used to develop new drugs against African trypanosomiasis.
The paper proposes a theory for how the hippocampus, a part of the brain involved in memory recall, can efficiently recall memories from metaplastic synapses, which have limited dynamic ranges. Metaplastic synapses have the advantage of retaining information for a power-law amount of time compared to simple two-state synapses, but it is unclear how they can be efficiently recalled. The paper shows that by developing network dynamics that are optimized for autoassociative memory recall, rather than simple additive learning, metaplastic synapses can be recalled efficiently. The optimal network dynamics involve several key motifs that are not found in traditional autoassociative memory models. These include balanced excitation and inhibition, periodic modulation of external and recurrent inputs, and oscillations. The network dynamics can be approximated by more biologically plausible models, but the authors propose that the key mechanisms underlying the optimal dynamics are the dynamic balance of excitation and inhibition and the periodic modulation of inputs. The authors show that the network dynamics can improve recall performance compared to traditional models, and that the trade-offs between recall performance and oscillation strength can be understood in terms of the biological mechanisms. The results provide insights into the computational role of different aspects of the hippocampal circuitry.
This paper describes a computational approach to identify genes that are directly regulated by c-Myc, a transcription factor that plays a key role in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation. The authors used a Bayesian network model that integrates genomic sequence data, ChIP-seq data, gene expression data, and functional annotations to predict c-Myc target genes. They found that their approach identified 460 genes that were directly regulated by c-Myc, 25 of which were novel. The predictions were validated by comparing with experimental datasets and showed good agreement. The approach highlights the importance of epigenetic factors like DNA methylation in modulating c-Myc binding and target gene regulation. The authors also found that c-Myc targets exhibit tissue-specific responses and exhibit different co-expression patterns with c-Myc expression across different tissues. While the predictions likely underestimate the true number of direct c-Myc targets, the approach provides valuable insights into the genomic binding sites and functional genes that are regulated by c-Myc. The study demonstrates the utility of integrating multiple types of data to improve the accuracy of target gene predictions and identifying the tissue-specific responses of c-Myc.
The paper proposes a generic, local-circuit cortical model that can encode time in the hundreds of milliseconds range, which is sufficient for perceptual decision tasks. The model has two networks: a timing network that estimates time by climbing activity and a decision network that makes decisions based on the timing network's estimates. The timing network's activity controls the decision network's speed-accuracy trade-off by imposing different temporal constraints. The timing network's estimates conform to Weber's law, which is a mathematical property that shows the standard deviation of interval estimates scales with the mean. The model demonstrates that the timing network can learn new interval estimates through a simple learning rule and that the standard deviation of the estimates is consistent with experimental measurements. The decision network's activity is controlled by the timing network's estimates, leading to a speed-accuracy trade-off. The paper argues that the encoding of time in the hundreds of milliseconds range is a generic property of local cortical circuits and supports a distributed, generic framework for spatiotemporal integration. The decision network's activity and the speed-accuracy trade-off are consistent with experimental data from perceptual tasks, suggesting that estimating time constraints can be an important source of variability in decision making.
The paper discusses an experiment to control rodents in rural Guinea to reduce the transmission of Lassa fever, a viral hemorragic fever caused by the Lassa virus. The researchers found that chemical rodent control, using anticoagulant baits, was effective in reducing rodent populations, but only for a short time. Rodents returned within 3 months of the intervention ending, indicating that once-yearly treatment is not sufficient. The paper suggests that more sustainable rodent control measures, including trapping and poisoning, environmental hygiene, house repairs, and rodent-proof storage, should be implemented in collaboration with local communities to control rodents outside the home and in nearby fields and gardens. This holistic approach, called "one-health" approach, could be developed to more effectively reduce Lassa fever transmission. The researchers also found that people preferred using anticoagulants rather than poison due to safety concerns.
The paper describes how Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the bacteria that causes tuberculosis, can persist in adipose tissue, which is a fatty tissue in the body. The researchers found that Mtb can enter adipose tissue and remain dormant there, even after the initial infection has been cleared from the lung and spleen. They identified Mtb in adipocytes (fat cells) and found that adipose tissue provides a potential sanctuary for Mtb. They showed that Mtb infection leads to changes in adipose tissue, including the infiltration of immune cells like T cells and macrophages, and the upregulation of genes related to stress response. They also showed that Mtb-specific immune cells like CD8+ T cells and IFN-γ-producing NK cells can be isolated from adipose tissue, indicating that adipose tissue serves as a reservoir for persistent Mtb. These findings suggest that understanding the role of adipose tissue in Mtb infection may provide the basis for rational interventions to treat comorbidities like type 2 diabetes and tuberculosis.
The paper describes a new approach for modeling and predicting the dynamics of the complex microbial communities that live in the human gut, called the intestinal microbiota. The method uses a mathematical model called the Lotka-Volterra equations to infer growth rates, interactions and susceptibilities of the microbes based on time-resolved metagenomic data. The model can predict how the community changes over time in response to perturbations like antibiotics and pathogens. The researchers applied their method to a mouse study that showed that antibiotics reduce the diversity of the microbiota and make it more susceptible to colonization by a certain pathogen. They found that the microbiota does not fully recover its original composition after antibiotic treatment and stays in a perturbation-dependent equilibrium. This suggests that the microbiota has resilience and multistability. They propose a mechanism for how certain microbes protect against colonization and their findings could inform strategies for preventing colonization. The method has potential to improve our understanding of how the microbiota resists colonization and may help develop probiotics to prevent infections.
The paper discusses the relationship between bacterial capsules and genetic exchange. The authors found that bacteria that encode capsules have a higher rate of genetic exchange, measured through homologous recombination and horizontal gene transfer, compared to bacteria that lack capsules. They propose that the presence of capsules may directly or indirectly increase the rate of genetic exchange, by providing a physical barrier to DNA acquisition. However, they also acknowledge that other factors like stressful environments and the need for genetic adaptation may contribute to the observed association. The study suggests that bacteria with capsules have an advantage in terms of genetic diversification, as they are more likely to encode antibiotic resistance genes and are more likely to have mobile genetic elements like prophages and integrons. Overall, the authors propose that the association between capsules and genetic exchange is likely due to a combination of direct and indirect effects, with the presence of capsules providing a physical barrier that may hinder genetic exchange but also allowing for increased genetic exchange under stressful conditions.
The paper proposes a mathematical model to study how mosquitoes find hosts when they are distributed unevenly across a larger space. The model simulates mosquitoes flying in search of hosts in a two-dimensional domain, with the hosts emitting an odor that is carried by the wind and diffuses over the air. The mosquues' flight direction and speed are influenced by the wind and odor plume. The model shows that mosquitoes are more likely to find hosts if they fly in a crosswind direction, rather than upwind or downwind, especially when the odor plume is meandering. This is because mosquues near the plume are more likely to intercept it. The model shows that the size of the area where the hosts are distributed affects the number of mosquito-host contacts, with larger areas resulting in fewer mosquitoes finding hosts. The model also proposes a mathematical formula to estimate the probability that a mosquito will find a host based on the size of the host area relative to the simulation domain, which can be used to predict transmission dynamics. The model could be expanded to include factors like mosquito breeding sites, host movement, multiple odor cues, and the spread of disease. The paper argues that understanding how mosquitoes find hosts in an uneven distribution can help inform strategies to control mosquito populations.
The paper describes a study on the process of combining chromosomes to increase genetic diversity and segregate them efficiently during sexual reproduction in the absence of recombination in diploid cells. The researchers found that when chromosomes fail to homologously align during meiosis, non-homologous centromeres still form stable pairs through the synaptonemal complex, which is composed of Zip1 protein. Two dynamic events occur before homolog pairing: meiotic bouquet formation and non-homology-dependent centromere coupling. The meiotic bouquet is formed by clustering telomeres when they become embedded in a small section of the nuclear envelope. Centromere coupling helps chromosomes find their homologs by preferentially pairing with chromosomes of similar size. The researchers used a modified 3C-qPCR protocol to quantify all possible non-homologous interactions between centromeres in yeast diploid and haploid cells. They found that non-homologous centromere interactions preferentially pair with chromosomes of similar sizes, especially those of similar length. This preference was observed in coupling-proficient cells, but not in cells lacking the meiotic bouquet. The results suggest that the meiotic bouquet serves as a chromosome sorter, helping chromosomes find their homologs based on size. Chromosome size may influence the formation of non-homologous coupling interactions. However, the exact mechanism remains unknown.
The paper discusses how the diffusion of a drug molecule inside a cell can be affected by non-specific interactions with other molecules inside the cell. The authors used a cell culture model to study the diffusion of Hoechst 3332 dye, a DNA-binding dye, and found that the diffusion was much slower than expected based on simple diffusion theory. They showed that the slow diffusion was due to high DNA concentrations, non-specific interactions with other molecules inside the cell, and the presence of a limiting membrane. The diffusion was found to be anomalous, meaning that the molecules move in a non-uniform way. The authors also observed that the diffusion dynamics were cell cycle-dependent, meaning that cells in different phases of the cell cycle had different diffusion rates. They used this model to argue that cells that incorporate the drug rapidly could act as a "sink" and reduce the availability of the drug to slower incorporating cells, potentially leading to drug resistance. This phenomenon could occur on a larger scale in solid tumors, where cells in the outer layers act as a "shield" to trap the drug and facilitate drug resistance of inner cells.
The paper describes a study that aimed to determine the prevalence of podoconiosis, a neglected tropical disease that affects barefoot subsistence farmers in areas with irritant clay soil, in Cameroon. The study found that podoconis is widespread in Cameroon, present in 9 out of 10 regions, with the highest prevalence in the Northwest and North regions. The study surveyed 10,178 people and found 52 cases of podoconis, with a prevalence of 0.5%. The majority of cases were among males aged 25-64 years and started swelling in their 30s. The study used clinical, parasitological and serological tests to rule out other potential causes of lymphedema before diagnosing podoconis. The findings demonstrate the need for podoconis prevention and morbidity management interventions, especially in areas with high prevalence clusters. The study also highlights the importance of including questions about podoconis in routine screening at primary healthcare level. The study provides a baseline for future monitoring of podoconis prevalence and can inform the design of a national podoconis control program.
This paper investigated the role of transposable elements (TEs) in the adaptation of the fruit fly species Drosophila melanogaster that expanded out of Africa. The authors searched for recent adaptive TEs in the genome by focusing on TEs that are rare in Africa and frequent in North America. They identified 13 TEs that were likely adaptive based on population frequency and sequencing data showing signatures of positive selection around these TEs. They sequenced flanking regions around 4 of the identified adaptive TEs and found that the TEs were linked to partial selective sweeps, indicating they were likely the causative mutations rather than just linked to adaptive mutations. They found that most of the adaptive TEs are located in introns or intergenic regions, suggesting they affect gene regulation. They also analyzed the expression of genes next to the adaptive TEs and found that the expression of the alleles containing the TEs was significantly different from the alleles lacking the TEs, supporting their adaptive role. They conclude that TEs are likely a significant source of adaptive mutations in the Drosophila genome and that many adaptive mutations are likely to be ephemeral.
The paper describes the identification and characterization of a genomic region, called the Guadeloupe Resistance Complex (GRC), in the snail species Biomphalaria glabrata that influences the snails' ability to resist Schistosoma mansoni infection. The GRC contains 15 coding genes, including seven TM1 genes that encode transmembrane proteins. These TM1 genes show high nonsynonymous substitutions and are the most divergent, suggesting they may be responsible for the resistance. The authors propose that these TM1 proteins recognize pathogen-associated molecules, leading to a physiological response. The GRC shows patterns of genetic variation consistent with balancing selection, including high linkage disequilibrium and high nonsynonymous diversity, indicating that the alleles have been maintained in balance for an unusually long time. The GRC is a promising target for controlling schistosomiasis, and genetic manipulation of the snails could potentially be used to drive resistance genes or transfect the GRC genes into the snails. The study provides evidence that the GRC is an effective mechanism for resistance and could be used to develop novel approaches to control schistosomiasis.
The paper discusses the impact of vector control and ivermectin distribution on on controlling onchocercias in Cote d'Ivoire. The onchocercias control program in Cote d'Ivoire was initially focused on aerial application of insecticides to river breeding sites, but this was difficult to implement in densely forested areas. In 1987, the recommended strategy for controlling onchocercias in Africa was annual or semi-annual mass treatment with ivermectin, which kills the microfilarial progeny that cause skin disease and blindness. From 2002, vector control had a positive impact on on controlling onchocercias in many areas. More than 1 billion cases of blindness were prevented through ivermectin treatments. However, the program was disrupted by civil war and instability in Cote d'Ivoire, which made it difficult to implement vector control and ivermectin distribution in some areas. Despite these challenges, ivermectin distribution has been shown to significantly reduce onchocercias prevalence in Cote d'Ivoire, with prevalence dropping from 43% to less than 1% in many districts after 10 years of treatment. The country is now working towards elimination of onchocercias through mass drug administration of ivermectin and albendazole, which is being implemented in all districts co-endemic for both onchocercias and LF. However, achieving high coverage is important to interrupt onchcerias transmission and the country still faces challenges such as reaching hard-to-reach areas, low adherence to treatment, and lack of international support. The paper highlights the importance of maintaining and expanding these efforts to achieve elimination of onchocercias in Cote d'Ivoire.
This paper identified an enzyme called Argininosuccinate Synthase (ASS) in the parasite Leishmania donovani that plays a role in the parasite's virulence. The enzyme catalyzes the conversion of citrulline to argininosuccinate, a key step in the urea cycle. The authors showed that the ASS enzyme has a role in the parasite's growth in the mammalian host, as the parasites that express the enzyme have a reduced virulence and are less able to infect mice. They identified that the enzyme is localized in the cytosol and a minor portion in membrane-bound structures. The enzyme's specificity was demonstrated through experiments showing that an inactive mutant form of the enzyme had reduced activity, and that inhibitors of the enzyme blocked its activity. The enzyme's specificity was also shown to be important for the parasite's virulence. The authors propose that targeting the enzyme through drugs or vaccines could be a potential approach to treat leishmaniasis.
The paper proposes a model that attempts to learn and recognize speech by mimicking how birds recognize song. The model consists of two levels of nonlinear dynamical systems. The first level encodes the spectral information of speech, while the second level encodes the temporal information. The model uses Bayesian inference to learn and recognize speech. The key difference between the model and other models is that it uses a hierarchical structure of nonlinear dynamical systems, which allows it to perform both learning and recognition tasks in an online fashion. The model achieves high speech recognition performance even under adverse conditions, which suggests that it could be used to optimize automatic speech recognition systems. The model's neurobiological plausibility provides insights into how the human auditory system processes speech. The model's ability to estimate the precision of internal states also provides a new tool for analyzing brain activity during speech perception and learning.
The paper discusses a study on acute Paracocidomycosis (PCM), a severe systemic mycosis that affects young, immunocompromised patients in endemic in Brazil. The study aimed to analyze epidemiological, clinical, therapeutic and prognostic data in patients with acute PCM at a reference center in Rio de Janeiro. The study found that 29 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria, mostly from rural areas. The majority of patients had lymph node, liver and spleen involvement, and most had low adrenal reserve. The patients were treated with sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim and itrazaole but some required hospitalization and intravenous amphotericin B. The study identified Paracocidiosis brasiliensis genetic sequences from 4 patients, suggesting that the immune response plays a role in the disease's severity. The authors suggest that early diagnosis and treatment is important to prevent complications and death. They encourage more studies on acute PCM to improve understanding and assistance for this neglected disease.
The paper describes a new method called TeXP to accurately quantify the amount of autonomous transcription of repetitive elements in RNA sequencing data. The authors found that most reads mapping to repetitive elements like LINE-1 come from pervasive transcription, which is transcription of random parts of the genome. To address this, they developed TeXP, a method that uses the distribution of reads mapping to different LINE-1 subfamilies to estimate the number of reads coming from autonomous transcription. TeXP uses mappability fingerprints to distinguish reads that map to full-length LINE-1 transcripts from reads that map to shortened or fragmented LINE-1 transcripts. The method was tested on LINE-1 subfamilies and showed that it could accurately estimate the level of autonomous transcription even when the signal-to-noise ratio is low. TeXP was also shown to be able to detect low levels of autonomous transcription in some tissues, like brain and thyroid. The authors argue that pervasive transcription is a confounding factor in estimating the activity of repetitive elements and that their method could be used to quantify autonomous transcription of other repetitive elements beyond LINE-1.
The paper describes a study that identified a genetic mutation in the gene MYT1L as a possible cause of intellectual disability and obesity. The researchers analyzed DNA from 9 individuals with de novo mutations in the gene and found that 4 of them had intellectual disability and obesity. They found that the mutations were associated with changes in the expression of genes involved in regulating appetite and energy metabolism, such as OXT. They also found that the mutations led to a loss of function in the gene and resulted in altered expression of genes involved in brain development and cognition. They proposed that the mutations may cause hyperphagia and obesity by disrupting the development of hypothalamic structures involved in regulating appetite and energy metabolism. They suggest that MYT1L mutations may be a new genetic cause of obesity and that targeting OXT could be a potential therapeutic strategy.
The paper proposes a new statistical method called Quadratic Regularized Canonical Correlation Analysis (QRCCA) for analyzing pleiotropic associations between genetic variants and multiple phenotypes. The method combines three steps: factorizing the genotype data using principal component analysis (PCA), compressing the data using matrix factorization, and applying Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA). The authors show that the proposed QRCCA method outperforms other existing methods in power and flexibility when analyzing rare and common genetic variants separately, and across different types of phenotypes. The results demonstrate the ability to identify pleiotropic genes that affect multiple traits. The authors also discuss limitations of the current methods and propose future research directions to address issues of causal inference and mechanistic understanding of complex traits.
The paper proposes a model to explain how the circadian rhythm of the KaiC protein in cyanobacteria is generated. The authors propose a multi-layer reaction network that mimics the phosphorylation of KaiC. They show that one KaiC hexamer can be viewed as an independent oscillator, but a population of KaiC hexamers forms a more robust and complex oscillatory system. The KaiC phosphorylation exhibits a dynamic diversity of waveforms and phases, which suggests that a "kaleidoscopic" mechanism with stochastic fluctuations may be used to explain the global regulation of genome-wide gene expression. They propose that different KaiC phosphoforms can be combined in different proportions to produce complex phosphorylation signals, with some acting as primary and secondary oscillators. The authors also show that the phase of KaiC phosphorylation is mainly determined by the distribution of phosphorylation sites and that S431 plays a key role in synchronizing the phase of different KaiC hexamers. They propose that the KaiC oscillator may control global circadian transcription through mechanisms such as topological changes in chromosome compaction and interactions with other proteins. The model provides a framework for understanding the dynamics of KaiC phosphorylation in vitro and in vivo, and the predictions made could be tested experimentally.
The paper discusses how the genetic diversity of Francisella novicida within ticks and mice can impact the transmission of the bacteria between the two hosts. The authors found that while mice can sustain a greater number of genotypes, ticks are able to maintain a smaller number of genotypes, particularly when multiple genotypes are present. They propose that this is due to the fact that ticks have limited resources, such as nutrients and receptors, that are required for colonization, which leads to competition among genotypes. This competition causes some genotypes to be eliminated or suppressed. They also found that the initial genetic diversity of the bacteria, as well as the vector-host ratio and host abundance, affects the retention of genetic diversity within the tick population. The study suggests that targeting genotypes within the tick could be an effective strategy to disrupt transmission.
The paper investigated the genetic and molecular differences between non-obese and obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) using DNA methylation and gene expression analysis of adipose tissue. They found that non-obese women with PCOS had higher expression of a gene called LHCGR, which is involved in androgen production in the ovary, while obese women with PCOS had lower expression of a gene called INSR that regulates insulin sensitivity. These differences in gene expression may contribute to the different mechanisms underlying hyperandrogenemia in non-obese versus obese women with PCOS. The study suggests that the gene expression profiles may be different between obese and non-obese PCOS subjects, with hormonal disturbances playing a more important role in non-obese subjects and metabolic disturbances playing a larger role in obese subjects. The findings suggest that different subclassification based on pathophysiology may lead to tailored treatment. The study provides new insight into the genetic loci associated with PCOS and how they contribute to the disorder.
The paper investigates current pain management practices for Buruli ulcer patients in Ghana and Benin. Medical records and interviews were used to collect data on the types of pain medication prescribed and the reasons for prescribing it. Healthcare providers perceived that patients often exaggerated their pain and had unrealistic expectations about pain relief. They mainly prescribed mild pain medication, and focused on severe pain. The study found that there was a discrepancy between healthcare providers' and patients' expectations about acceptable pain levels without medication. Healthcare providers also had limited knowledge about assessing and treating mild pain. The study suggests that a pain management guideline could help address these issues by setting goals for pain control, documenting pain and monitoring pain during treatment.
The paper describes the identification of a new protein called FPC4 that is involved in the segregation of the flagellum in the parasite Trypanosoma brucei. FPC4 is a cytoskeletal protein that localizes to the flagellar pocket and the hook complex, and is required for proper flagellum formation and function. The authors found that FPC4 interacts with the protein BILBO1 through its N-terminal domain, which is similar to a ubiquitin-like fold. Overexpression of FPC4 leads to the formation of a fibre between the old and new flagellum, which may stabilize the MtQ microtubules. FPC4 also interacts with the MORN1 protein, which is part of the hook complex, and co-localizes with BILBO1 on the flagellum. The authors propose that FPC4 may connect the flagellar pocket, hook complex and MtQ microtubules, and its microtubule-binding property may help stabilize the MtQ. The study identifies FPC4 as a multi-partner protein that links the flagellar pocket, hook complex and MtQ, highlighting the importance of the flagellum in the cell cycle and cytoskeleton biogenesis.
The paper discusses the evolution of postzygotic isolation between two species, Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans, which diverged around 3000 years ago. The authors generated introgressions of D. melanogaster DNA into D. simulans by backcrossing D. melanogaster females with D. simulans males. They found that introgressions on the X chromosome cause more hybrid male sterility than introgressions on the autosomes, supporting the idea that the X chromosome has a higher density of genes that cause hybrid sterility. They tested two explanations for this phenomenon: sex-ratio distortion, which causes hybrid sterility in some cases, and dosage compensation, which is disrupted in hybrids. They found no evidence of sex-ratio distortion in their fertile introgressions. They also found that X-linked introgressions were not larger than autosomal introgressions in size, arguing against the faster-X theory. They conclude that the higher density of hybrid male sterility on the X chromosome is likely due to a higher density of genes that cause hybrid sterility on the X chromosome, possibly due to dosage compensation or X inactivation disruption.
This paper describes a study on the thioredoxin enzyme Trx, which catalyzes the reduction of arsenate to arsenite. The authors used molecular dynamics simulations, pKa calculations, and biochemical experiments to investigate the mechanism of Trx-Ars complex dissociation. They found that Trx-Ars complex dissociates through the nucleophilic attack of Cys3Trx on Cys29Trx of the mixed Cys29Trx-Cys8ArsC disulfide. Cys3Trx is activated as a nucleophile by the introduction of hydrogen bonds with the protein backbone, specifically the α1-helix and Cys29Trx-Cys3TrxN hydrogen bond. The pKa of Cys3Trx is lower than the N-terminal thiolate in the Trx active site, allowing it to attack the exposed Cys8ArsC-Cys8ArsC disulfide in the reduced Trx. The local conformational change where Cys3Trx approaches the sulfur of Cys29Trx brings the two sulfur atoms in contact and stabilizes Cys3Trx as a nucleophile. This conformation, termed the "activated complex", is not observed in the experimental structure of the Trx-Ars complex. The authors conclude that the hydrogen bonds stabilize Cys3Trx as a nucleophile, allowing it to dissociate the Trx-Ars complex. The study provides a consistent model of the mechanism and rules out some previous hypotheses, demonstrating the power of combining computational methods and experiments to study thiol/disulfide exchange reactions.
The study aimed to investigate the role of a transcription factor called Atf2 in melanocyte development and melanoma development. They found that loss of an active form of Atf2 in melanocytes inhibits melanoma development in a mouse model. They also found that Atf2 negatively regulates the expression of a transcription factor called MITF, which is important in melanocyte development and melanoma progression. They showed that the negative regulation of MITF by Atf2 is mediated by a protein called JunB. They found that high levels of MITF expression in melanocytes and melanomas are associated with poor prognosis. They propose that Atf2 plays an important role in fine-tuning the expression of MITF and that a balance of MITF expression is required for melanocyte development. Their results provide a genetic evidence for a model in which Atf2 regulates MITF expression and inhibits melanocyte growth, which in turn promotes melanoma development.
The paper discusses how stem cells in the superficial zone of cartilage in the joints are involved in the development of osteoarthritis. The researchers found that stem cells in this zone, called mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), undergo premature aging and senescence, which can contribute to the development of osteoarthritis. They identified a mechanism by which a protein called YAP, a key regulator of cellular aging, can prevent this premature aging by activating a transcription factor called FOXD1. The researchers showed that YAP is required for preventing premature senescence in MSCs, and that YAP transcriptionally activates FOXD1 expression. They also showed that lentiviral gene therapy expressing YAP or FOXD1 can alleviate cellular senescence in mice models of osteoarthritis, reducing inflammation and joint damage. This suggests that targeting senescent cells in the joint may be a potential therapeutic strategy for osteoarthritis.
The paper describes how the secretor status of rotavirus, which is determined by the presence or absence of a fucosyl group on its surface, affects its ability to infect humans. The fucosyl group is recognized by the host cells as a receptor, and the secretor status influences the strength of the interaction between the virus and the receptor. The virus has a specific binding site for this receptor, called the H1 antigen, which is located in a pocket in the surface protein VP8. The secretor virus has a weaker interaction with this antigen compared to the non-secretor virus, which has a fucosyl group on the precursor of the antigen. This difference in affinity for the H1 antigen between secretor and non-secretor viruses is seen in both ELISA and SPR assays. The study found that subtle changes in the binding site in different rotavirus lineages, like the position of a single amino acid, can influence the affinity for the H1 antigen. The results suggest that the secretor status may influence the prevalence of different rotavirus lineages in the population and the viruses' infectivity. The study also shows that a disaccharide called LNB, which binds to the H1 precursor antigen, can inhibit rotavirus infection, providing a potential new anti-adhesin approach.
The paper investigates how the sensory neurons in the antennae of male moths are adapted to the pheromone plumes they detect. The authors use a mathematical model of the odorant reception system to predict the characteristics of the optimal pheromone stimulus that the neurons are best at encoding. They find that the optimal stimulus has a peak/mean ratio that is higher than measured in experiments, indicating that the low concentration pulses are more frequent. This is because the neurons are adapted to encode information at a higher rate for short pulses. The authors suggest that the adaptation occurs at the level of the receptor and perception system, rather than higher level mechanisms like amplification and convergence, although the global adaptation is likely also important. The results suggest that the antennae neurons are adapted to the pheromone plumes, but the full extent of the adaptation remains to be established. The authors provide evidence that the adaptation is not just a simple optimization problem, but involves complex trade-offs between the range of response values and the response speed.
The study found that the community members in the informal settlement in Kisumu city, Kenya had low awareness and knowledge of schistosomiasis. They believed that the disease was not serious and only caused stomach problems, and did not pose a significant threat to their lives. They also had negative attitudes towards schistosomias treatment and control interventions, and believed that the drug was too expensive. As a result, many did not seek medical care. They believed that avoiding contact with contaminated water was the best prevention method. However, the study found that the community's poor sanitation and hygiene practices and environmental factors like overcrowding and lack of knowledge led to the spread of schistosomiasis. The study suggests that community education and awareness campaigns are necessary to raise awareness and improve knowledge and practices around schistosomiasis control. Providing health facilities with diagnostic kits and drugs in endemic areas is also important.
The paper discusses how the mTORC1 signaling pathway is exploited by the influenza virus to promote viral replication. The authors find that the virus activates the mTORC1 pathway through phosphorylation of AKT at T308, which in turn activates mTORC1. mTORC2 is not required for mTORC1 activation. The mTORC1 pathway activates translation of key viral proteins and promotes viral replication. The mTORC1 pathway also regulates apoptosis and autophagy. The authors identify key substrates of mTORC1 during infection, including translation factors and phosphorylation sites that are regulated by the pathway. Overall, the study shows that mTORC1 signaling is a key mechanism used by the virus to support viral replication and survival, and highlights potential therapeutic targets for treating influenza infection.
This paper proposes a new measure called "regulation entropy" to quantify the topological properties of biological regulatory networks. The authors find that biological networks generally have low regulation entropy compared to randomly generated networks, which makes them more robust against external perturbations. They show that networks with low regulation entropy tend to have stable dynamics and are insensitive to parameter variations. This correlation between regulation entropy and robustness holds across different biological networks, including the budding and fission yeast cell cycles, the guard cell signaling network, the T cell receptor signaling network, and the protein-protein interaction network. The results suggest that the low regulation entropy of biological networks is a key factor in their ability to produce reliable dynamics and achieve global attractors, and that the topological structure of the network plays a role in determining the robustness. The study provides new insights into why biological networks can be well modeled using Boolean approximations and how they achieve convergent dynamics.
The paper discusses how the geographical scale at which schistosomiasis prevalence is estimated affects the number of praziquantel treatments needed for preventive chemotherapy in school-aged children. The authors used spatially explicit model-based estimates of schistosomiasis risk at high resolution to assess the impact of different administrative levels of prevalence aggregation on treatment needs. They found that calculating schistosomias risk at a smaller administrative level (e.g. district) resulted in higher estimated treatment needs compared to country-level estimates, as many areas had moderately endemic prevalence of schistosomiasis. The authors argue that stratifying areas based on environmental factors, such as proximity to freshwater bodies and ecozones, would be more appropriate for effective preventive chemotherapy. However, most schistosomias data is currently aggregated at administrative levels, making it difficult for local health managers to implement preventive programs. The authors conclude that the geographical scale of schistosomias risk estimates should consider the expected country-specific prevalence level and the variability in schistosomias distribution within a country to accurately calculate treatment needs. While preventive chemotherapy is the mainstay for schistosomias control, it is unlikely to achieve transmission control on its own and complementary measures will be required.
This paper investigated the prevalence of active trachoma and ocular chlamydia trachomatis infection in children under 10 years old in two regions of The Gambia a decade after a national survey. The study found that the prevalence of active trachoma in children remained relatively unchanged since the previous survey at around 10%, while the prevalence of ocular chlamydia infection was very low, with only 3 of 94 samples from one region testing positive. The authors suggest that this low prevalence of infection may indicate that transmission of chlamydia is now rare in these communities, and that mass treatment of entire regions or districts based on clinical signs of trachoma may be unnecessary. However, treatment decisions based on laboratory tests for infection may be a better approach to target those households with infected individuals. The study also suggests that the discrepancy between clinical signs and infection may indicate that children with clinical signs of trachoma but no infection are unlikely to develop blinding sequelae.
The paper describes the structure of the spike protein of SARS-CoV, a highly pathogenic coronavirus that causes severe respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases. The spike protein has three subunits: S1, S2, and S3. The spike protein is synthesized as a precursor protein and then undergoes cleavage to form the mature, trimeric structure. The authors investigated the structure of the spike protein in different states, including before and after cleavage at the S1/S2 site. They found that the prefusion structure of the spike protein is retained after cleavage, and the conformational changes of the CTD1 subunit do not significantly affect the overall architecture and conformation. However, binding of ACE2 to the spike protein causes a conformational change in the CTD1 subunit that exposes the S2 cleavage site, which is required for cleavage. The authors observed different conformational states of the spike protein bound to ACE2, including one with the CTD1 in the "up" position and one with the CTD1 in the "down" position. They also observed the formation of rosette-shaped particles after cleavage, which is consistent with the known postfusion structure of the MHV spike protein. The results provide insights into the mechanisms of SARS-CoV infection and the role of the spike protein in binding to ACE2.
The paper discusses the role of a protein called Facilitin Chromatin Transcription (FACT) in repairing DNA damage caused by oxidation. FACT is released from transcribed chromatin and relocated to chromatin loci associated with repair proteins and chromatin remodelers involved in DNA repair. FACT boosts the ability of a remodeling complex called RSC to mobilize nucleosomes and slid them, allowing the repair of DNA lesions. FACT does not directly alter the structure of the nucleosome, but instead increases the efficiency of the remodeling complex's ability to alter histone-DNA interactions. The authors suggest that FACT acts in DNA repair by reorganizing the nucleosome substrate to make it more "remodelable" and by increasing the energy efficiency of the ATP-dependent remodeling process. FACT's co-remodeling activity is observed in vitro by increasing the ability of RSC to remove uracil from nucleosomes and slid them. The authors propose that FACT acts in vivo by reorganizing the nucleosome substrate and boosting the efficiency of ATP-dependent remodeling factors like RSC, allowing for more efficient repair of DNA lesions.
This paper investigates the genetic history of the Glossina pallidipes colony used for tset control. The colony was established in 1975 from 36 females. The paper compares genetic diversity between the colony and potential source populations from Kenya and Uganda. The results suggest that the colony originated from the Kenya/Uganda border area and has experienced a severe genetic bottleneck, resulting in a loss of genetic diversity. This is inferred from multiple approaches including ABC modeling, microsatellite analysis and historical information. The genetic bottleneck is likely due to tset control measures in the area in the 1970s. This loss of genetic diversity may impact the effectiveness of tset control using the colony. The findings demonstrate the usefulness of model-based methods like ABC modeling over traditional population genetic approaches for detecting genetic bottlenecks in laboratory colonies. The results imply that the genetic diversity of the colony is lower than field populations and may impact the effectiveness of tset control. The study highlights the importance of considering the demography of source populations when analyzing genetic diversity in laboratory colonies to avoid biased inferences.
This paper proposes using Wikipedia as a source of data to estimate the level of influenza-like illness (ILI) activity in the US. The authors found that by analyzing the number of views of certain Wikipedia articles related to influenza, health and related topics, they could estimate current ILI activity within a reasonable range of error compared to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data. While the CDC data is considered the gold standard, it has some biases due to limited reporting by healthcare providers and increased media attention during high ILI seasons. The authors developed models using Wikipedia article view data and compared them to CDC and Google Flu Trends (GFT) data. The models performed well, estimating ILI peaks within 1 week of the actual peak for 4 of the 6 influenza seasons for which data was available, while GFT overestimated the severity of ILI in one season by 2. The Wikipedia models could provide a reliable estimate of ILI activity up to 2 weeks in advance of traditional reporting, making them a potential supplement to CDC data. However, the authors note that there are some limitations to the approach, such as the data being aggregated and not specific to the US, and the potential for decreased Wikipedia editor activity to negatively impact the accuracy of the models.
The paper discusses the role of two different inflammasomes, NLRP3 and NLRC4, in protecting against oral fungal infections caused by Candida albicans. They found that NLRP3 is more important for controlling systemic infection, while NLRC4 plays a more prominent role in protecting the oral mucosa from fungal infection. NLRP3-deficient mice had higher fungal burden in their tongues and were more susceptible to systemic dissemination, while NLRC4-deficient mice had a higher fungal burden in their tongues and more severe disease. They also found that NLRC4 was required for neutrophil recruitment into the infected tissues and proper trafficking to the site of infection. The NLRC4 inflammasome was found to be active specifically in the mucosal tissues, not the hematopoietic compartment, and was critical for the induction of antimicrobial peptides and cytokines that help protect the oral mucosa. They propose that NLRC4 may recognize a conserved sequence or structural feature of fungal proteins that induces its activation early in in in infection. The findings suggest that early activation of NLRC4 in the oral mucosa may lead to the induction of anti-fungal responses that protect the host from overwhelming mucosal and disseminated infection.
This paper analyzed data from cognitive neuroscience and psychology journals to determine the reproducibility of published studies. The authors extracted effect sizes, degrees of freedom, and statistical significance from 300000+ papers published between 2010 and 2014. They found that the majority of studies had low statistical power, which led to exaggerated reported effect sizes. This resulted in high false positive findings, meaning the actual effect sizes were likely much smaller than what was reported. The authors estimated the false positive rate (FRP) assuming effect sizes were inflated and calculated power based on the actual degrees of freedom and effect sizes. They found that cognitive neuroscience studies had lower power levels than psychology studies, likely due to the complexity of neuroimaging techniques and the tendency to report false positives. They suggest that high FRP is likely in cognitive neuroscience and psychology, even after accounting for bias, due to low power, selective reporting, and errors. They recommend preregistration of study objectives, minimum power calculations, raising statistical significance thresholds, and other measures to improve reproducibility.
The paper describes a study on the regeneration abilities of the colonial ascidian B. leachi. The authors found that this species can regenerate its entire body from small fragments of blood vessels, called ampullae, within 10-14 days. They identified three stages of regeneration and showed that retinoic acid (RA) signaling is involved in this process. They found that RA is expressed throughout the entire body and not just in specific tissues or organs, and that macrophages within the blood vessels are the cellular source of the regenerating buds. They showed that disrupting RA signaling through various methods (DEAB, Citral, RNAi) leads to arrested regeneration and malformation of the buds, while systemic administration of RA results in accelerated regeneration and the development of multiple functional zooids. They suggest that the ability of B. leachi to regenerate its entire body from small fragments may indicate that the systemic inhibition of all buds could be achieved through controlling RA transcriptional cascade. They propose that the Botrylloides whole body regeneration may serve as a model for studying the evolutionary roots of organism regeneration and regeneration mechanisms.
The paper discusses how Schistosoma mansoni eggs, which are the parasitic eggs of the Schistosoma mansoni parasite, can cause hepatitis in mice. The authors found that eggs alone or soluble egg antigen released from the eggs can induce a Th2-type immune response and cause hepatocyte damage. They identified two proteins in the eggs that were found to be hepatotoxic: omega-1 and IPSE/alpha-1. Omega-1 is a ribonuclease that induces a Th2 response in vitro and in vivo. They showed that depleting the eggs of omega-1 or IPSE/alpha-1 significantly reduced hepatotoxicity. This suggests that these two proteins are the main hepatotoxins released by the eggs, leaving room for other hepatotoxins to be identified. The results highlight the paradox that while the granulomatous response in schistosomiasis is detrimental in the long term, it protects against more acute hepatocyte injury caused by egg-derived toxins. Understanding how these hepatotoxins work may help in the development of new treatments for the disease.
The paper describes an experimental approach to study how different regions of a gene's sequence, in addition to the promoter, can affect its expression level. The authors constructed a synthetic library of yeast strains in which different 3' end sequences were integrated downstream of a fluorescent protein reporter gene. They measured the fluorescence of the strains under different galactose conditions to quantify the effect of the 3' end sequences on expression. They found that 3' end sequences span a continuous range of expression levels, and that higher A/T content in the upstream region of the 3' UTR correlated with higher expression. This suggests that the 3' UTR may play an important role in determining mRNA levels. The authors propose that the 3' end sequences affect protein expression by affecting the size of protein bursts, rather than the frequency of protein production. They show that different 3' end sequences have different effects on burst frequency and size, consistent with the idea that 3' end sequences affect mRNA levels but have little effect on noise. Their results demonstrate that 3' end sequences are a promising candidate for designing circuits that can modulate protein expression levels with little effect on noise. The approach provides insights into how different layers of gene expression regulation affect protein expression.
The paper proposes a new method called GP4Rate to identify functional sites in proteins based on their substitution rates. The method uses a Gaussian process to model the spatial correlation of substitution rates across sites in the protein tertiary structure. The Gaussian process defines a prior distribution over site-specific log substitution rates, which captures the spatial correlation of substitution rates in proteins. This allows the method to naturally model the spatial correlation of substitution rates, unlike existing methods that assume substitution rates are independent across sites. The method combines the Gaussian process with a phylogenetic likelihood function to infer site-specific substitution rates from the data. In simulations, GP4Rate was shown to significantly outperform existing methods that assume independence of substitution rates across sites. In real data analyses on the B7-1 protein, GP4Rate predicted a functional patch in the protein structure and 4 sites within the patch were experimentally verified. The method can be useful for identifying functional regions that are not directly related to protein stability. The time complexity of GP4Rate can be reduced in the future using advanced algorithms.
The paper discusses the role of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α) in Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) infection and its effects on primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) cells. The authors found that HIF-1α is present in PEL cells even under normoxic conditions and plays a role in maintaining the growth and survival of the cells. HIF-1α inhibition leads to reduced glycolysis, lipid synthesis, and expression of KSHV genes that promote oncogenicity. HIF-1α inhibition also impairs KSHV lytic replication and growth of PEL cells. The authors suggest that targeting HIF-1α could be an attractive therapeutic strategy for KSHV-associated malignancies, particularly primary effusion lymphomas, since PEL cells are particularly vulnerable to HIF-1α suppression. They demonstrated this by showing that a small molecule inhibitor of HIF-1α selectively impaired the growth and proliferation of PEL cells, while having little effect on non-infected B cells. The results provide evidence that HIF-1α is a potential therapeutic target for KSHV-induced tumors, particularly primary effusion lymphomas.
This paper explores how the bacterium Bacillus subtilis transitions from a non-competent to a competent state during growth. The transition is found to be driven by an increase in the basal firing rate of a promoter element called comK as the bacteria approach stationary phase, which amplifies an inherent increase in the activity of the gene comK. The increase in comK is found to be due to external factors rather than internal noise within individual cells. A protein called Spo0A is found to play a key role in this process, as it amplifies the basal comK expression and modulates the window of opportunity for transitioning to competence. The protein Spo0A increases and is maintained throughout the time of the comK uptick, and its binding sites on the comK promoter are identified. The concentration of Spo0A determines the probability of transition to competence, but intrinsic noise in comK expression is the major factor in determining which cells will transition. The paper suggests that the gradual increase in Spo0A concentration serves as a "clock" to orchestrate the timing of gene expression during growth and that the uptick profile is determined by the programmed increase in Spo0A, rather than cell-to-cell variation in Spo0A expression.
The paper describes a new method for detecting infection with the parasite Taenia serialis in geladas, a primate species, using dried urine samples. The method involves an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that detects the presence of antigens produced by the parasite's larval stage. The researchers found that 18% of geladas tested positive for the antigen, even though only 4.8% had visible cysts, indicating that many infections may be too young or deep inside the host to be detected. This suggests that the antigen presence in urine samples likely reflects active infections rather than just the presence of eggs in the gut. The results suggest that infections are more widespread than previously thought and may not always be visible. The findings provide evidence for the importance of monitoring Taenia infections in wildlife to better understand their impact on host populations and inform control efforts. The method could be useful for monitoring infections in areas where refrigeration is not practical, but the assay is genus-specific and may cross-react with other parasites.
The paper describes a new method called multiplex real-time PCR (MTq-PCR) for typing Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite that causes Chagas disease. This method can detect six distinct genetic types (Differentiated units or DTUs) of the parasite in both cultured stocks and biological samples. The conventional PCR method was shown to be less sensitive for detecting low levels of infection in clinical samples, while the MTq-PCR method was more sensitive and could detect infections at lower concentrations. The MTq-PCR method was also found to be more inclusive for all DTUs and less prone to false positives. The authors conclude that the MTq-PCR method is a valuable tool for surveillance and identification of outbreak sources or follow-up infections in seronegative recipients who receive infected organs from seropositive donors.
The paper discusses the possible relationship between the parasitic infection Toxoplasma gondii and the autoimmune disease Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). The authors conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that examined the association between toxoplasmosis and RA. They found that toxoplasmosis was significantly more common in people with RA compared to controls, with an odds ratio of 3.30. The studies showed that toxoplasmosis was significantly more prevalent in Latin America and Europe compared to other regions. The authors suggest that toxoplasmosis may contribute to the progression of chronic diseases and that treatment with immunosuppressive drugs may increase the susceptibility of patients to infections like toxoplasmosis. The findings suggest that toxoplasmosis may trigger a pathological process in individuals that can lead to RA, although further studies are needed to better understand the relationship. Despite the significant association found, the study had limitations due to small sample sizes, differences in study quality, methods of measuring antibodies, and lack of evaluation of factors like age and gender. The authors recommend that further studies be conducted in other regions and with larger sample sizes to achieve more accurate results.
The paper discusses a study that shows that Wolbachia bacteria, when infected in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, reduces the mosquitoes' ability to transmit dengue fever virus. The bacteria causes the mosquitoes to delay the time it takes for the virus to reach their saliva after feeding on an infected human, and reduces the amount of virus in their saliva. The mosquitoes also produce less saliva as they age. The study found that the reduction in saliva production and delay in virus arrival in the saliva can explain the reduction in the mosquitoes' ability to transmit the virus. The study suggests that Wolbachia may provide an additional means by which it can modulate virus transmission beyond just the infection and dissemination of the virus in the mosquito's body. The findings provide evidence that Wolbachia could be a promising strategy to reduce the transmission of dengue fever, particularly in areas where the virus is prevalent.
The paper describes a new approach to identifying pleiotropic genes using Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA). The authors propose using CCA in combination with a genetic algorithm as an optimization method to select the most important phenotypes associated with each gene. They divide the analysis into four stages: studying the individual association between each gene and a single phenotype, studying the association between one gene and a set of phenotypes, studying the association between multiple genes and a single phenotype, and studying the association between multiple genes and multiple phenotypes. The CCA algorithm is used to find linear combinations of genotype and phenotype variables that maximally correlate with each other. The authors use a genetic algorithm as an optimization method to find the most correlated feature sets, which are then used to identify pleiotropic genes. They apply a Bonferroni correction to correct for multiple testing. They also compare their results to Fisher's combined p-value approach and find that CCA can identify pleiotropic effects that are not detected by the other method. The approach is applied to a large dataset of genetic and phenotypic data from the British Women's Heart and Health Study and identifies new pleiotropic associations.
The paper discusses how the Robo receptor, which is involved in Slit-Robo repulsive guidance, is endocytosed by the cell surface and then internalized into the endosome to activate its signaling. The authors show that loss of endocytosis leads to defects in Slit-Robo repulsion in both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that endocytosis is required for the receptor to function properly. They identify specific motifs in the Robo protein that are important for endocytosis and show that Slit stimulates endocytosis of Robo. The authors propose that endocytosis allows the Robo receptor to activate downstream effectors like Son of Seven, which in turn recruits actin and mediates the repulsive signaling. The results suggest that endocytosis plays a key role in the guidance of growing axons during development by expanding the spatial range of the activated Robo receptor beyond its tips, allowing it to signal to the rest of the growth cone. The authors propose that endocytosis may also serve as a retrograde cue for growth cone behavior, mobilizing Robo from the tips of filopodia to influence growth cone dynamics.
The paper discusses the role of a protein called Arf4 in the transport of a protein called fibrocystin to the cilium, a sensory organelle found in many eukaryotic cells. The authors found that Arf4 interacts with a specific sequence in fibrocystin called the ciliary targeting sequence (CTS) and is required for the efficient transport of fibrocystin to the cilium. However, Arf4 is not necessary for the formation of cilia themselves. Instead, the authors propose that Arf4 plays a broader role in cellular trafficking and may be involved in the transport of other proteins to various cellular compartments beyond the cilium. The authors used genetic mouse models to show that loss of Arf4 function leads to embryonic lethality in mice, likely due to defects in the visceral endoderm tissue, which is the major site of high internalization and trafficking of nutrients in the developing embryo. The visceral endoderm has defects in cell-cell contacts, organization of the brush border, and failure to localize a protein called megalin. The authors conclude that Arf4 likely plays a role in cellular trafficking beyond just the cilium and may be involved in human diseases such as ciliopathies.
The paper examines how recombination affects the rate of adaptation in an evolving population. The authors used a high-throughput fitness assay to estimate the fitness landscape of HIV-1, a subtype of HIV. They found that recombination leads to a substantial increase in the rate of adaptation, with the effect being strongest for moderate recombination rates and intermediate population sizes. They found that both main and epistatic effects of mutations contribute to the acceleration of adaptation, with epistatic interactions enhancing the effect of recombination. They also found that population epistasis during adaptation is mostly negative, which suggests that the accelerating effect of recombination is due to the Fisher-Muller effect. However, the authors note that their study has limitations due to the simplified model used and the inaccuracies in the fitness estimates. They argue that their findings highlight the potential role of recombination in accelerating evolution in retroviruses like HIV, despite debates on the topic.
The paper discusses the role of exon 7 of the non-coding RNA Xist in the process of X-inactivation. Xist is a non-coding RNA that plays a key role in X-inactivation, but the exact mechanisms by which it does so are not well understood. The authors generated Xist mutants with a truncated exon 7 to study its effect on Xist localization and X-linked gene silencing. They found that the mutant Xist lacking exon 7 resulted in unstable localization of Xist RNA on the Xi and impaired X-linked gene silencing. They showed that the interaction between Xist RNA and the RNA-binding protein hnRNP U is essential for stable Xist localization. They found that multiple hnRNP binding sites within exon 7 of Xist RNA are required for stable localization of Xist RNA. They propose that stable Xist localization on the Xi is mediated through the binding of hnRNP U to both exon 1 and exon 7 of Xist RNA. The results suggest that the interaction between hnRNP U and exon 7 of Xist RNA is crucial for stable localization and X-linked gene silencing. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of Xist function and its role in X-inactivation.
The paper discusses the current state of knowledge on leptospirosis, a neglected tropical disease that affects both humans and animals, in Africa. The authors performed a systematic review of studies on leptospirosis in Africa to determine the geographic distribution, prevalence, and diversity of the disease in both humans and animals. They found that leptospirosis is widespread across Africa and affects a wide range of species, including livestock and wild animals. However, there is limited data on the burden of the disease in Africa, with only a few studies providing estimates of incidence. The review identified three predominant species of leptospira bacteria and a diversity of serogroups in both humans and animals. The authors suggest that more research is needed to better understand the relationship between human and animal leptospira infections and how they contribute to transmission of the disease, particularly in livestock species. This integrated "one health" approach could help identify control measures to reduce the impact of leptospirosis on both humans and animals in Africa.
The paper describes a mouse model that exhibits dystonia, a movement disorder characterized by involuntary muscle contractions, caused by a mutation in the ATP1A3 gene. The mutation causes the Na+/K+ pump to fail to function properly. The mice exhibit hypothermia-induced dystonia, which is not typically triggered by environmental stressors like temperature changes. The study shows that the mice have abnormal cerebellar activity during hypothermia, including irregular firing of cerebell neurons, which is likely the cause of the dystonia. The irregular firing is more pronounced in the Purkinje cells, which only express the mutated Na+/K+ pump isoform. The study suggests that dystonia caused by the mutated Na+/K+ pump may be related to impaired function of the cerebellum, and that cerebellar activity may be a useful biomarker for identifying and monitoring the disorder.
This paper describes how researchers used a model of interspecies competition between two bacteria, Streptomyces and Bacillus subtilis, to identify new functions for the bacterial species. They found that when Streptomyces produced a molecule that inhibited the growth of Bacillus subtilis, it caused the Bacillus cells to form wrinkled colonies and degraded them. They identified the molecule as linearmycins, which are antibiotics produced by Streptomyces. They found that specific mutations in a two-component system in Streptomyces, called YfiJ, activate the linearmycins and cause the wrinkled colony morphology and resistance to the inhibitor. They showed that the mutations activate an ABC transporter in Streptomyces, called YfiLM, that is necessary for the resistance to the antibiotic. They propose that this two-component system in Streptomyces activates both resistance to the linearmycins and a general survival response that promotes competitive fitness in bacteria. This approach allowed them to identify new functions for the two-component system that were not previously known.
This paper discusses a rare disease called spinal echinocococcosis, or hydatid disease, which affects the spine and is caused by a parasite called Echinocococcus granulosus. The parasite has two hosts, a definitive host (usually a dog) and an intermediate host (usually a sheep). The definitive host has the parasite attached to the skin and produces eggs, which are then passed in the feces. The intermediate host ingests the eggs and the parasite develops into a fluid-filled cyst called a hydatid cyst. Spinal cysts are found mainly in the liver and lungs, but can affect any part of the body. The central nervous system and spine are particularly vulnerable. The paper reviews 47 cases of spinal hydatidosis from 195 until 2012 and finds that spinal hydatidosis primarily affects the thoracic spine, with the thoracic vertebrae being most frequently involved. The age of patients with intradural cysts is significantly younger than those with extradural cysts. Most cases of spinal hydatidos had a history of surgery for pulmonary hydatidos, suggesting that the parasite may enter the spine through the portal vein from the lungs. The authors suggest that the long latency period and age of onset of spinal hydatidos indicates that the parasite may remain dormant for a long time before symptoms appear.
This paper analyzed the transcriptomes of human, chimpanzee, and rhesus macaque brains using RNA-seq to identify novel transcripts that are not annotated as genes. The researchers found that these novel transcripts, called "highly transcribed regions" or "HTR", are more highly expressed in the human brain than in the other two species. They identified 1,093 such regions in the human brain and 48% of them overlap with known genes, indicating that they may represent extensions or alternative splicing of known genes. The study showed that HTR are conserved across the three species, with the most recent expansion of repeat elements being transcribed at higher levels. The expression levels of HTR are higher than protein-coding genes, indicating that many may represent novel non-coding RNA function. The study found that intergenic regions contain a disproportionate number of HTR, and that the expression of these regions is more highly conserved across the three species than expected by chance. The authors suggest that HTR may play a role in the evolution of the human phenotype. The study highlights the complexity and diversity of the transcriptome in the brain and provides a resource for studying regulatory evolution in primates.
This paper investigates the role of a protein called DYX1C1 in the assembly of cilia in the organism Chlamydomonas. The researchers found that a mutation in the DYX1C1 gene in the organism Chlamydomonas resulted in defects in ciliary dynein assembly, including missing inner dynein arms and outer dynein arms. They found that DYX1C1 is required for the assembly of ciliary dyneins in the cytoplasm before they are transported to the axonemes, and that it plays a major role in the preassembly of inner dynein arms. They propose that DYX1C1 functions as a scaffold for the association of various dynein components and provides stability to ciliary dyneins both in the cytoplasm and axonemes. They also found that DYX1C1 is needed for the assembly of ciliary dyneins in a way that is independent of other preassembly factors. Further research is needed to determine the precise mechanistic role of DYX1C1 in dynein assembly.
This paper investigated the role of the mitochondrial m-AA protease in adult oligodendrocytes, which are glial cells that myelinate neurons. The authors found that while oligodendrocytes can survive with reduced levels of the m-AA protease, complete loss of the m-AA protease triggers rapid cell death. They generated mouse models that expressed different levels of the m-AA protease in oligodendrocytes, and found that oligodendrocytes that lacked the m-AA protease for a long time survived but ultimately showed late-onset myelin abnormalities and axonal degeneration. In contrast, complete loss of the m-AA protease caused rapid cell death. The authors conclude that the threshold of m-AA protease activity allowing survival of neurons and myelinating cells is different, and that different metabolic profiles may underlie the different vulnerability of these cell types. The study provides insights into the mechanisms of oligodendrocyte, SC, and melanoblast survival and may shed light on the pathologies associated with mutations in the m-AA protease.
The paper describes the first structural characterization of a lysin, a cell wall hydrolase enzyme that is involved in the lysis of bacteria. The lysin LysG15 from a staphylocococcus phage was found to contain a calcium-binding site near its active site that is critical for its activity. The paper determined the structures of its individual domains, which showed that calcium ions are required for the activity of the lytic activity of the chap domain and the amidase-2 domain. The SH3b domain, which does not have lytic activity on its own, was found to be necessary for the high processivity of LysG15. The calcium ions coordinate with key residues in the chap domain and binds to a groove on the surface of the protein that is important for catalysis. The study provides insights into the mechanism of lytic activity and how calcium ions modulate the activity of this enzyme.
The paper describes a new mechanism by which the bacterium Staphylocococcus aureus forms biofilms. The authors found that a protein called Bap is secreted from the cell wall and then broken into fragments that self-assemble into amyloid-like fibers that form the biofilm matrix. The pH of the environment inhibits the aggregation of the Bap fragments, which are then unable to form cell-cell aggregates. The amyloid fibers are able to induce cell-cell aggregation, which helps form the biofilm. The pH at which Bap fragments aggregate is close to the iso-electric point, where proteins are most soluble, allowing the fibers to form. The ability to switch between soluble and amyloid states allows Bap to survive fluctuations in pH during the growth cycle. The authors also found that Bap orthologs in other Staphylocococcus species have similar mechanisms for forming biofilms. The mechanism may play an important role in infectious processes, especially in conditions where pH fluctuates, such as during lactation. The ability of Bap to form biofilms through amyloid fibers may be significant for certain Staphylococcus species that colonize human niches with mildly acidic conditions.
The paper describes a new computational framework for predicting functional binding sites in regulatory DNA sequences across multiple species. The authors propose a phylogenetic pair hidden Markov model (PPHMM) approach that allows for modeling evolutionary changes in binding sites and incorporates different sequence evolution models. They show that their approach outperforms existing methods in predicting functional binding sites and aligning genomic sequences across multiple species. The model is able to identify novel binding sites that are not conserved across all species, and can predict binding sites that are interrupted by indels. The authors evaluate their approach using ChIP-seq data and ROC-like curves to show that it outperforms existing methods, particularly when there is no complete orthology assumption. They demonstrate their approach on a set of Drosophila developmental enhancers and find that their approach can identify sites that are not well-conserved across species. They also show that their model can predict binding sites that are conserved across species but have different nucleotide sequences. The approach is flexible and allows for simulating evolutionary changes in binding sites and aligning genomic sequences at both nucleotide and element levels. The authors believe their framework has the potential to improve prediction accuracy and enable further research on regulatory element evolution.
The paper discusses how humans adapt to familiar object dynamics when manipulating everyday objects. The authors found that adaptation to familiar object dynamics occurs rapidly through a single-rate process, unlike adaptation to novel dynamics which occurs more slowly through a dual-rate process. They developed a state-space model that accounts for adaptation to familiar object dynamics. The model showed that adaptation to familiar object dynamics occurs through a single context-specific representation, which is updated based on kinematic errors and influenced by a generalization function. The visual context of the object was found to play a key role in selectively engaging the appropriate representation. The model was able to reproduce previous studies of adaptation to familiar object dynamics, suggesting that familiarity is a key factor in determining the rate of adaptation. The authors conclude that the ability to skillfully manipulate everyday objects likely involves multiple representations that are selectively engaged based on the context of the object and updated through a single-rate adaptation process.
This paper explores how microbial communities can diversify through cross-feeding interactions between different microbial strains. The authors develop a simple mathematical model of two strains, one that consumes a primary resource and the other that consumes a secondary resource produced by the first. They show that cross-feeding can emerge and persist under the right environmental conditions, such as sufficient resource availability and frequency and population density. They also show that cross-feeding interactions can exhibit complex dynamics like bi- and tri-stable states, which are density and frequency dependent. The model highlights the importance of a trade-off between resource utilization rates and yields, rather than a convex trade-off between resource utilization, as previously thought. They argue that cross-feeding is not just a feature of laboratory systems, but is also found in natural microbial communities, tumors and chronic infections. The model predicts that cross-feeding interactions can arise in seasonal environments with temporal heterogeneities and that they can lead to increased metabolic efficiency. The findings provide insights into how cross-feeding emerges and is maintained in microbial communities and have implications for understanding the origin and fate of genetic diversity and the role of cross-feeding in disease.
The paper discusses the results of a study testing different vaccine formulations and schedules against Leishmania donovani infection in macaques. The vaccines were based on the A2 amastigote specific antigen. The results showed that vaccination with the recombinant A2 protein, DNA or adenovirus encoding A2 induced specific antibody responses and some degree of protection against Leishmania infection, with the recombinant A2/alum formulation being most effective. The vaccinated macaques had lower parasite loads and less clinical symptoms compared to the controls. However, the protective immunity was not complete and the vaccines did not completely eliminate infection. The study suggests that a combination of priming with DNA or adenovirus followed by boosting with subunit A2 protein plus rhIL-12 cytokine may be a promising approach for vaccine development. The study highlights the importance of using macaque models for testing vaccine efficacy against Leishmania infection, as human clinical outcomes are highly variable and difficult to predict. The results suggest that a combination of different vaccine components may be needed to achieve good protection.
This paper investigated how a protein called LKB1 regulates lipid metabolism in Drosophila. The researchers found that LKB1 activates a protein called SIK3, which in turn regulates lipolysis in response to changes in energy availability. They showed that LKB1 and SIK3 are necessary for maintaining lipid storage in Drosophila. LKB1 is activated by the hormone AKH, which inhibits SIK3's activity when there is high energy availability. In response to fasting, AKH inhibits LKB1's activity, leading to SIK3's nuclear localization and increased lipolysis. They also found that DILPs, another hormone, can directly regulate SIK3 activity. The researchers showed that LKB1 and SIK3 are required for lipid storage in Drosophila and that LKB1 is necessary for the function of SIK3. This study suggests that the LKB1-SIK3-HDAC4 pathway is an evolutionary conserved mechanism for lipid homeostasis and may be relevant for human obesity and related metabolic diseases.
This paper describes a new method to determine the atomic resolution structure of membrane proteins in different states using information from various biophysical and biochemical experiments. The method uses non-interacting molecular fragments, which are represented in atomic detail and attached to the protein via their overlapping backbone atoms. Each molecular fragment corresponds to a specific residue-residue interaction, such as a metal ion bridge or spin-label. The fragments are restrained during molecular dynamics simulations to satisfy experimental distance constraints, allowing the protein to adjust its conformation to satisfy multiple constraints simultaneously without large changes. The authors test the method by refining the structure of the voltage-sensing domain of a potassium channel using different sets of experimental constraints, generating multiple models that are in good agreement with each other and with previous consensus models. The method can also be used to incorporate other advanced simulation methods and structural constraints, making it a convenient and efficient approach for determining the structure of membrane proteins in different states.
The paper investigates the relationship between the Lewis blood group antigens (Lewis a and Lewis b) and susceptibility to Vibrio choleraeae infection in Bangladesh. They found that individuals with the Le(a+b−) blood group phenotype were more likely to get symptomatic cholera compared to the other two groups, suggesting that this blood group may be associated with an increased risk of being colonized or infected with V. cholera. Once symptoms develop, individuals with the Le(a+b−) phenotype required less intravenous fluids and had a longer duration of diarrhea compared to those with the Le(a+b) or Le(a− phenotype. The study suggests that the Lewis blood group antigens may influence susceptibility to cholera, but the reasons are not yet defined. The findings suggest that the Le(a+b−) blood group may act as a receptor for V. cholera on the mucosal epithelium, although the non-secretor status may also play a role. The study also found that individuals with the Le(a+b−) phenotype were more susceptible to both cholera and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli infection. The distribution of the Lewis blood group phenotypes in Bangladesh is different from that seen in non-endemic areas, which may suggest that selective pressure for the Le(a+b) phenotype is weaker in cholera endemic regions. The study suggests that including the Lewis blood group antigens in cholera vaccine trials may improve vaccine efficacy.
The paper describes a chemical genomic screen to identify proteins that interact with choline-containing lipids in yeast. The researchers found that a protein called Srf1 is a key regulator of choline-containing lipid metabolism and PLD activity in yeast. They showed that Srf1 is required for the toxicity of choline-containing lipids in yeast and that the delocalization of Spo14, a protein involved in PLD activity, is a result of choline-containing lipid exposure. This suggests that PLD activity is important for protecting yeast cells from the toxic effects of choline-containing lipids. They also showed that the localization of Spo14 and PA is dependent on Srf1 in yeast, and that overexpression of Spo14 can rescue cells from choline-containing lipid toxicity. They propose that Srf1 regulates Spo14 activity by binding to it in a complex in mitotic cells, which in turn regulates PLD activity. They suggest that the mechanism by which PLD activity buffers the toxic effects of choline-containing lipids is likely through hydrolysis of choline-containing lipids, either by directly hydrolyzing them or by signaling their accumulation. The study suggests that targeting PLD activity may be a potential therapeutic approach to mitigate the progression of Alzheimer's disease.
The paper describes how they used a high-throughput screen to identify genetic mutations that affect the localization of a mobile group II intron-encoded reverse transcriptase (LtrA) in E. coli. They constructed a library of mariner transposon mutants that were transformed with an intron-donor plasmid expressing the LtrA protein with randomized target site recognition sequences. They then screened the mutants for altered localization of the GFP/LtrA fusion protein. They found that disruptions of genes that affect the localization of LtrA led to changes in the genomic distribution of LtrB intron insertion sites, consistent with the idea that LtrA localization is a major determinant of LtrB insertion site preference. They identified five genes that affected LtrA localization, including guanosine pentaphosphatase, a polyphosphatase, and three other genes involved in polyphosphate metabolism. They showed that the common factor leading to altered LtrA localization was the accumulation of intracellular polyphosphate, which binds to LtrA and delocalizes it away from the cell poles. They found that this accumulation of polyphosphate also affected the localization of other basic proteins that are normally pole-localized. This suggests that polyphosphate accumulation may be part of a cellular mechanism that relocalizes basic proteins in response to stress or entry into stationary phase.
The paper describes how the cytoskeleton, specifically septins, play a previously unknown role in controlling inflammation and neutrophil clearance during Shigella infection in zebrafish larvae. The authors show that zebrafish septins restrict inflammation and are required for neutrophil-mediated immunity, while neutropenia in septin-deficient larvae makes them more susceptible to Shigella infection. They find that anakinra, an IL-1 receptor antagonist, can rescue septin-deficient larvae from neutrophil death and mortality upon Shigella infection. The zebrafish HBV model is shown to be a valuable system to study the in vivo innate immune response to Shigella infection, as it allows for non-invasive spatio-temporal imaging of the host-pathogen interaction and analysis of the neutrophil response. The findings suggest that targeting the cytoskeleton could be an anti-inflammatory strategy to reduce inflammation and neutrophil death in diseases with a neutrophil component.
The paper discusses the results of a study on Buruli ulcer, a common mycobacterial infection in West Africa. The study found that the time it takes for patients to seek medical care after the onset of symptoms is associated with the severity of the disease. Patients under 15 years old took less time to seek care, while older patients took longer. The study also found that the clinical forms of the disease, such as multifocal lesions, larger lesions and osteomyelitis, were not associated with the time delay in seeking medical care. The authors suggest that the delay in seeking medical care may be related to access to care and healthcare, and not the severity of the disease itself. This highlights the importance of early diagnosis and treatment for severe forms of Buruli ulcer, as the delay in seeking care is associated with the more advanced forms of the disease.
The paper describes a study that tested dogs in kennels in south central Texas for Chagas disease, a parasitic infection caused by the hemoflagellate Trypanosoma cruzi. The study found that 57.6% of dogs in the kennels were seropositive for the parasite, much higher than the 8.8% found in a general population of dogs in Texas. The study also found that older dogs were more likely to be infected, with a 19.6% increase in odds of seropositivity for each additional year of age. The study identified that dogs in kennels were the main reservoir of the parasite and that kissing bugs that fed on the dogs were infected with the parasite. The study highlights the importance of controlling vectors to prevent infection in dogs and congenital transmission to pups. The results suggest that dogs in kennels, particularly working dogs that are intensively trained and have economic value, are a key setting for transmission and highlight the need for vector control measures to prevent infection in dogs.
This paper proposes a theoretical model to describe how gene regulation is controlled through competition between different sigma factors in bacteria. The model describes how sigma factors bind to core RNA polymerase and promoters, form holoenzymes, transcribe genes, and release core RNA polymerase. The sigma factors can compete with each other for core RNA polymerase, leading to a reduction in the number of holoenzymes and thus a decrease in the transcription rate of genes. The model shows that under certain conditions, the release of core RNA polymerase from ribosomal RNA during the stringent response can passively up-regulate the transcription of genes controlled by alternative sigma factors, even if housekeeping sigma factors are in excess. The authors find that non-specific binding of core RNA polymerase to DNA does not buffer the alternative sigma factors against this passive up-regulation. The results suggest that the passive up-regulation of alternative sigma factor-controlled genes during the stringent response may be tuned by the sequestration of housekeeping sigma factors by anti-sigma factors. The model can be used to design synthetic gene circuits that exhibit hyper-sensitive behavior.
The paper discusses the mechanism by which a protein called NoRC positions nucleosomes on DNA. It finds that NoRC specifically recognizes the rRNA gene promoter nucleosomes with higher affinity than other nucleosomes and positions them to the center of the DNA. This positioning of the nucleosomes is thought to be due to the presence of a structured DNA sequence in the promoter. NoRC also interacts with a non-coding RNA that inhibits its activity, which helps to position the nucleosomes at the rRNA gene promoter. The paper shows that NoRC requires linker DNA to position the nucleosomes and that the binding to the nucleosomes is not random but specific. The results suggest that chromatin remodeling enzymes like NoRC function by positioning nucleosomes according to a "release mechanism" where the enzyme binds to nucleosomes at "wrong" positions and then moves them to the correct position through a processive remodeling reaction. This allows chromatin remodeling enzymes to organize chromatin structure according to the underlying DNA sequence. The specific targeting of chromatin remodeling enzymes to specific genomic regions and their ability to position nucleosomes at specific locations helps determine chromatin architecture and regulatory sequences.
The paper describes a chemical genomics screen of Escherichia coli to identify new determinants of antibiotic resistance. They focused on antibiotics with poorly characterized modes of action and resistance mechanisms. They found that the antibiotics kasugamycin and blasticin are imported into bacteria through peptide ABC-importers called oligopeptide permease and dipeptide permease. Deleting these genes makes the bacteria resistant to these antibiotics. The ABC-importers import both kasugamyc and blasticin, but different genes are involved in importing each antibiotic. The study suggests that there is a shared uptake pathway between the two antibiotics in E. coli, but the exact mechanisms may differ between species. The findings could help predict how loss of uptake contributes to antibiotic resistance in different organisms and inform future antibiotic development.
The paper provides an overview of the epidemiology and economic burden of rabies in Kazakhstan. The authors analyzed data on the number of rabies cases in humans and animals in Kazakhstan between 20003 and 2015. They found that cattle had the highest incidence of rabies in animals, accounting for 50% of cases. However, the majority of bite injuries were caused by dogs, which bite multiple times. Vaccinating dogs and foxes was found to be cost-effective in preventing rabies transmission. The paper estimates the economic burden of rabies in Kazakhstan at around $20.9 million per year, with the majority of costs due to PEP treatment. The paper also found that vaccinating livestock did not prevent transmission and may be better targeted towards vaccinating the reservoir hosts, dogs and foxes, to eliminate the disease. Overall, the results suggest that while PEP is cost-effective in preventing rabies deaths, other measures such as targeted vaccination of dogs and foxes may be more effective in reducing the disease burden.
The paper describes an experiment where the authors studied how infants are more susceptible to infections like Streptococococcus pneumoniae than adults. They found that infants have a delayed clearance of pneumoccal colonization from the nasopharynx, which correlates with a failure to upregulate a chemokine called CCL2 that helps macrophages move into the nasopharynx. The authors showed that this delayed clearance is due to a lack of macrophage recruitment, which is caused by the infant's baseline production of high levels of CCL2 in the nasopharynx. They found that this high CCL2 production in the infant nasopharynx is due to the presence of the infant microbiota, which contributes to the elevated baseline CCL2 expression. The authors also showed that restoring CCL2 signaling in the infant nasopharynx by ectopic expression of CCL2 partially restored macrophage recruitment and accelerated pneumoccal clearance. This suggests that the infant's innate immune response to the microbiota may contribute to their increased susceptibility to infections. The study suggests that altered macrophage chemoattractant signaling may be a general mechanism for infant susceptibility to infections.
The paper describes the construction and characterization of two soluble CD4+ T cell receptor tetramers that can specifically bind to Mycobacterium tuberculosis peptides presented on human antigen-presenting cells. The tetramers were constructed from CD4+ T cells that were isolated from patients with active tuberculosis and had high affinity for specific MTB peptides. The tetramers were used to detect and quantify MTB-specific antigen-presenting cells in patient blood and tissue samples. The study showed that there were a relatively low number of MTB-specific monocytes in the blood of advanced tuberculosis patients, which was likely due to the recruitment and apoptosis of APCs. The tetramers could specifically detect MTB-specific macrophages in tissue sections. The study demonstrated that the tetramers could inhibit CD4+ T cell proliferation in response to different MTB peptides, suggesting that they are specific and sensitive. The authors suggest that the tetramers could be used as a diagnostic tool to monitor antigen presentation and immune responses to MTB infection.
This paper investigated how the Trypanosoma cruzi parasite, which causes Chagas disease, deals with oxidative stress. The parasite has a DNA repair machinery to counteract DNA damage caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during its life cycle. The authors found that modifying the expression of an 8-oxoguanine repair enzyme (MutT) from E. coli, which hydrolyzes 8-oxoguanine, allowed the parasite to better resist oxidative stress. This enzyme was expressed in T. cruzi cells through a vector that integrated it into the β-tubulin gene. The cells were found to be more resistant to hydrogen peroxide treatment and had less DNA lesions in their genome compared to unmodified cells. The study showed that expressing the enzyme in T. cruzi allowed the parasite to better cope with oxidized nucleotides in both the trypomastigote and epimastigote forms. The results suggest that an 8-oxoguanine repair activity is important for T. cruzi parasite viability and could be a target for developing drugs against Chagas disease.
This paper describes how a single transcription factor called GRHL3 can control different gene expression programs in two distinct cell types: differentiating keratinocytes and migrating keratinocytes. The researchers used chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) to identify active enhancers and super-enhancers (SEs) in differentiating and migrating keratinocytes. They found that GRHL3 binds to SEs in migrating keratinocytes and activates transcription in these cells, while it binds to TEs in differentiating keratinocytes and represses transcription. GRHL3 also represses non-keratinocyte SEs in differentiating keratinocytes. This suggests that GRHL3 regulates the formation of SEs in a cell type-specific manner. The researchers identified "hub" transcription factors that are close to SEs and whose motifs are enriched within the SEs linked to other epidermal transcription factors, and found that these factors act at specific time points during differentiation. GRHL3 and REST co-regulate genes involved in neuronal and keratinocyte migration. The study shows that regulation of keratinocyte function involves complex interactions between the chromatin landscape and cohorts of transcription factors acting at specific time points during transition processes. The findings indicate that regulation of keratinocyte function involves multiple transcriptional outputs from the same factor to meet the unique physiological needs of each functional state.
This paper discusses how the protein E6 from the human papillomavirus (HPV) helps the virus to maintain itself as an extrachromosomal plasmid in infecting cells. The authors show that the E6 protein is required for HPV genomes to be maintained as extrachromosomal plasmids in human keratinocytes, and that inactivating the protein p53 is sufficient to support this maintenance in the absence of E6. They also find that different E6 mutants have different roles in maintaining the HPV genome. Some E6 mutants can reduce p53 levels, while others can still bind p53 but do not reduce its steady state levels. They conclude that inactivation of p53 is necessary but not sufficient to support HPV maintenance, and that there are likely other functions of E6 that contribute to this process. They propose that E6 may inactivate p53 to prevent apoptosis or senescence caused by the HPV genome. Inactivating p53 also rescues the ability of high-risk HPV genomes to be maintained as extrachromosomal plasmids in the absence of E6.
The paper investigates how the protein POT1a in Arabidopsis thaliana regulates telomere maintenance. The protein POT1a is found to directly interact with the telomerase enzyme TERT and the CST protein STN1, and is required for telomere maintenance. POT1a does not seem to recruit telomerase to telomeres, but instead promotes telomerase activity by stimulating its repeat extension. POT1a binds STN1 directly and mutually excludes TEN1 binding. Once telomerase is recruited to the telomere, TEN1 helps terminate telomerase activity. POT1a is required for telomere extension in the absence of CTC1 or STN1, indicating that it promotes the switch from an unextendable to extendable state. This switch is likely triggered by mobilizing TEN1 from STN1. The interactions between POT1a, STN1, and CTC1 are dynamic and regulated by cell cycle-specific post-translational modifications. The study suggests that modulation of telomerase activity at the chromosome terminus contributes to the bimodal switch in telomere states.
This paper discusses the role of type I interferons in controlling West Nile virus (WNV) infection. The authors found that blocking type I interferons at different stages of infection has different effects on viral replication and immune responses. Blocking type I interferons early, at day 2 after infection, resulted in increased viral burden and rapid death of mice. Blocking type I interferons at day 4 after infection resulted in later effects on immune responses, including depressed cytokine production and changes in CD8+ T cell phenotype. Blocking type I interferons at day 4 resulted in a dysfunctional CD8+ T cell population that appeared to be in an intermediate state between effector and memory. Blocking type I interferons at day 4 also affected antigen-presenting cells, leading to reduced surface expression of CD1a and CD1b molecules. These findings suggest that type I interferons play a key role in the maturation of CD8+ T cells during the acute phase of WNV infection, but have distinct effects depending on when they are blocked. The authors propose that this is due to different cues and cell types involved in priming and activation of CD8+ T cells at early vs. later stages. The results provide insight into the temporal dynamics of CD8+ T cell development and activation during viral infection, and suggest that stage-specific interference of type I interferon signaling may be effective in controlling viral infection.
The paper describes how the protein PRL1 regulates the accumulation of microRNAs in plants. PRL1 interacts with the DCL1 complex and positively regulates the levels of microRNAs. The authors show that PRL1, but not the MAC3B protein, interacts with the DCL1 complex and positively regulates the production of microRNAs. PRL1 also associates with the DCL3 complex and positively regulates the production of siRNAs. The authors propose that PRL1 may stabilize microRNA precursors to promote their maturation. Loss of PRL1 reduces the levels of microRNAs. PRL1 acts additively with CDC5 to promote microRNA levels, which are further reduced in the double mutant cdc5-1 prl1-2 compared to either cdc5-1 or prl1-2. PRL1 also interacts with pri-miRNAs in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that it may stabilize them. The authors propose that PRL1 may act as an accessory factor to regulate DCL1 activity. MAC3B does not seem to play a role in microRNA accumulation, though the MAC complex may play a role in siRNA biogenesis.
This paper investigated how neurons in a secondary auditory area called the Caudomedial Nidopalium (NCM) in zebra finches respond to songs embedded in noise. The authors found that a fraction of the neurons in NCM exhibited a property called noise invariance, meaning their responses to the song were relatively unchanged even when embedded in background noise. They used a technique called a Structure Transfer Function (STRF) to model the neurons' spectral-temporal tuning and found that neurons with higher spectral modulation tuning and lower temporal modulation tuning were more noise invariant. They also found that neurons with these properties were able to detect acoustic features that were common across multiple zebra finch songs, suggesting that noise-invariant neurons could be useful for signal extraction from noise. Based on these findings, the authors developed a noise filtering algorithm that used an ensemble of artificial neurons with tuning similar to those found in NCM. This algorithm was able to effectively filter out noise from songs embedded in noise, outperforming current state-of-the-art algorithms used in hearing aids. The authors conclude that noise-invariant neurons found in NCM are likely the result of a series of nonlinear computations that occurred along the auditory processing stream, and that their tuning properties are well-suited for detecting modulations in noise. The noise filtering algorithm has potential applications in clinical applications like hearing aids and cochlear implants.
The paper discusses a bacterial protein called AnkB that is found in the Legionella pneumophila bacteria. This protein has a unique structure that allows it to hijack a conserved ubiquitination machinery within both mammalian and protozoan cells. It does this by recruiting polyubiquinated proteins to the bacterial vacuole, which is essential for its intracellular proliferation within both types of cells. The bacteria exploits a conserved polyubiquitination machinery that is present in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. AnkB has a non-canonical F-box domain that interacts with a host factor SKP1, which is essential for this process. The authors show that AnkB is the only effector that plays a major role in intracellular proliferation within both protozoan and mammalian cells. They propose a model in which AnkB interacts with SKP1 and recruits polyubiquinated proteins, which are then recruited to the bacterial vacuole. The identity of the polyubiquinated proteins remains to be elucidated. The study provides the first example of a bacterial non-canonical F-box protein that exploits a conserved eukaryotic process to enable intra-vacuolar proliferation within evolutionarily distant hosts and cause pulmonary disease in mammals.
The paper discusses how the accuracy of metagenome annotation, the process of identifying and quantifying the genes present in a community of microorganisms from a sample, can be improved. The authors developed a software tool called Shotgun Metagenome Annotation Pipeline (ShotMAP) to optimize the annotation process. Through simulations they found that factors like read length, choice of gene prediction algorithms, and classification thresholds have a large impact on the accuracy of gene family abundance estimates. They identified best practices for different read lengths, like using gene prediction for shorter reads and per-ORF annotation for longer reads. They also found that sequencing depth is required for accurate estimates of individual gene family abundance, but low-variance estimates of within and between samples can be achieved with relatively small library sizes. They used their software to re-annotate previously published metagenomes and identify new patterns and biomarkers associated with disease. The paper highlights the importance of optimizing annotation parameters for each dataset to achieve accurate results and control false positives.
This paper proposes a new method called ClassTR to classify complex bacterial infections as either clonal heterogeneity or mixed infections. The current approach uses a simple rule based on the number of copies of tandem repeats at multiple loci. The authors propose a new method that uses a model of tandem repeat evolution to classify complex infections. The method resolves complex infections into simpler ones and then assigns a probability that the infection is clonal or mixed based on the similarity of the predecessor sets of the constituent simple infections. The method is able to distinguish between clonal and mixed infections with higher accuracy than the current rule based approach, especially when the mutation rate is higher. The authors argue that this approach will improve our understanding of how bacterial infections evolve within patients and how effective treatments will work. The method also allows for the identification of individual strains within complex infections, which is not possible with the current rule-based approach. The authors propose several ways to improve the model and hope to use future advances in genomics to further validate the method.
The paper discusses how the Epstein-Barras virus (EBV) infects and transforms human B cells, leading to the development of B-cell lymphoma. The authors found that EBV infection represses the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim by reducing the amount of Bim mRNA and protein. They showed that this is due to epigenetic changes on the Bim promoter region, specifically the addition of histone acetyl groups and DNA methylation. EBV infection leads to reduced acetylation of histones H3 and H4 and increased DNA methylation of the Bim promoter. The authors propose that EBV uses the PcG protein family of chromatin regulators to suppress Bim expression, which in turn makes the CpG island available for DNA methylation. The epigenetic changes are inherited by progenitor cells during the pathogenesis of EBV-positive B-lymphoma and continue to be selected for to ensure the repression of Bim. The paper suggests that EBV infection may use the PcG family proteins to interact with cellular DNA methyltransferases to reinforce the repression of Bim expression.
This paper investigates the development of functional connectivity in cortical cultures of neurons grown in vitro. The authors use graph-theoretic analysis and complex network statistics to characterize the topological, spatial and temporal properties of the cultures' networks at different stages of development. They find that the cultures initially have random connectivity, but as they mature, the networks evolve towards a small-world topology that supports efficient information transfer. This is evident from the reduction in burst propagation time and the presence of highly connected clusters. The highly connected nodes and links in mature cultures suggest that hubs play an important role in network activity. The authors conclude that experiments requiring complex network properties should be undertaken from around age 28-35, as earlier ages have limited network maturation. The study provides evidence that cultures can develop non-random network properties without external stimulation and supports the idea that network maturation is an intrinsic property of neuronal development.
The paper discusses how the reproductive behavior of fungi, specifically Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus, affects the diversity of toxins they produce. The researchers found that populations that reproduce more sexually have less diversity in the toxin profiles, while populations that reproduce more asexually have more diversity. They conclude that sexual reproduction tends to equalize differences in toxin production. The study found that the ratio of male to female mating types in a population can be an indicator of whether it is more clonal or sexual, and predicts whether there will be more diversity in the toxin profiles. Sexual populations tend to have lower toxin diversity and more clonal populations, while clonal populations tend to have more diversity in the toxin profiles. This knowledge could be useful for improving biocontrol strategies that target specific populations with different reproductive behaviors.
The paper describes a mechanism by which cells can rapidly and reversibly regulate protein synthesis in response to stress. When cells are exposed to stress, certain RNA molecules called tRNAs are cleaved at their 3'CCA ends. This deactivates them, which in turn represses translation initiation of mRNAs. This mechanism allows cells to quickly and cheaply respond to stress. The cleavage of 3'CCA ends is mediated by the nuclease angiogenin. However, not all tRNAs are affected equally - only those with a specific sequence motif in their anticodon loop are targeted. This leads to the formation of tRNA halves, which can be repaired by a tRNA ligase. The 3'CCA end cleavage is a faster response, while the anticodon cleavage is slower and specific for certain tRNAs. The mechanism allows cells to selectively repress protein synthesis of mRNAs that are controlled by scanning initiation versus mRNAs controlled by IRES. The study shows that cells can use this mechanism to respond to different levels of stress, with more severe stress leading to more global repression of translation. This mechanism allows cells to rapidly respond to stress while maintaining some protein synthesis.
The paper describes how a protein called DAF-16/FOXO regulates the immune response in Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes. The authors found that DAF-16 is activated by physical injury and fungal infection in a way that is independent of the DAF-2 insulin-like signaling pathway. They identified a pathway involving the calcium-binding protein BLI-3, which produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) after injury or infection, leading to the activation of DAF-16. The ROS production is required for DAF-16 activation. They also identified a calcium-releasing mechanism involving the EGL-30-EGL-8 signaling pathway and the IP3/ITR-1 pathway. The study suggests that DAF-16 is an important regulator of immunity in the epidermis and that the production of ROS may play a role in promoting tissue repair. The findings suggest that the DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor could be a potential target for treating epidermal damage.
The paper investigated the role of histone methylation in the fungus Magnaporta oryza. The researchers found that histone methylation is involved in gene regulation in Magnaporta, particularly the epigenetic mark H3K4 methylation catalyzed by the enzyme MoSET1. MoSET1 is responsible for gene activation and is required for infection-related morphogenesis and pathogenicity in Magnaporta. MoSET1 directly or indirectly regulates a large number of genes involved in in infection-related processes, including appressium formation and pathogenicity. The researchers found that changes in histone methylation levels were associated with changes in gene expression, and that H3K4 methylation was more dynamic in genes that were upregulated compared to downregulated. The researchers used mutants to investigate the role of histone methylation in gene regulation and found that loss of histone methylation in MoSET1 resulted in defects in in in infection-related morphogenesis and pathogenicity. The study suggests that histone methylation plays a key role in regulating gene expression in Magnaporta and that MoSET1 is the most important histone methyltransferase involved in in in infection-related processes.
The paper discusses a novel strategy to control trypanosomiasis, a parasitic disease that affects both humans and livestock in sub-Saharan Africa. The strategy involves introducing a Wolbachia bacteria that induces cytoplasmic incompatibility in the tset fly population, making them resistant to the parasite. The Wolbachia bacteria is introduced into the tset population through a transgenic Sodalis. The Wolbachia bacteria also has the potential to induce a fitness cost to the tset, but the modeling suggests that this cost is outweighed by the benefits of reduced transmission of the parasite. The modeling shows that a one-time release of paratransgenic tset can eliminate trypanosomias, provided that the Wolbachia colonization mortality cost is low and the target tset species comprises a large proportion of the tset population. However, the modeling also shows that the size of the paratransgene release determines how quickly trypanosomias can be eliminated, with a larger release achieving this in a year or less while a smaller release taking 6 years or more. The modeling also suggests that different tset species may have different remating rates, which could impact the effectiveness of the paratransgene. The study finds that a multi-species tset population can be controlled by introducing Wolbachia into the species that is most abundant, but this may be challenging as different tset species may have different trapping efficiency and transmission dynamics. The study concludes that while the strategy has the potential to be effective, more research is needed to understand the impact of Wolbachia on tset fitness and the feasibility of releasing paratransic tset.
This paper describes the first characterization of a genetic interaction network in a multicellular organism, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The authors identified six genetic interaction classes, called GIs, that form a heterogeneous group of entities based on various attributes like co-expression, interaction with other genes, and functional effects on phenotypes. They found that two classes of GIs, C4 and C5, tend to interact within protein-protein interaction dense subnetworks (PDS), while the other classes interact between PDS. The GIs within PDS tend to be redundant genes, particularly kinases and PPI-hub genes, and connectors. The authors propose a model in which GIs within PDS coordinate molecular machines within pathways, while GIs between PDS coordinate between pathways. The study suggests that genetic mutations within a pathway may either lead to pleiotropic or non-pleiotropic effects, depending on the type of interaction. The study provides a model for how genetic mutations within a pathway may lead to different phenotypic expressions. The findings demonstrate the value of integrating data from different abstraction levels to identify genetic interaction classes and how they coordinate within pathways.
The paper studies the genetic variation in DNA methylation patterns across different human cell types. It identifies regions of DNA that show a high degree of variation in methylation levels, called "Variably Methylated Regions" or VMRs. These regions are enriched for certain functional features like enhancers and are co-regulated with nearby genes. The VMRs are found to be influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, with some showing increased heritability and enrichment for transcription factor binding sites. The study finds that some VMRs are responsive to environmental cues, such as changes in nutrient availability, cell density and culture conditions. The VMRs show enrichment for genes related to imprinted regions, suggesting they are particularly sensitive to environmental stimuli. The findings suggest that the epigenome can act as an interface between the genome and environment, and that the epigenetic variation in certain regions is linked to environmental factors. The study provides new insights into the causes and consequences of epigenetic polymorphism and its role in disease.
This paper investigated how a progressive loss of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex affects cognitive control and performance monitoring during a task. Two rhesus monkeys were trained on a problem-solving task that tested their ability to search and exploit reward possibilities. The monkeys received progressive injections of a dopamine toxin, which gradually depleted dopamine in the prefrontal cortex over several weeks. The researchers found that while the monkeys' performance on the task remained near optimal throughout the treatment, the electrophysiological markers of performance monitoring (feedback-related potentials) and motivation (beta oscillations) were significantly reduced at the end of the treatment. However, the monkeys' ability to perform the task remained intact. This suggests that the dopamine system has reorganized to provide the necessary information to the control system, even though the feedback-related potentials themselves were lost. The researchers propose that the loss of the feedback potentials is likely a marker of the dopamine lesion, but the monkeys' ability to perform the task indicates that compensatory processes are occurring. The results suggest that the dopamine lesion may have more of an indirect impact on cognitive control and motivation, rather than directly driving performance monitoring and control.
This paper investigated how DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) are repaired in the yeast species Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The authors found that even when the DNA ligase Dnl4, which is essential for non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), is present but inactive due to mutations, it can still promote imprecise non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) when it persists at DSBs. They found that the alternative ligase Cdc9 is recruited to DSBs in a manner consistent with it catalyzing the residual NHEJ in place of Dnl4. The mutations in Dnl4 caused a loss of c-NHEJ in various assays, but the same amount of imprecise NHEJ was observed in the suicide deletion assay and ILV1-cs assay. The residual NHEJ was found to be more mutagenic than the proper c-NHEJ catalyzed by Dnl4. The authors propose that Dnl4 promotes the assembly of the c-NHEJ complex at the DSB, which is then catalyzed by Cdc9. The results suggest that even when Dnl4 is inactive, Dcd9 is still present and can promote NHEJ. The study has implications for human DNA ligase IV syndrome, which shows similar mutations that lead to inactive ligase activity and increased mutagenesis.
The paper found that people who migrated within the past five years are more likely to be diagnosed with leprosy compared to those who have not migrated. Specifically, close family and household contact were the main factors associated with leprosy among migrants, even after controlling for other factors like socioeconomic status and alcohol consumption. Migration in Maranhão was largely facilitated through family networks, so contact surveillance should include migration site residence and current residence contacts. The study suggests that monitoring past five year residence among those newly diagnosed with leprosy could identify areas of high risk for disease spread and provide early warning systems. Alcohol consumption in the years prior to diagnosis may be associated with susceptibility to leprosy, and attention should be given to alcohol consumption during treatment and contact exposure to leprosy. The study highlights that leprosy is not only associated with population movement itself but also with the social conditions of the migrant in the endemic areas and their behavior.
The paper proposes a new method called prepaid estimation for efficiently estimating parameters of complex models that have no analytical likelihood. The method involves generating a prepaid database of summary statistics from extensive simulations across the entire parameter space. These summary statistics are then used to interpolate the parameters for any given data set, allowing fast and accurate estimation. The authors demonstrate the method on three realistic examples: estimating parameters of a species population model, a community dynamics model, and an elementary decision making model. They show that their method is faster and at least as accurate as current methods, but with the added advantage of being able to estimate parameters for a large number of data sets, test the consistency of the method, and reuse simulations. While there are some limitations like the curse of dimensionality, the authors propose ways to mitigate these issues and argue that the benefits of their method outweigh the costs. The paper concludes by discussing potential applications and future directions for improving the method.
The paper describes a study on identifying new chemicals that interact with a commonly used nematicide called aldicarb. The researchers used the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans as a model organism to screen for chemicals that enhance the activity of aldicarb. They identified 20 compounds that interact with aldicarb and found that one of the compounds, wact-86, is metabolized by an enzyme called GES-1, which is expressed in the intestine of the worm. The researchers showed that the interaction between aldicarb and wact-86 increases the potency of aldicarb against the worms, indicating that GES-1 hydrolysis of wact-86 is the likely mechanism of interaction. They also identified 19 other compounds that interact with aldicarb, some of which are likely to interact with GES-1. The study demonstrates that Caenorhabditis elegans can be used as a useful model organism to screen for new chemicals that interact with known nematicides and to understand their mechanism of action. The research provides proof-of-principle for using C. elegans to identify chemical enhancers of nematicides, which could help develop new anthelmintic drugs with reduced toxicity.
The paper describes experiments that show that the stage of development called the extracellular infective stage, or EB, of the bacteria Chlamydia amoebophila is metabolically active and can maintain its own metabolism in a nutrient-free environment. This contradicts the previous belief that the EB stage is metabolically inert. The EB stage is shown to take up and utilize the sugar D-glucose in nutrient-free media. This metabolic activity is important for the EB's ability to infect new host cells and initiate a new intracellular cycle. The study used various techniques such as fluorescence microscopy, mass spectrometry, and ion cyclotron resonance Fourier transform mass spectrometry to investigate the metabolism of the EB stage. The findings suggest that the EB stage has a defined metabolic activity that is linked to its ability to maintain infectivity.
The paper compared two methods for preventing malaria during pregnancy in Malawi, where malaria is a major cause of poor pregnancy outcomes. One method is the standard intermittent preventive treatment with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP) during pregnancy, which has been recommended by the World Health Organization. However, high levels of malaria parasite resistance to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine have emerged in the area. The researchers tested an alternative method called intermittent screening and treatment in pregnancy (ISTp) with artemisinininin-based combination therapy (ACT) in women who test positive on rapid diagnostic tests. The study found that ISTp was not superior to IPTp in preventing adverse birth outcomes such as low birthweight and preterm birth, and was associated with higher rates of malaria at delivery. The researchers conclude that while ISTp may be acceptable and well tolerated, it is not a suitable replacement for IPTp in areas with high levels of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance. The frequent screening required for ISTp may not detect low-level parasites, allowing new infections to develop and persist between scheduled visits. This may explain why ISTp did not perform as well as IPTp in preventing malaria. The study suggests that sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine remains effective despite high levels of resistance and that insecticide-treated nets are important for malaria prevention in pregnancy.
The paper compares the toxicity of two parasiticide drugs, ivermectin (IVM) and moxidectin (MOX). IVM has been used for decades to treat parasitic diseases in humans and livestock, but has been associated with neurotoxicity at high doses. MOX has been evaluated as a possible alternative for human use, but has so far only been tested on a small number of people. The study shows that IVM is more toxic than MOX in vivo, with IVM showing neurotoxic signs at lower doses and MOX showing no toxicity at similar doses. The difference is likely due to the ability of IVM to penetrate the blood-brain barrier more easily and accumulate in the brain more quickly. MOX has a higher lipophilicity and enters the brain more slowly, which limits its toxicity. In vitro, both drugs were shown to interact with the same GABA receptor in a concentration-dependent manner, but MOX had a lower potency and slower dissociation rate, indicating different binding sites. The differences in brain uptake and receptor interaction likely contribute to the observed toxicity differences between the two drugs. Overall, the study suggests that MOX may be a safer alternative for human use due to its lower toxicity.
The paper discusses the results of a pharmacokinetic study of the drug favipiravir during the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa. The study found that the drug concentrations were significantly lower than predicted by a model used to predict drug exposure based on data from studies in healthy volunteers. This was true for both plasma and serum samples. The model was based on data collected at lower doses and shorter treatment periods, and may not accurately predict drug concentrations at higher doses and longer treatment periods used in the Ebola patients. The lower drug concentrations were likely due to the disease itself, which affected drug absorption and elimination. The study suggests that the drug may not have been exposed at sufficient levels to strongly inhibit viral replication, but more research is needed to confirm this conclusion. The study highlights the need for a larger dose-range study to better assess the pharmacokinetics and tolerance of favipiravir at the dosing regimen used in the Ebola patients.
The paper describes a study that aimed to investigate Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infections among US veterans. The study found that most patients were diagnosed in Puerto Rico where they were older and had more comorbidities, resulting in higher rates of hospitalization and death compared to patients diagnosed in other parts of the US. The study highlighted deficiencies in CHIKV testing availability at Veterans Affairs (VHA) facilities, with limited capacity to test all symptomatic patients and underuse of certain tests, particularly in Puerto Rico. The study identified that older age, heart disease, kidney disease, diabetes and lung disease were associated with higher risk of hospitalization among patients diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed CHIKV infection. The findings suggest that adequate laboratory testing, particularly for symptomatic patients and those with severe illness, is needed to monitor patients at greatest risk and inform prevention strategies targeted at high-risk groups.
This paper investigated the relationship between genetic variants and alcohol consumption in relation to colorectal cancer risk. The authors found that a specific genetic variant at 9q232/HIATL1 interacted with light-to-moderate alcohol consumption in a way that reduced colorectal cancer risk. The variant, rs940956, was located in an intergenic region between two genes, HIATL1 and FBP2. Expression levels of HIATL1 were found to be higher in colorectal tumors compared to normal tissue, and expression levels differed between light and heavy drinkers. The authors suggest that this genetic variant may be impacting the expression of HIATL1, which in turn modifies colorectal cancer risk through its influence on HIATL1 expression. The study found that the interaction between rs940956 and light-to-moderate alcohol consumption was not observed with heavy drinking. While the study has limitations, the findings suggest that genetic variants in this region may interact with alcohol consumption to modify colorectal cancer risk, providing insight into the disease etiology. Further studies are needed to confirm and understand the biological implications of this interaction.
The paper describes an investigation into potential methods to prevent the transmission of dengue virus by blocking the mosquito proteins that the virus uses to replicate and transmit itself. The researchers found that two chemical compounds, bafilomycin (BAF) and mycophenolic acid (MPA), can inhibit dengue virus replication in adult mosquitoes by targeting the mosquito proteins that the virus uses to enter and replicate within the mosquito. They tested the effectiveness of these compounds by microinjection into mosquitoes prior to feeding them infected blood, as well as by feeding the mosquitoes the compounds through sugar meals. They found that the compounds were most effective when applied prior to or simultaneously with virus infection, and that the compounds inhibited dengue virus replication in the midgut tissue and salivary glands of the mosquitoes. They also found that two other known alpha-glucosidase inhibitors did not inhibit dengue virus infection in mosquitoes, suggesting that dengue virus may use alternative enzymes. They conclude that vATPase subunits and IMPDH represent potential transmission-blocking targets in adult mosquitoes and that targeting these proteins could be a promising strategy for controlling dengue transmission.
The paper discusses how blocking two immune checkpoint molecules, PD-L1 and CTLA-4, can improve immunotherapy against neuroblastoma, a type of brain cancer. They found that PD-L1 is expressed on neuroblastoma cells and upregulated after exposure to interferon gamma, which can induce resistance to immune cells. They showed that blocking PD-L1 on neuroblastoma cells with an antibody in combination with whole cell vaccination of neuroblastoma cells that have been modified to lack the PD-L1 gene (Id2kd cells) can effectively treat established neuroblastoma tumors. They found that this combination therapy works better than blocking CTLA-4 alone or the whole cell vaccine alone. They also found that low-risk tumors have more T cells and high PD-L1 expression, while high-risk tumors have fewer T cells and little PD-L1 expression, suggesting that blocking PD-L1 may be more effective against high-risk tumors. They propose that this approach could be used to improve immunotherapy against neuroblastoma and potentially prevent recurrence of disease after treatment.
This paper discusses the results of experiments performed to investigate the role of a family of microRNAs called miR-34 in the p53 protein pathway. The p53 protein is a tumor suppressor that helps prevent cells from becoming cancerous by inducing genes that promote cell death or cell cycle arrest when DNA damage occurs. miR-34 is one of the microRNAs that is activated when p53 is stabilized. Previous studies suggested that miR-34 played an important role in the p53 pathway, but the current paper found that deleting the miR-34 genes from mice did not significantly impair the p53 response in vivo or in vitro. The paper generated mice that lacked the miR-34 genes and tested their ability to undergo cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and tumor formation. They found that miR-34 deletion did not significantly slow down the progression of cell cycles or increase tumor formation in response to genotoxic stress. The results suggest that miR-34 is not a crucial downstream effector of p53 in vivo, and that p53 likely has redundant effectors to function. The paper concludes that miR-34 may have p53-independent functions in some contexts, and that further studies are needed to fully understand its role in the p53 pathway.
This paper investigated the role of the zinc finger protein ZC3H30 in the African trypanosome Trypanosoma brucei. The researchers found that ZC3H30 is not essential for the parasite's growth and proliferation under normal conditions, but loss of ZC3H30 makes the parasites more susceptible to various stresses such as heat shock, oxidative stress, and starvation. ZC3H30 associates with stress granules in the parasites and is found in the cytoplasm. However, ZC3H30 does not seem to be highly specific in its binding to mRNAs and does not affect their abundance. Instead, it likely influences translation or localization of the bound mRNAs. The parasites' susceptibility to stress after losing ZC3H30 suggests that ZC30 may play a role in sequestering mRNAs in stress granules. The researchers also found that ZC3H30 associates with the stress granule protein Tb928.3820, but RNA interference of Tb928.3820 does not affect ZC3H30's association with stress granules. The study suggests that ZC3H30 may be involved in protecting mRNAs from stress.
This paper investigates how a genetic mutation in the gene nurf-1 in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans leads to changes in reproduction, lifespan, growth rate, and dauer formation. The mutation causes the worms to prioritize individual survival over reproduction, which is costly in terms of laying fewer eggs later in life. The mutation was identified in a strain cultured in an unnatural liquid medium that has a lower nutrient availability compared to the standard agar plates used for the parental strain. The mutation was then shown to be pleiotropic, affecting multiple traits, and was found to be advantageous in the liquid medium where it arose. The study identified a 60 base pair deletion in the nurf-1 gene as the causative variant. The nurf-1 gene encodes a subunit of the NURF chromatin-remodeling complex, which regulates chromatin remodeling and transcription. The mutation likely allows the worms to divert energy towards survival, leading to the observed changes in life history traits. The study suggests that the nurf-1 gene acts as a pleiotropic regulator of life history trade-offs and could be a useful model to understand how genetic variants impact different traits in other species.
The paper discusses how the emergence of a new lineage of the dengue virus serotype DENV-2 in Brazil in 2007 led to a more severe epidemic in the country. The researchers analyzed the genetic differences between DENV-2 strains isolated before and after 2007 and found that strains circulating after 2007 were more closely related to strains from the Dominican Republic than those from the 190s. They found that strains from 2007-2010 had more amino acid changes in the prM and E genes compared to strains from the 190s, which are associated with increased virulence. The researchers suggest that the introduction of a new lineage of DENV-2 from the Caribbean led to the re-emergence of this serotype in Brazil and the severe epidemic in 2007-2008. They also found that the occurrence of secondary infections may have been a risk factor for more severe cases. The study highlights the importance of monitoring genetic changes in DENV-2 to predict and prevent future epidemics.
This paper discusses the ability of some strains of bacteria to invade non-phagocytic cells by inducing membrane ruffles on the host cell surface, which facilitates their entry. This mechanism of in known as the trigger mechanism of invasion. The authors show that some strains of enteropathogenic Escherichia and enterohemorrhagic E. coli, as well as Citrobacter rodentium, encode a type III secretion system that allows them to translocate effector proteins into the host cytoplasm, which then activate various cell signaling pathways. One of these effector proteins, EspT, was found to induce membrane ruffles and allow bacterial invasion of non-phagocytic cells. They demonstrate that the bacteria associated actin filaments within the endosomes/vacuoles are nucleated in a Tir-dependent manner, similar to the extracellular bacteria. They also show that internalized bacteria can survive and replicate within host cells, and that the associated actin filaments around the vacuoles may protect them from lysosomal degradation. The authors propose that formation of intracellular actin pedestals by invasive bacteria may constitute a physical barrier to lysosome fusion, protecting the bacteria from host immune responses.
The paper describes a method called O2M that can identify potential synergistic drug combinations that act together more effectively than the individual drugs. The method uses a known synergistic drug pair to predict additional synergistic pairs. They tested this approach on the bacterium E. coli and identified 5 new synergistic drug combinations that were not previously known to work together. They then experimentally verified these predictions using cell assays and found that the combination of trimethoprim and AZT (an antiviral drug) was particularly effective against trimethoprim-resistant bacteria. They also found that floxuridine +AZT was more effective than trimethoprim + sulfamethizole against trimethoprim-resistant bacteria. This suggests that synergistic drug combinations could potentially bypass antibiotic resistance. The method has the advantage of using FDA-approved drugs as starting points, which could reduce clinical trial costs. The authors hope that this approach could lead to the development of new antibiotic treatments for multidrug-resistant infections.
The paper describes a mouse model that demonstrates how a lack of a protein called Filamin B (FBLN) leads to progressive fusion of the spine and degeneration of the intervertebral discs. The authors found that mice lacking FLNB have increased signaling through the TGFβ and BMP pathways, which leads to premature differentiation of cartilage cells in the growth plates and fusion of the vertebrae. The fusion occurs first in the thoracic spine and then progresses to the lumbar spine. The cells in the intervertebral discs transform from fibroblastic cells to chondrocytes, leading to disruption of the disc and fusion of the flanking vertebrae. The increase in TGFβ signaling leads to premature hypertrophy and matrix degradation, ultimately resulting in fusion of the flanking vertebrae. The authors suggest that FLNB plays a key role in regulating and attenuating TGβ and BMP signaling in tissues during postnatal development to maintain normal morphological boundaries. The findings provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying spinal fusions and degenerative disc disease, which may lead to the development of new therapeutic solutions.
The paper discusses the discovery of a gene in a giant virus called Mimivirus that has two internal stop codons in its sequence, allowing it to bypass the stop codons and produce a full-length protein through two different recoding events - readthrough and frameshifting. This gene, called R726, was initially annotated as a class-I peptide release factor but was found to contain both readthrough and frameshift stop codons. The authors showed through experimental and computational analysis that these stop codons are read through and produce a full-length protein, although they are not pseudogenes. They suggest this gene may have evolved in the giant virus lineage independently of the host genome, allowing it to produce its own translation termination factors. This is an unusual occurrence of a regulatory mechanism in translation termination that is typically found only in bacteria. The study highlights the complex and unique features of giant viruses and their genetic makeup.
The paper investigates how the ability to generate random sequences, which relies on cognitive functions such as attention, inhibition, and working memory, changes across the lifespan. The authors developed five random sequence tasks that are different in terms of their cognitive demands, ranging from simple to complex. They recruited 349 participants across various age groups (4-91) and had them perform each task. They found that the tasks are correlated in terms of the level of complexity they require, indicating that they tap similar cognitive abilities. The tasks also show a developmental curve, with a dip in complexity and speed in the middle age range and a later increase in complexity but decrease in speed. The authors found that sex and paranormal beliefs affect performance in some tasks. The tasks provide complementary information about cognitive abilities. The results show that even short, computerized random sequence tasks can still provide useful information about cognitive functions like algorithmic complexity, which is related to probabilistic reasoning. The findings shed light on how age-related changes in this ability are likely due to a combination of fluid and crystallized components of cognition.
The paper proposes a new model to explain how the human uterus coordinates repetitively contracts during labor. The model suggests that the contractions are coordinated through a combination of electrical activity and mechanotransduction. The model uses a cellular automaton to simulate the behavior of the tissue, dividing the uterus into regions that can either be in an electrically active or passive state. The model shows that the regions communicate through pressure changes, with pressure increases recruiting other regions to contract. The model can reproduce the observed pressure profiles of the uterus during labor. It also shows that the number of regions and the sensitivity of each region affect how coordinated the contractions are, with more coordinated contractions occurring at around 18-30 regions. The model suggests that the concept of a stable pacemaker is not necessary and that the pacemaker role is more complex and emergent, based on the interactions between the regions. The model can help us better understand how the different parts of the uterus work together to coordinate labor. The authors encourage further refinement and investigation of the model to better understand how the mechanisms contribute to normal labor and how to treat abnormal patterns.
The paper investigates the cellular organization of the Planctomycetes bacteria, specifically the species Geitlerinobacterium obscurigus. Previous studies suggested that this species had a nucleus-like double membrane system that surrounded its genetic material, but the authors found that this is not the case. Instead, the cells have a complex endomembrane system that is not compartmentalized, but rather a simple expansion of the periplasm by invaginations of the inner membrane. The cells have an extensive network of membranes within the cytoplasm, with spaces created by these invaginations that are interconnected. The genetic material is free to move between the two cell volumes, the cytoplasm and the periplasm. The authors conclude that the membrane organization in G. obscurigus is not fundamentally different from that of Gram-negative bacteria, but a complex variant of it. The findings suggest that the PVC bacteria may have evolved from a classical Gram-negative bacterium through a gradual expansion of its membrane system. The study provides evidence that the endomembrane system of G. obscurigus is involved in endocytosis, which is a strictly eukaryotic process, and that it shares similarities with eukaryotic membrane coat proteins. The authors propose that the PVC bacteria may represent an intermediate stage in the evolution of eukaryotic cells.
The paper discusses how two different subtypes of CD4+ T cells (Th2 cells) were found to be expanded in people with subclinical filarial infections (asymptomatic individuals) compared to those with filarial lymphedema (CLP). These two subtypes are IL-5 expressing Th2 cells and IL-5 non-expressing Th2 cells. The IL-5 expressing Th2 cells were found to be associated with higher eosinophil counts and IgE and IgG4 antibody levels, suggesting they play a role in promoting eosinophilic inflammation and immune defense. The IL-5 non-expressing Th2 cells were found to be associated with lower eosinophil counts and IgE and IgG4 levels, suggesting they play a role in promoting antibody responses. The study suggests that the expansion of these Th2 subtypes in subclinical infections may be important in protecting against the development of filarial lymphedema. The study also found that the expansion of these subtypes was dependent on the continued presence of parasite antigen in vivo, as seen in people who cleared the infection following treatment but still had high levels of parasite antigen. The findings suggest that the IL-5 expressing Th2 cells may play a role in promoting innate immune defense, while the IL-5 non-expressing Th2 cells may play a role in promoting adaptive immunity.
The paper discusses how viruses like rhinovirus, which belong to the Picornavirus family, infect the respiratory tract and cause diseases like asthma exacerbations. The researchers investigated how viruses like rhinovirus recognize and respond to cells in the respiratory tract. They found that two types of receptors, TLR3 and RNA helicases, are important for recognizing viruses and triggering the production of interferon and cytokines in response. TLR3 is required to induce RNA helicases RIG-I and MDA5, which are important for recognizing and responding to viruses. The researchers showed that TLR3 and RNA helicases work together to induce interferon beta and cytokines early in in in infection, before viral replication increases. This helps control the amount of virus in the cells. Later in in infection, interferon beta and lambda are also produced and contribute to the response. The study provides evidence that TLR3 and RNA helicases are important for the innate response to rhinovirus infection in human bronchial epithelial cells, which are the main cells infected in the respiratory tract. The results suggest that TLR3 and RNA helicases work together to recognize viruses in a coordinated manner, with TLR3 sensing viruses early in endosomes and RNA helicases sensing viruses in the cytoplasm. This dual system helps the cells respond to viruses early and control replication. The findings may help identify new targets for treating rhinovirus-induced diseases like asthma exacerbations.
The paper describes a mathematical model that attempts to explain how microtubules and neurofilaments segregate in axons. The model suggests that the segregation is caused by the failure of neurofilaments to interact with microtubules, allowing organelles to zip microtubules together and push them apart. This leads to microtubules clustering in the center and neurofilaments in the periphery. The model is able to reproduce the observed patterns of segregation seen in animal studies. The authors propose that the rate of segregation depends on factors like the size and movement rate of organelles, and that selective impairment of neurofilament transport is the key mechanism that leads to this segregation. The study provides insights into the factors that influence the rate of segregation and how it relates to neurofilament accumulation and axonal swelling, which are seen in many neurological diseases. While the modeling is a first step, the authors believe that a combination of experimental and modeling approaches will be needed to fully understand the underlying mechanisms.
The paper discusses how cells in response to external signals, called chemotaxis, polarize in a process called polarization. Researchers used microfluidic experiments to study this process in HeLa cells. The experiments showed that cells polarize in a gradient of a signaling molecule, like Rac, by creating a wave of activity that stalls and leads to a polarized cell. The researchers developed a theoretical model of the process to complement the experiments. They started with the simplest model, which showed that a single GTPase coupled to PIs through positive feedback could polarize the cells. However, more complex models that included other GTPases like Cdc42 and Rho were also needed to accurately describe the experimental results. The final model, called Model 4, consisted of three GTPases and incorporated mutual inhibition between them. The model showed that cell geometry could influence the response threshold, and that changing the surface area to volume ratio could stabilize polarization. The researchers found that PI feedback reduced sensitivity to stimulus gradients, which supports the idea that PIs act upstream of GTPases. The model also showed that the ratio of surface area to volume affected the signalling. The model was able to capture many aspects of the experimental observations and provided insights into the behavior of the GTPase-PI pathway.
This paper studied the population genetics and demographic history of the triatomine bug Rhodnius nasutus in the Caatinga biome of Brazil. The researchers collected 147 cytb sequences and 157 microsatellite sequences from 53 Copernicia prunifera palm trees in 8 locations across the region. They found that Rhodnius nasutus populations in the Caatinga exhibit high genetic diversity, with 15 polymorphic sites and 16 haplotypes shared between different locations. The cytb sequences grouped into 4 distinct clades, while the microsatellite sequences grouped into 4 genetic groups. The demographic history of Rhodnius nasutus inferred from cytb sequences suggested an exponential population growth model, consistent with the global climate changes during the Holocene. The genetic structure of Rhodnius nasutus populations indicated that populations expanded from west to east through the region, with Group 1 in the west acting as a source population and Groups 2 and 3 in the east acting as sinks. The reduced genetic diversity in Groups 2 and 4 suggests that populations in the east may have experienced reduced connectivity due to habitat fragmentation. The paper concludes that Rhodnius nasutus populations have the ability to adapt to new microhabitats and colonize new areas, which could impact Chagas disease control efforts.
The paper presents a new discrete model of precartilage mesenchymal cell patterning in limb development that is more realistic than previous models. The model represents each cell as a multipixel object that can change shape and move in the third dimension, rather than a single pixel. This allows for cells to round up and condense without losing their shape. The model also uses two grids for cell and molecular dynamics, allowing for different diffusion rates for cells and molecules. The model was calibrated with experimental parameters from related studies, and was able to reproduce the distribution and size of precartilage condensations in micromass cultures. The model also showed that cells can form patterns under conditions where they move less than a cell diameter and maintain a uniform cell density, consistent with in vivo observations. The model demonstrated two regimes of reaction-diffusion dynamics in morphogen production, with one regime producing stationary patterns and the other producing transient patterns. The results suggest that cells in the transient regime form patterns through cell rearrangement and fibronectin production, while cells in the stationary regime form stable patterns. The ability to generate both spot and stripe patterns from the same parameters provides further support for the model. The model provides a framework for studying other periodic patterning processes involving cell movement and shape change.
This paper investigates how changes in mRNA stability and degradation rates contribute to the rapid reprogramming of the transcriptome in response to changes in nitrogen availability in yeast cells. The authors used a pooled mutant screening approach to identify genetic factors that regulate mRNA stability in response to a nitrogen upshift, where nitrogen is added to nitrogen-limited cells. They found that a subset of mRNAs, including those encoding transporters and metabolic enzymes, are destabilized in response to nitrogen addition, which allows the cell to rapidly reallocate translational capacity. They identified the Lsm1-7p/Pat1p complex and decapping modifiers as key factors that mediate the destabilization of the mRNAs, and found that the destabilization occurs through cis-elements in the 5' UTR. They also found that accelerated mRNA degradation is not limited to NCR-regulated mRNAs but also targets transcripts involved in carbon metabolism pathways, particularly pyruvate metabolism. The results suggest that accelerated mRNA degradation plays an important role in reprogramming the transcriptome in response to changes in nitrogen availability and could potentially serve an adaptive function to free up ribonucleotides or translational capacity.
The paper discusses the epidemiology of Japanese Encephalitis in the Philippines. It found that the disease is endemic in the country, with cases reported across all regions and age groups. Most cases occur among children under 15 years of age, and there is a significant mortality rate of 6-7%. However, the actual number of cases may be higher due to underreporting. The paper suggests that a one-time vaccine campaign targeting children under 15 followed by inclusion of the vaccine in the routine program would be appropriate, as this age group is most at risk.  and has the highest proportion of clinical cases. Improved surveillance is needed to better quantify the burden of the disease. The Philippine government has plans to expand sentinel surveillance and laboratory confirmation to provide baseline data for vaccine impact.
The paper describes how a viral protein called vIRF-1 from Human Herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) is able to inhibit the pro-apoptotic protein Bim by inducing its nuclear localization, which in turn inhibits Bim's ability to induce apoptosis. vIRF-1 can bind to Bim and prevent it from functioning in the cytoplasm, allowing it to accumulate in the nucleus where it can no longer induce apoptosis. The study shows that vIRF-1:Bim interaction is important for productive replication of HHV-8 and that disrupting this interaction through peptide-mediated inactivation of vIRF-1 can inhibit HV-8 replication. The paper suggests that targeting vIRF-1:Bim interaction may provide a useful antiviral strategy.
The paper discusses how the poxvirus MVA is recognized by innate immune cells in macrophages. The authors found that the TLR2-TLR6-MyD8, MDA-5-IPS1 and NALP3 inflammasome pathways are the main pathways that recognize MVA and induce a cytokine response in macrophages. They found that TLR2 and MyD8 are necessary for the production of IL-1β, while the NALP3 inflammasome is required for the processing of pro-IL-1β into mature IL-1β. They also identified RIG-I and MDA-5 as key sensors of MVA. They showed that the production of cytokines and chemokines by MVA-infected macrophages depends on TLR2-TLR6-MyD8 and MDA-5-IPS1, but not TLR9. They also found that endocytosis of MVA is required for the production of IL-1β. The results suggest that the TLR2-TLR6-MyD8 and MDA-5-IPS1 pathways play a critical role in the immune response to MVA and may help design new vaccine vectors with improved immunogenicity.
The paper discusses the role of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in regulating cell proliferation and tissue patterning in the Drosophila intestine. The authors found that Wnt signaling is enriched at compartment boundaries in the adult intestine and that Wnt pathway activation is essential for proper cell fate specification at these boundaries. They discovered that enterocytes are the primary sites of Wnt pathway activation during adult homeostasis, and that Wnt signaling in enterocytes non-autonomously regulates the proliferation of neighboring intestinal stem cells. When Wnt signaling is inactivated in enterocytes, the JAK-STAT pathway is activated in neighboring intestinal stem cells, leading to non-autonomous overproliferation. The authors propose that Wnt signaling acts as a "brake" that must be bypassed or turned off during regeneration following injury to prevent the inappropriate activation of the JAK-STAT pathway. Wnt signaling may also be required to prevent the inappropriate activation of this critical response during homeostasis. The study highlights the importance of Wnt signaling in maintaining tissue organization and proper cell fate specification at compartment boundaries in the intestine, particularly at the R5-HPZ boundary.
The paper describes how the researchers used zebrafish embryos to study the development of muscle fibers in a vertebrate model system. They used time-lapse microscopy and quantitative analysis to identify three distinct phases of muscle fiber development: short muscle precursor cells, elongating cells, and myotubes. They found that lamin proteins are required for efficient muscle fiber elongation and organization. They showed that lamin proteins are needed for cells to stop extending when they reach the muscle tissue boundary, which they called "muscle tissue junction" or MTJ. They also found that fast-twitch muscle cells do not fuse to form multinucleate myotubes prior to elongation, but instead elongate and then fuse to form the myotubes. They showed that lamin proteins are needed for both the initial attachment of muscle fibers to the basement membrane and the proper organization of the myotubes. The findings provide insight into the cellular mechanisms that underlie muscle fiber morphogenesis in vertebrates and demonstrate the value of using quantitative methods to study this complex process.
The paper discusses how the presence of domestic animals in human sleeping quarters can affect the host-feeding choices and transmission risks of Triatoma infestans, a vector of Chagas disease. The researchers found that the presence of chickens and dogs in homes significantly lowered the proportion of Triatomine bugs that fed on humans, resulting in lower human-bug feeding rates and contact rates. This supports the hypothesis that the presence of chickens and dogs acts as zoopotentiation, reducing the transmission risk of Chagas disease through the vectors. The study showed that domestic bugs fed mostly on humans in spring, but when chickens were allowed to nest indoors in spring, the proportion of bugs that fed on humans decreased. The estimated human-feeding rate per household was high, with an average of 7.2 contacts per person-day. The researchers conclude that measuring the threshold human-feeding rate for transmission of vector-borne diseases is difficult due to uncertainties in vector abundance, host exposure, and the probability of human infection given a feeding contact. The presence of chickens and dogs in human sleeping quarters has a profound impact on the dynamics of Triatoma populations, host-feeding choices, and transmission risks. Appropriate animal husbandry practices combined with environmental modifications and insecticide spraying may be necessary for sustainable vector and disease control.
This paper shows that a gene called M36, which blocks the death-receptor signaling pathway, is essential for a virus called cytomegalovirus (CMV) to grow and be virulent in immunodeficient mice. It is found that macrophages, which are immune cells that are important for controlling the virus in the body, are responsible for this inhibition. M36 allows CMV to grow in macrophage populations by blocking apoptosis of infected cells, which in turn protects the virus from the antiviral effects of macrophages. Macrophage depletion rescues CMV growth in immunodeficient mice, showing that M36 is necessary for CMV to grow in the absence of immune cells. The authors propose that M36 may present an excellent target for antiviral therapies.
This paper proposes a new method called nonparametric Bayes ensemble learning (NBEL) to predict protein-protein interactions based on data from multiple sources. The current methods that predict protein interactions, like naive Bayes and logistic regression, have high false positive and false negative rates. NBEL learns the distributions of interacting and non-interacting protein scores from different data sources and adaptively weights the data sources to better predict protein interactions. This reduces the misclassification rate and predicts more protein interactions. The authors tested their method extensively through simulations and found that NBEL predicts more protein interactions than naive Bayes and logistic regression, and has a lower false positive rate. They also validated their method on two high-quality experimental datasets. The results suggest that NBEL can be used to reliably predict protein interactions, which can be useful for studying protein functions and disease susceptibility.
This paper uses a new algorithm to comprehensively map bidirectional promoters in the human genome using spliced expressed sequence tags (ESTs). They identified 565 bidirectional promoters, which are pairs of genes arranged head-to-head on opposite strands within 100 base pairs of each other. They found that a subset of these promoters regulate genes implicated in breast and ovarian cancers, and contain transcription factor binding sites in common. The promoters were found to have a strand-specific pattern of nucleotides that could bind regulatory proteins. The bidirectional promoters were found to be associated with genes that are frequently implicated in DNA repair, and misregulation of these promoters may play a role in cancer. The authors suggest that misregulation of bidirectional promoters could extend beyond breast and ovarian cancers and be a general mechanism for disrupting genetic functions. They propose that bidirectional promoters be explored as targets of aberrant methylation, which could impede the binding of regulatory proteins and affect similar sets of genes.
This paper proposes a treatment for hypocortisolism, a condition where the body has a low level of the hormone cortisol. Hypocortisolism is associated with chronic fatigue syndrome, major depression, and other conditions. The authors use a mathematical model of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis) to analyze the hormone dynamics and propose a treatment that involves suppressing cortisol levels until ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone) concentrations exceed 30% of baseline. This indicates the HPA axis has shifted to a new stable state. The cortisol suppression is then discontinued, and the HPA axis returns to its normal state. The cortisol concentration could be manipulated by reducing its bioavailability, inhibiting cortisol synthesis at the adrenal gland, or inhibiting CRH (corticotropin-releasing hormone) synthesis at the pituitary. The treatment aims to stimulate the production of ACTH and bring the HPA axis to a healthy steady state. The approach is based on model-based predictive control, which can estimate the most appropriate treatment parameters for an individual patient given the uncertainty in the model. While the specific treatment proposed in the paper is model-dependent, the general model-based predictive control approach is robust and could be used to estimate the best treatment parameters for a given patient.
This paper investigated the effectiveness of a single dose of azithromycin in eliminating trachoma infection in children under 9 years old in a village in Tanzania. Despite high coverage of azithromycin (95%), the prevalence of trachoma infection remained at 10.4% at 6 months after treatment. The authors found that children who were infected at baseline were more likely to still be infected at 6 months, indicating that a single dose of antibiotic may not be enough to eliminate the infection. The number of infected children in the household was also associated with a higher risk of infection at 6 months. Children aged 2-4 were at a higher risk of infection post-treatment, regardless of their baseline infection status. The study suggests that mass treatment should be continued in these communities to achieve the goal of eliminating trachoma. The authors recommend at least three annual treatment rounds to achieve this.
The paper investigates whether repeated endurance training in the same limb leads to a "skeletal muscle memory" effect, where the muscle remembers some of the benefits of previous training after a break. The authors found that while there were some consistent changes in gene expression between the two legs after the second training period, there was no clear evidence of a skeletal muscle memory effect. They observed some differences in the gene expression between the two legs after the first training period, but these were not maintained after a 9-month break. However, when comparing the two legs after the second training period, there were some consistent differences in gene expression between the two, indicating that the training effect was specific to the trained leg. The authors also found that many novel transcripts were expressed in response to the endurance training, some of which were differentially expressed between the two legs. These findings suggest that there may be a molecular mechanism that allows the muscle to "remember" previous training, but the study did not find conclusive evidence of a skeletal muscle memory. The authors conclude that more controlled studies are needed to evaluate within-subject variability in response to repeated exercise.
This paper discusses how plants regulate their growth and development based on light exposure. The study found that two types of photoreceptors called cryptochromes (CRY1 and CRY2) in Arabidopsis plants can detect light and initiate signaling pathways that control plant growth. The photoreceptors interact with a complex called the COP1/SPA complex, which inhibits growth factors that are degraded in the dark. When exposed to blue light, CRY1 and CRY2 interact with COP1, leading to the degradation of these growth factors and subsequent growth. The study found that CRY1 requires a protein called SPA1 to interact with COP1, while CRY2 can interact with COP1 independently. SPA1 acts as a "bridging" protein that enhances the interaction between CRY1 and COP1. In contrast, CRY2 interacts with COP1 independently of SPA1. The study also found that COP1 interacts with CRY1 in darkness, but only the interaction with SPA1 enhances the interaction between CRY1 and COP1. The findings suggest that COP1 primarily recognizes the active conformation of CRY1 and CRY2, which is achieved through light-induced phosphorylation.
The paper proposes a new approach to identify protein-protein binding sites by decomposing domains into modules based on their modular structure. The authors found that domains that interact with different binding sites are usually decomposed into different modules. Within modules, there is cooperativity between residues, indicating that they are specialized for binding. They found that modules with high modularity values, which measures the number of within-module connections and the number of connections between modules, often contain binding site residues. The combination of modularity and conservation or patches improves the accuracy of identifying binding sites. They found that modules containing binding sites often have a modular architecture with distinct hotspots located in different modules. The modular organization of binding sites helps to explain the robustness and flexibility of protein-protein interactions. The authors suggest that this approach could be used to design drugs that target specific binding sites. In summary, the modular decomposition of domains provides insights into the functional organization of binding sites and the advantages of cooperative regions for protein-protein interactions.
The paper describes a mathematical model of the circadian clock in Drosophila melanogaster, which is a biological clock found in many organisms that helps regulate their internal rhythms. The model focuses on the two feedback loops in the clock: the period loop involving the proteins PER and TIM, and the clk loop involving the proteins VRI and PAR. The model shows that the period of the clock depends on the amount of the PER protein and the clk protein, but not the actual concentration of CLK protein. The model also shows that the nuclear localization of PER and TIM proteins can occur independently of their concentration, but a positive feedback loop helps produce the correct timing of nuclear localization. The authors found that the simple mass action model of the per/tim loop is inconsistent with experimental observations, but an additional feedback loop or large number of intermediate phosphorylation states can produce the switch-like dissociation of cytoplasmic PER-TIM underlying the interval timer. The positive feedback model was introduced to the framework and is consistent with observations of the relationship between per dosage and circadian period. The model shows that independent transfer of PER and TIM by simple mass action kinetics is inconsistent with experimental observations, but an additional feedback loop can produce stable oscillations when positive feedback is employed. The results suggest that the oscillation of CLK activity, not concentration, is necessary for circadian rhythms.
The paper discusses the discovery of Larrea tridentata, a plant commonly known as creosote bush, as a source of natural antiparasitic compounds that can treat intestinal parasites like Giardia lamblia and Entamoeba histolytica. The researchers surveyed traditional medicines used by Mexican and Southwestern American cultures and identified seven compounds from Larrea tridentata that showed antiparasitic activity against the three parasites. Compounds 1 and 2 were found to be the most effective against N. fowleri, with EC50 values of 36 and 59 μM, respectively. They were shown to inhibit cysteine protease activity in N. fowleri lysate, which may be the mechanism of action. The authors hypothesize that the hydrophilic nature of compounds 7 and 8 may limit their diffusion into the parasite, explaining their inactivity. Compounds 1 and 2 were found to be less toxic to human cells compared to N. fowleri, suggesting potential therapeutic potential. The discovery of these Larrea tridentata compounds represents a new class of natural products that could be optimized through medicinal chemistry to develop more effective drugs for amebias, giardiasis and PAM.
This paper investigated the effectiveness of a multidisciplinary approach to treating dizziness in middle-aged and older adults. The study found that a comprehensive assessment of dizziness symptoms and tailored interventions based on individual needs improved dizziness handicap scores compared to standard care. The interventions included vestibular rehabilitation, balance training, cognitive behavioral therapy, and medical management for symptoms. While the study found some individualized therapies were effective, the overall effect size was relatively small. The multidisciplinary approach allowed for better diagnosis and treatment planning by combining evidence-based therapies to address different aspects of dizziness. However, factors like low initial dizziness severity, poor uptake of certain interventions, and participant beliefs about the condition contributed to the limited effectiveness. The study provides evidence that a multifactorial approach to assessment and treatment may be beneficial for reducing self-perceived disability associated with dizziness in community-living older adults.
The paper describes a study that aimed to understand how visual information flows between the two visual streams in the brain, specifically between the dorsal and ventral streams, when viewing 3D objects. The dorsal stream is responsible for processing depth information while the ventral stream is responsible for processing visual details. The researchers found that an area in the dorsal stream called the caudate intraparietal sulcus (CIP) plays a causal role in the ventral stream's ability to process 3D objects. They showed that inactivating CIP in monkeys resulted in a reduction in the ventral stream's ability to detect depth structure in objects, as measured by fMRI. This effect was observed in the anterior intraparietal sulcus, caudal intraparietal sulcus, posterior intraparietal sulcus and inferior temporal cortex. The results suggest that CIP may be the first stage in the dorsal stream that computes changes in disparity along a surface, and that its activity affects the ventral stream's ability to perform depth categorization. The findings provide insight into the neural basis of 3D object vision and how the dorsal and ventral streams interact to process visual information.
The paper investigated how people control their movements to maximize expected gain while taking into account temporal uncertainty. They had people perform a task where they had to touch a computer screen within a specific time window. They added noise to the timing of the target and measured the noise in the subjects' movements. They found that the people were able to compensate for the added noise and still maximize their expected gain. They compared the people's movements to a model that incorporated temporal uncertainty and the added noise, to models that only took into account some aspects of the temporal uncertainty. They found that people were able to choose the optimal time to maximize their expected gain, even though the models that only considered part of the temporal uncertainty were not able to do so. This suggests that people are able to take into account the temporal uncertainty they experience during movement planning and execution, which is important for tasks that require timing accuracy.
The paper discusses the emergence and disappearance of two different serotypes of Vibrio cholerae causing cholera outbreaks in an endemic area in India. While the Ogawa serotype was the primary cause of cholera for most of the study period, there was a shift in 2006 to the Inaba serotype, which was associated with larger outbreaks. Genomic analysis showed that the Inaba isolates had different mutations in the gene responsible for the Inaba serotype, which could explain their persistence. The emergence and disappearance of these lineages was not random and may have been triggered by specific factors. The high conservation of the gene responsible for the Inaba serotype, the wbeT gene, suggests that it plays an important role in the persistence of cholera, but the ease with which mutants can be isolated under certain conditions may allow the Inaba strains to persist. The study provides valuable insights into the more complex dynamics of cholera in endemic areas and highlights the possibility that the serotype shift is not the only factor driving persistence, but the gene itself may have additional functions. Further research is needed to understand the factors contributing to the persistence and spread of cholera.
The paper discusses the role of two proteins called coagulases in the ability of Staphylocococcus aureus bacteria to cause disease. Coagulases are proteins that help convert fibrinogen to fibrin, which can form clots. The study shows that two types of coagulases, Coagulase and von Willebrand factor-binding protein, are secreted by Staph aureus and contribute to the development of abscesses and staphylococcal infections. The researchers found that mice immunized with antibodies against these coagulases had improved survival and reduced abscess formation compared to mice immunized with only one of the coagulases. This suggests that both coagulases are important for staphylococcal infections. The study concludes that immunizing against both coagulases, rather than just one, may be needed for a vaccine to protect against the current strain of Staphylocococcus aureus that are resistant to antibiotics.
This paper investigated typhoid fever in children in rural Cambodia using a combination of epidemiological studies, genome sequencing and spatial analysis. They found that there was a large burden of typhoid fever in children in rural Cambodia, which contradicts the common belief that typhoid fever is primarily found in urban areas with poor sanitation systems. They identified several subtypes of Salmonella Typhi that were circulating in the population and found that proximity to Tonle Sap Lake and access to water in the household were protective against typhoid fever. They suggest that immunizing school-aged children before the wet season may be the most effective approach for introducing vaccines to control the disease, given the seasonal pattern of typhoid cases and the association with lake water contamination. They found that two communes near the lake had the highest incidence of typhoid fever and clusters of cases. Further studies are needed to examine the specific sanitation-associated risk factors and exposures that may contribute to typhoid outbreaks in these regions. While the findings provide valuable insights, the study has some limitations due to the data being from a single healthcare facility and lacking individual-level information.
The paper describes the development of an inactivated human enterovirus 7 (EV7) vaccine candidate for hand, foot and mouth disease. The vaccine was developed using an inactivation method that leaves no residual inactivant and completely eliminates viral infectivity within 24 hours, making it more efficient than formalin inactivation. The purified antigen preparation was shown to elicit neutralizing antibody responses in mice and was found to be well tolerated in a repeated dose toxicology study in rabbits. The two dose levels tested, 0.6 and 3.0 μg, were found to be effective for inducing a protective antibody response. The vaccine was later tested in AG129 mice, which are susceptible to EV7 infection, showing partial protection against morbidity and mortality. The results suggest that an inactivated EV7 vaccine has potential advantages over live attenuated vaccines, including that it cannot revert back to a more pathogenic form and immune responses can be manipulated. The efficacy of the vaccine could be improved by including a coxsackievirus A16 strain, which is another major cause of HFMD. The development of an EV7 vaccine is encouraging, especially in developing countries where the economic value of vaccination is high compared to the risk of the disease.
The paper describes a new assay to study the entry of HIV-1 into cells. The assay involves delivering a reporter gene encoding a luciferase protein into cells after viral cores have entered them. The researchers found that the amount of luciferase produced in response to the reporter gene depends on the state of the viral cores, with two main species of cores observed: those that are accessible to translation and those that require high doses of a compound called PF74 to open up. The PF74-dependent luciferase activity reflects the presence of infectious viral genomes, while the basal activity reflects non-functional opened cores. The researchers showed that reverse transcription does not expose the viral genome to the cytoplasm, but rather viral cores remain in the closed form. The proportion of PF74-dependent luciferase activity decreases when cells are stimulated with IFN-alpha, indicating an IFN-induced activity that destabilizes viral cores. This suggests that the viral cores retain their ability to protect the genome from the cellular environment even after reverse transcription. The assay provides new insights into the early steps of HIV infection and how the virus interacts with cells.
The paper discusses how the protein RNase L, which is activated by double-stranded RNA, helps control virus replication in mice infected with the gliotropic mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-JHM). The study found that mice lacking the RNase L gene (RL-/-) were more susceptible to infection and had increased mortality compared to normal mice (wild type). The increased susceptibility was not due to uncontrolled virus replication or spread to neurons, but rather due to accelerated demyelination and axonal damage in the brain stem and spinal cord. The virus infected microglia and macrophages in the spinal cord, which lacked RNase L, showed increased levels of viral antigen and apoptotic cells. The increased susceptibility was also associated with a more severe demyelination and axonal damage. The study suggests that RNase L may provide protection from focal infection of microglia and macrophages in the CNS, but does not play a role in protecting oligodendrocytes or neurons. The results highlight the importance of subtle alterations in viral tropism in affecting the balance between neuroprotection and neurotoxicity by microglia/macrophages.
The paper proposes a new method for modeling and controlling zoonotic diseases, specifically brucellosis, by using a layered network model that captures the transmission dynamics across multiple animal and human populations. The model allows for the representation of surveillance and control capabilities within the animal population and transmission from animals to humans. The authors use network control theory to design control strategies that can allocate limited resources to achieve high performance, while taking into account the heterogeneity in transmission between different populations. The approach can identify optimal subdivisions of resources among the animal populations and compare different control strategies. The results show that vaccination of transhumance herds can reduce the basic reproductive number, while surveillance and culling can quickly eliminate the infection. The methodology can also identify the tradeoff between allocating resources to animal and human populations. The authors hope that this approach will help develop comprehensive control policies for zoonotic diseases, which will need to be tested and evaluated in practice.
The paper describes a study on using a target repurposing approach to identify potential drugs for treating African trypanosomiasis. The researchers identified a series of established drugs that target mTOR/PI3K in human cells and tested their activity against African trypanosomatids. They found that the most potent compound, NVP-BEZ25, showed significant inhibition of Trypanosoma brucei growth and extended the survival of infected mice. While the exact mechanism of action is unclear, the results suggest that inhibition of multiple trypanosomal PI3Ks may be involved, likely including TOR. The study validates the target repurposing approach and provides a promising starting point for further development of new drugs for trypanosomiasis. However, more work is needed to determine the mechanism of action and efficacy of NVP-BEZ25 against Leishmania.
The paper examines how trypanosomes respond to heat shock and how this relates to their development and differentiation. The study shows that after exposure to heat, some mRNAs move from non-translated to polysomal fractions, indicating increased translation. This is particularly true for mRNAs that bind to the protein ZC3H1, which are already highly translated at normal temperatures. However, mRNAs that bind ZC3H1 are less likely to move into heat shock granules, suggesting that ZC3H1 protects these mRNAs from degradation and incorporation into granules. The study also found that mRNAs that increase in abundance after heat shock tend to encode proteins involved in translation, chaperones and RNA-binding proteins, and are more likely to be associated with polysomes. In contrast, mRNAs that decrease in abundance after heat shock encode ribosomal proteins, which are already highly expressed and not well-associated with polysomes. The findings suggest that heat shock may promote differentiation and translation, but not necessarily differentiation directly. Heat shock may enhance developmental transitions by enhancing translation and protein synthesis, rather than directly inducing differentiation.
The paper discusses how the host environment at the site of infection can influence the effectiveness of antibiotics in treating bacterial infections. The authors found that lung epithelial cells can secrete metabolites that enhance the activity of certain antibiotics against bacteria. They grew lung epithelial cells as 3D structures in vitro and found that the secreted metabolites from these 3D cultures potentiated the activity of certain antibiotics against bacteria. This was found to be due to an increase in the bacterial membrane potential, which allows for higher antibiotic uptake. The authors also found that the metabolic activity of the lung epithelial cells themselves influenced the effectiveness of the antibiotics, as culturing the cells in a way that increased metabolism resulted in higher antibiotic uptake. They conclude that the host microenvironment plays an important role in determining antibiotic effectiveness and that enhancing host metabolism may be a way to improve antibiotic treatment.
The paper describes a new technique called PAR-CLIP that allows researchers to map the position of polymerase II (Pol II) termination sites in living yeast cells. Pol II termination plays an important role in transcriptional regulation and is subject to different mechanisms depending on whether the terminators are polyadenylated (pA) or non-pA. The authors used PAR-CLIP to deplete components of the pA and non-pA termination machinery and then crosslinked Pol II to nascent RNA to map the position of termination sites. They found that pA termination sites were located within 50-150 base pairs of the pA site while non-pA termination sites were located further downstream. They identified specific motifs that were associated with the different termination mechanisms and showed that different factors were involved in the pA and non-pA termination pathways. The paper highlights the different roles of the factors Nrd1 and Sen1 in the pA and non-pA termination pathways, respectively. The results demonstrate the power of using PAR-CLIP to map termination sites genome-wide and shed light on the mechanisms of termination.
The paper discusses the role of a protein called p10α in promoting cell survival through the phosphorylation of a receptor protein called Ser585 in response to low levels of cytokines. The authors found that p10α, a component of the PI3K enzyme, directly phosphorylates Ser585 in the cytoplasmic tail of receptors, leading to the activation of downstream signaling pathways that promote cell survival. They identified this mechanism through experiments in human AML cells and showed that inhibiting p10α activity using siRNA or inhibitors resulted in a decrease in Ser585 phosphorylation and increased apoptosis. This pathway appears to be independent of the lipid signaling activity of PI3K and is only activated by low concentrations of cytokines, which can activate protein kinase activity but not lipid activity. The results suggest that p10α may be a promising target for cancer therapy, as p10α mutations are rare in AML but constitutive PI3K lipid signaling is common in AML. The authors propose that the ability of PI3K to switch between kinase and lipid activity allows two distinct modes of signaling, each linked to a distinct cellular outcome. Further research on other protein substrates of PI3K that are constitutively phosphorylated in cancer may reveal useful biomarkers and therapeutic targets for PI3K-pathway drug development.
The paper describes a study on the transcription termination process in yeast cells. The researchers used whole-genome transcriptome analysis to investigate how different proteins affect the termination of transcripts in yeast cells. They found that the protein Sen1 plays a central role in termination, while other proteins like Nrd1, Nab3, Ssu7, Rpb1 and Hrp1 also have some effect. However, the study found that the activity of Sen1 is required for efficient termination of most short transcripts, while the other proteins affect only a subset of Sen1-dependent transcripts. The study identified several new targets of Sen1-dependent termination, including protein-coding genes that were not previously known to be regulated by this pathway. The study also found that the Sen1 pathway regulates expression of some genes by attenuating transcription, rather than by transcription termination. The researchers also found that the Sen1 pathway affects some genes during meiosis, suggesting it plays an important role in the meiotic cell cycle. Overall, the study provides new insights into the complex mechanisms by which the Sen1 pathway regulates transcription termination and identifies new targets of this pathway.
This paper discusses how cancer cells may develop resistance to targeted therapies, which are drugs that specifically target cancer cells. The authors model the emergence of resistance by cancer cells as a stochastic process with birth and death rates that depend on the current cancer cell population size and the drug concentration. They derive analytical approximations for the probability of resistance and the expected size of resistant cells under different dosing schedules. They show that the probability of resistance depends on the growth rate of sensitive cells during therapy, which is in turn related to the current sensitive cell population size and growth rate. They then propose a methodology to design dosing strategies that minimize the number of resistant cells and delay disease progression. They test the sensitivity of their methodology to different constraints on the growth and death rates of sensitive and resistant cells, as well as the degree of convexity of the toxicity curves that define the maximum drug concentrations that can be tolerated. They argue that a high-dose pulsed strategy can be optimal for slowing tumor growth in some cases where it is impossible to reduce the sensitive cell population. The paper highlights the importance of estimating the growth and death rates of sensitive and resistant cells under different drug concentrations to inform the design of targeted therapy dosing schedules and maximize the time before disease progression.
The paper discusses the results of a study on the six superoxide dismutase (SOD) genes encoded by the Paracoccidioides genus of fungi. The study found that different Paracoccidioides species have different numbers and expression levels of SOD genes. The PbSOD3 gene was expressed at higher levels in yeast cells of some Paracoccidioides species, suggesting that it may be important for protecting yeast cells against endogenous and exogenous oxidative stress during growth and host infection. When the researchers knocked down the PbSOD3 gene in Paracoccidioides cells using antisense RNA, they found that the cells had reduced vitality and were more sensitive to oxidative stress. They also found that Paracoccidioides cells that express PbSOD3 are more susceptible to phagocytic cells like neutrophils, suggesting that PbSOD3 helps Paracoccidioides cells evade phagocytosis. The study suggests that PbSOD3 may play a role in the establishment and dissemination of Paracoccidioidosis in the host, while PbSOD1 may be more important for respiratory infection. The authors propose that PbSOD3 may be essential for Paracoccidioides virulence, while PbSOD1 may be important for dissemination.
This paper describes a standardized endocystomy technique for surgically treating uncomplicated hepatic echinocococcosis, a parasitic disease caused by the larval stage of Echinococococcus granulosis. The technique involves carefully positioning the patient, mobilizing the liver, and evacuating the cyst content through a series of steps including ultrasound examination to confirm the cyst location and size, using sponges to control spillage of cyst content, removing the cyst wall, and closing any bile ducts. The technique was used in 21 patients with isolated hepatic echinococococcosis, mostly from endemic regions, with a median of 2 cysts per patient and a median of 47 cysts removed in total. The technique was found to have a low rate of complications (14.2%), similar to that of radical surgery, and no recurrences were observed during the 2-3 year follow-up period. The technique appears to be effective and safe from a surgical point of view, but longer follow-up is needed to determine the recurrence rates. The authors suggest that perioperative benzimidazole prophylaxis may help prevent recurrence in the event of spillage, but the efficacy of this treatment remains unclear. The close collaboration between specialists in different fields was key to developing the technique and treating patients.
This paper discusses a new potential anti-Ebola virus drug called H84T BanLec. It has been shown to inhibit Ebola virus infection in cell cultures and mice, with the highest doses providing partial protection from lethal infection. The exact mechanism of action is not yet fully understood, but it is thought to involve blocking both entry and transcription/replication of the virus. H84T inhibits Ebola virus infection more strongly than it inhibits entry, which suggests it may have a mechanism of action that targets both steps of the virus life cycle. While H84T is most effective against the Makona strain of Ebola virus, it also shows some activity against another strain called Mayinga. The authors suggest that H84T may have potential as an empirical treatment for Ebola virus infections, particularly if used in combination with vaccines, as a single dose of the drug could partially protect mice from lethal infection. However, more research is needed to understand why H84T is more effective against some viruses than others and how it works at a molecular level.
The paper investigates the developmental trajectory of multisensory integration in children, specifically the integration of visual and auditory information. The researchers found that children as young as 4-5 years old do not show optimal integration of the two modalities, instead they switch between them based on their relative reliabilities. They used a simple counting task where children were asked to count the number of flashes or beeps presented. The results showed that children as young as 4-5 years old had a weaker prior knowledge of the stimulus statistics and were more variable in their estimates, which suggests that they did not yet have the ability to integrate the two modalities optimally. The integration emerged around 10 years of age, as older children were able to weight the modalities appropriately and had smaller cross-modal interactions. The study suggests that the lack of integration in young children may be beneficial for recalibration and development, as it allows the sensory system to constantly adjust to changing sensory inputs.
The paper describes the discovery of a distinct population of neurons in the lateral hypothalamus called NtsLH that are responsible for regulating sleep-wake, thermoregulation and metabolism. The authors found that NtsLH neurons are distinct from orexin and MCH neurons in the LH and express neither MCH nor orexin. They used optogenetic and chemogenetic approaches to demonstrate that NtsLH neurons specifically activate wakefulness and increase thermogenesis, while inhibition of NtsLH neurons reduces wake and thermogenesis in response to stress. The activation of NtsLH neurons also caused hyperthermia and hyperactivity, suggesting that they may play a role in cold defense mechanisms. The authors propose that NtsLH neurons act as an "orchestrator" that modulates the activity of orexin and MCH neurons depending on the perceived stressors and generates appropriate stress responses. The results suggest that NtsLH neurons play a critical role in modulating sleep-wake states, LMA and Tb in response to physiological and metabolic demands and may contribute to cold defense mechanisms.
This paper discusses how the structure of a population affects the evolution of strategies in a population, and how the fitness of individuals depends on who they interact with. The authors show that the fitness of individuals does not depend on the composition of the population, but rather on who they interact with. They derive a formula that allows them to determine the factor by which one strategy is more abundant than another in the limit of weak selection, given the population structure, size, mutation rate, and update rule. This factor can be calculated numerically using a simple algorithm. They demonstrate the formula by applying it to several examples, including a model of cooperation in a structured population, and show good agreement between the formula and analytical results. They also show that allowing individuals to belong to at most sets, rather than exactly sets, can be beneficial for cooperation in some cases.
The paper describes a new algorithm called GlobalFit that can automatically modify a metabolic network model based on inconsistencies between model predictions and experimental growth/non-growth data. The algorithm is able to simultaneously reconcile multiple experiments and growth conditions in one step, finding a minimal set of changes that resolves all inconsistencies. The GlobalFit algorithm is able to find multiple optimal or suboptimal solutions, allowing users to select the most biologically realistic modifications based on additional experiments or expert knowledge. The authors demonstrate the utility of the algorithm by applying it to genome-scale metabolic models of Mycoplasma genitalium and Escherichia coli, finding improvements in accuracy compared to previous methods. The key idea is to use a bi-level optimization approach, solving the inner and outer problems simultaneously to find a globally optimal solution that minimizes the number of network changes while also satisfying the experimental data.
The paper describes a new mechanism by which the brain is able to localize sounds along the horizontal plane. It is found that the brain uses the difference in the time of arrival of sounds between the two ears to determine the position of a sound along the horizontal plane. This is achieved through a mechanism where the brain can distinguish microsecond differences in the arrival time of sounds at the two ears, which is referred to as interaural time differences (ITDs). Low frequency sounds are most useful for detecting ITDs and animals with sensitivity below 150 Hz tend to perform best at this perception. In the brain, this computation is performed by specialized neurons called medial superior olivary neurons (MSO neurons) in the auditory brain stem. MSOn neurons receive two sets of excitatory inputs from each ear and detect ITDs when both inputs arrive within a narrow time window. When inputs arrive asynchronously, the MSOn neurons do not respond. The ITD response function is then constructed by representing the variation in MSOn neuron discharge rate with the relative delay of the two inputs. The paper finds that an ITD encoding mechanism is based on an arrangement of axonal delay lines. However, in vitro preparations show that MSOn neurons have a longer response latency for the contralateral pathway compared to the ipsilateral path. This difference in path length is not compensated for by an axonal property. The authors propose that an asymmetry in the rising slope of excitatory inputs, which determines the firing probability of the MSOn neurons, can compensate for this difference in path length and position the ITD response function within the physiological range. The paper demonstrates this through experiments and a computational model that shows that an asymmetry in EPSP slope can bias the ITD response function towards the ipsilateral leading side.
This paper describes a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and replication of genetic variants related to high levels of IgE antibodies in a population of German adults. The study identified a new susceptibility locus for high IgE levels, which is located on chromosome 1 and encodes the alpha chain of the high affinity receptor for IgE (FCER1A). The gene FCER1A. The top associated variant, rs24273, was found to have an estimated effect of -0.12% decrease in IgE levels for the rare homozygote genotype and 0.12% for the heterozygote genotype. The study also identified variants in the RAD50 gene, which encodes a DNA repair protein, as potentially contributing to IgE levels. While the RAD50 variants showed associations, the study could not rule out that the effect was due to the nearby IL13 gene. The study found that variants in the FCER1A gene were associated with increased expression of the FCER1A receptor on basophils, which is important for IgE-induced type 1 hypersensitivity reactions. The study suggests that genetic variants in the FCER1A and RAD50 genes may play a role in regulating IgE levels and highlights the need for further functional studies to confirm the findings.
The paper describes the identification and characterization of a novel chagasin-like protein, Cip1, from the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000, that inhibits immune proteases in the plant apoplast. Cip1 was identified by screening a large collection of putative apoplast effectors from Pseudomonas species. The authors used competitive activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) to test if Cip1 inhibits the immune protease C14 of tomato, which it was shown to do. Cip1 was expressed heterologously in E. coli as a soluble protein and purified for further studies. The authors found that Cip1 inhibits both the mature C14 and an intermediate form of C14, as well as the immune protease Rcr3, but inhibits Rcr3 less efficiently. Cip1 contributes to the virulence of PtoDC3000 on tomato, providing protection against secreted host proteases that would otherwise suppress bacterial growth. The authors propose that Cip1 is an important virulence factor that manipulates the apoplast by infection.
This paper explores the role of Parp3 in B cell diversification through the generation of antibody repertoire mechanisms involving somatic hypermutation. It is found that Parp3 is required for proper CSR, but not for SHM and affinity maturation. Parp3 negatively regulates CSR by controlling the level of AID on chromatin. This is seen in that Parp3-deficient B cells show increased AID occupancy at the IgH locus, which results in increased DNA damage at switch regions. Parp3 also favors the classical NHEJ pathway of DSB repair, which is consistent with its role in promoting accurate repair of DSBs. The increased AID occupancy at the IgH locus in Parp3-deficient cells is not due to faster loading kinetics, but rather Parp3's ability to reduce AID occupancy. This suggests that Parp3 acts as a negative regulator of CSR. Parp3's control of AID occupancy on the chromatin is sufficient to explain the increased CSR observed in Parp3-deficient cells. The paper reconciles previous findings showing that enhanced CSR is specific to a Parp3 deficiency, and excludes the possibility that the effect is due to increased AID transcription or sub-cellular localization.
This paper proposes a theoretical model of the brain as a network of interconnected nodes, using the Kuramoto model to study how changes in network structure and dynamics can lead to seizures. The authors analyze EEG recordings from patients with epilepsy and controls to identify differences in network structure that may predict seizure onset. They find that the critical coupling strength for synchronization is lower in epilepsy networks, indicating a tendency towards seizures. They also find that certain nodes, particularly those in the frontal brain regions, can drive increased global synchronization when self-synchronized, which supports the idea that generalized seizures may arise from activity in these regions. The approach has potential to be used in real-time as a diagnostic tool for clinicians treating epilepsy and other neurological disorders, and can identify candidate nodes that may drive seizure activity. The study demonstrates that changes in network structure and dynamics can be used to predict seizures at the individual level, despite limitations in the data and model.
The paper discusses a new vaccine candidate for cholera that uses two virulence factors from Vibrio cholerae, cholera toxin and toxin-coregulated pilus. The two factors, cholera toxin and toxin-coregulated pilus, were shown to be essential for cholera virulence in mice and humans. The researchers tested whether immunizing mothers with a recombinant form of these factors as a chimera or separately could protect infant mice against cholera challenge. They found that the chimera form, which includes both cholera toxin and pilus as a complex, was more effective at protecting infant mice against cholera challenge than immunizing mothers with either factor alone. The chimera form was able to elicit intestinal antibodies in infant mice, which is important for protecting against cholera infection. The study suggests that using a chimeric form of these factors in a vaccine could provide effective protection against cholera in humans, potentially extending beyond the currently available vaccine. However, more research is needed to assess the efficacy of this approach in humans and to optimize the vaccine formulation and delivery.
The paper studies how long it takes for drug-resistant HIV viruses to revert back to their wild-type form in the absence of antiretroviral drugs. The researchers found that different mutations have different fitness costs, which affect how quickly they revert. They used machine learning to predict the fitness cost of each mutation based on the amino acid sequence. They found that the fitness cost of the mutation, both the mean cost across all backgrounds and the residual cost, significantly influenced how quickly the mutation reverted. They also found that mutations that had different fitness costs in different backgrounds contributed more to the variation in reversion rates than mutations with different overall fitness costs. This suggests that the genetic background of a resistance mutation has a large impact on how quickly it reverts. The study highlights the importance of understanding the fitness costs of drug-resistant mutations in order to predict and prevent the spread of antimicrobial resistance in the real world.
This paper discusses how variations in the genes that encode natural killer cell receptors, called KIR genes, can affect how many of these receptors are expressed on individual cells. The researchers found that variations in the genes that control the expression of these receptors, called promoters, can lead to differences in the frequency of expression of different KIR genes on individual cells. They identified specific genetic variations in the promoters that control the expression of four KIR genes (KIR3DL1, KIR2DS4, KIR2DL3, and KIR2DL5). These variations were found to affect the expression frequency of different KIR genes on individual cells, with certain variations leading to higher or lower expression levels of certain KIR genes. They showed that the variations in the promoters were associated with differences in the activity of the reverse promoter, which in turn affected the forward promoter and gene expression. The study found that the expression of some KIR genes was more strongly associated with the frequency of expression of the corresponding alleles. The researchers suggest that these variations in KIR promoter activity may play a role in determining the ability of natural killer cells to detect and eliminate infected cells. The study provides a basis for further investigation into how variations in KIR genes affect disease susceptibility and resistance.
The paper discusses the results of a genome-wide association study (GWAS) that identified two genetic variants associated with follicular lymphoma (FL), a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). The variants are located in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region and are thought to affect the efficiency of antigen presentation by B cells. The two variants are rs26472 and rs10456, which are associated with FL risk. The study found that the association of rs26472 with FL is independent of the previously identified variant rs10456, suggesting that there may be two different genetic variants that contribute to the development of FL. The study also found that the variant rs10456 is associated with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL, a different type of NHL. The findings suggest that HLA class II molecules play an important role in the pathogenesis of both FL and DLBCL, and that there may be a link between autoimmune diseases and NHL. The study provides evidence for the importance of studying the HLA region for understanding the genetic basis of NHL and its subtypes.
The paper discusses the genetic mechanisms behind antimony resistance in Leishmania parasites, specifically in the Viania subgenus. The authors used whole genome sequencing to identify genetic changes in four antimony-resistant mutants of Leishmania guyanensis. They found that the mutants had amplified or deleted genomic regions on chromosomes 19 and 23, which contained genes associated with antimony uptake and resistance. The deletion of a gene coding for an aquaglyceroporin called AQP1 was particularly common, which likely contributed to the antimony resistance. They also found that a point mutation in the AQP1 gene at position 398 led to reduced antimony uptake and resistance. The study highlights differences in genetic mechanisms between Leishmania and Viannia parasites, with Leishmania parasites showing more extrachromosomal amplifications and Viannia parasites showing intrachromosomal amplifications. The loss of AQP1 in the mutants restored antimony sensitivity, suggesting that it is not essential in Leishmania. The study suggests that the AQP1 gene may be a key target for antimony resistance and that genetic changes in other genes related to volume regulation and transport could also contribute to resistance.
This paper identifies a new mechanism that allows melanoma cells to survive oncogenic stress. The authors found that a gene called RhoJ, which is involved in cellular signaling pathways, allows melanoma cells to proliferate when they have a mutation in the BRAF gene. RhoJ mutations are not seen in normal cells, but they are present in melanoma cells. Deleting the RhoJ gene in mice causes the melanoma cells to have a lower tumor burden and reduces the growth of melanoma tumors. Treating mice with a drug that inhibits RhoJ signaling leads to reduced tumor growth and longer survival. The authors suggest that inhibiting RhoJ signaling may be a potential therapy for early stage melanoma, as it can halt tumor growth and metastasis. The study suggests that RhoJ is part of a signaling pathway that allows melanoma cells to survive and proliferate when they have a BRAF mutation, and that inhibiting RhoJ may be more effective than targeting the BRAF mutation directly.
The paper discusses a new class of enzymes called MprF that are found in many bacteria that can synthesize a lipid called lysyl-phosphatidylglycerol (Lys-PG) that makes bacteria resistant to host antibiotics. The enzymes have two parts, a hydrophobic domain that synthesizes Lys-PG and a hydrophilic domain that translocates the lipid to the outer membrane. The hydrophilic domain is found to be essential for translocating Lys-PG but not necessary for Lys-PG synthesis. The hydrophilic domain alone cannot confer antibiotic resistance. The two parts can be separated into two functional proteins that accomplish the synthesis and translocation functions. The study shows that MprF proteins are bifunctional and can synthesize Lys-PG and translocate it to the outer membrane. The findings suggest that inhibitors of MprF proteins could be developed to make many bacteria susceptible to human antibiotics, providing new strategies for antibacterial chemotherapy.
This paper discusses how Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacteria that causes tuberculosis, has five clusters of highly conserved genes that code for specialized secretion systems called ESX-7SS. These systems are important for exporting key mycobacterial factors that play a role in host-pathogen interactions. The authors have found that genetically modifying mycobacteria to express or delete certain ESX7SS genes can create promising vaccine candidates. They created a vaccine candidate called Mtb Δppe25-pe19 that lacks five ESX7SS genes encoding PE/PPE proteins, but still has a functional ESX7SS system. They found that this vaccine candidate induces cross-reactive T-cell immunity against the same PE/PPE proteins as the wild-type strain, despite lacking the specific genes. This cross-reactivity is mediated by the functional ESX7SS. The Mtb Δppe25-pe19 vaccine also secretes ESX1 substrates that trigger host immunity and induces stronger T-cell responses against ESX1 substrates. The paper argues that immunity to PE/PPE proteins is a relevant factor for protection against TB. The authors conclude that PE/PPE proteins represent potent immunogens to be included in TB vaccines or used as boosters. The MTB Δppe25-pe19 vaccine candidate has a unique combination of properties that make it a promising new vaccine candidate.
The paper describes the development and testing of a new drug that targets a protein called a 3CLpro, which is found in many different coronaviruses. The drug, called GC376, was shown to be effective in treating feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) in cats when given at advanced stages of the disease. This suggests that the drug may have potential to treat other coronavirus infections, even when treatment is started late. The drug was found to be safe and well-tolerated in cats and was effective at reducing viral load in macrophages and ascites from infected cats. The drug also showed good activity against different coronaviruses, including feline infectious peritonitis, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. However, the drug did not select for resistance in cats, suggesting it may be difficult for the virus to evade drug binding while still performing its function. These findings provide evidence that targeting the 3CLpro with a small molecule inhibitor could be an effective approach for treating coronavirus infections, even when treatment is started late.
The paper investigates whether genetic autozygosity (the proportion of a person's genome that exists in runs of homozygous SNPs) is associated with schizophrenia. The authors analyzed genetic data from 17 schizophrenia case-control studies using 17 different platforms, imputed SNPs, and raw SNP data. They found that the proportion of a person's genome in runs of homozygous SNPs, called "Froh," was associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia. Specifically, they found that for every 0.01 increase in Froh, the odds of schizophrenia increased by 17%. The association was observed across all SNP thresholds used, suggesting that both distant and close inbreeding may contribute to schizophrenia risk. However, they were unable to definitively distinguish between the roles of distant and close inbreeding as causes of the association. The results suggest that schizophrenia risk alleles are more recessive than expected, which could mean that alleles that increase schizophrenia risk have been under purifying selection. The study shows that genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism data can be used to investigate the effects of distant inbreeding, which was previously difficult to do using only pedigree data. However, large sample sizes are needed to reliably detect the effects of autozygosity.
The paper discusses how genome reduction can occur through large-scale deletions of accessory genes, rather than small genome shrinkage, and how this can lead to adaptations in bacteria. The authors studied this phenomenon in Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 by evolving populations in different environments with varying nutrient availability. They found that 80% of the genomic regions that were deleted were lost across 32 populations, indicating that these deletions were under selection. The deletions were found to have fitness benefits in the selective environments, with the largest deletions removing 24.7% of accessory genes and 2.7% of core genes. The benefits were found to be specific to the environment in which they occurred, suggesting that the genes lost were not simply beneficial due to a shorter genome. The results suggest that selection-driven loss of accessory genes can lead to a restricted niche and limited genome change, rather than drift-driven loss of genes. This is consistent with observations of chronic infections and opportunistic pathogens. The study highlights the potential for selection-driven, large-scale deletions of unnecessary genes to lead to adaptations in bacteria, which may have tradeoffs with growth capacity and stress responses.
The paper found that people with diabetes have a higher risk of developing active tuberculosis compared to those without diabetes. However, the risk of developing tuberculosis was not uniform across all diabetes patients. The study found that people with poor glycemic control (high blood sugar levels) had a higher risk of developing tuberculosis compared to those with good glycemic control (low blood sugar levels). The study suggests that improving glycemic control in diabetes patients may help reduce the risk of developing tuberculosis. However, the exact mechanism is not fully understood. Improved immune function and reverse of immune dysfunction in diabetes may play a role. The study also found that better glycemic control was associated with better clinical outcomes in other infections and reduced infectious complications. The authors suggest that improving glycemic control in diabetes patients may help reduce the tuberculosis burden, especially in populations with high prevalence of diabetes and low TB detection rates.
The paper discusses how three species of fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, Drosophila simulans, and Drosophila mauritiana, were able to rapidly evolve resistance to parasitoid wasps, which parasitize their larvae. The researchers found that resistance to the parasitoid wasps came at a cost to the flies' ability to compete with other flies in resource-rich environments. The flies had to increase the number of circulating immune cells in their bodies to fight off the parasitoid infection. However, this increase in circulating immune cells came at a cost to their larval competitiveness, causing their survival in resource-poor environments to be significantly lower. The researchers conclude that the cost of resistance is likely driven by the resource competition, rather than just parasitoid pressure. The flies' ability to evolve resistance is thus linked to their resource availability, not just the parasitoid pressure. The different species evolved resistance in different ways, with some moving immune cells from clusters to circulation and others increasing the total number of immune cells. The study suggests that evolving resistance is costly and may require diversion of resources from other functions into immune defenses, which could explain why genetic variation in susceptibility to infection is maintained in nature.
This paper evaluated various immunodiagnostic tests for detecting Schistosoma japonicum infections in China. Most of the tests had good sensitivity and specificity, but the IHA_XY test had lower specificity. The EITB test from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the USA was found to be highly sensitive and specific for detecting Schistosoma japonicum infections, especially in low transmission areas. The other tests were less specific and had high cross-reactivity with other parasitic infections. The paper identified the EITB test as a possible method for definitive serodiagnosis of Schistoma japonicum infections. However, it noted that more sensitive tests are needed to avoid misidentifying individuals with low level infections who pose a transmission risk. It also emphasized the importance of easy-to-use, rapid, robust, user-friendly tests that can be delivered to end-users in field settings with limited resources. The paper recommended the IHA_JX, DIGFA_SH and ELISA_SZ tests for further field trials based on their acceptable performance and ease of use.
This paper describes a new mouse model that allows researchers to study female genital schistosomiasis (FGS) and its associated immune response and potential increased susceptibility to HIV infection. The authors developed a mouse model where they injected Schistosoma haematobium eggs directly into the vaginal wall of female mice. They found that the eggs induced inflammation and granulomas in the vaginal submucosa, which is similar to human FGS, but did not cause significant systemic immune modulation. The granulomas contained immune cells such as T cells, macrophages and eosinophils, which could be potential targets for HIV infection. The model showed that FGS resulted in increased urinary frequency in mice, which is similar to human FGS. The authors suggest that the model could aid in studying the evolution of FGS lesions, immune response and susceptibility to HIV, and may be useful for developing treatments. However, the model has limitations as it does not fully replicate the human disease and does not cause vaginal mucosal lesions. A humanized animal model of FGS would be more informative.
This paper proposes that a protein called CAPER acts as a master regulator of cellular metabolism. It is highly conserved across eukaryotes and plays a crucial role in maintaining a balance between carbon and nitrogen metabolism. When cells lack CAPER, they experience metabolic defects such as impaired glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation, which leads to a shift towards the Warburg effect and the accumulation of amino acids. This in turn causes oxidative stress and eventually cell death. The study shows that CAPER regulates the expression of genes involved in glycolysis, the TCA cycle and fatty acid oxidation, and is required for the maintenance of mitochondrial function. The results suggest that CAPER acts as a master regulator of cellular metabolism that allows cells to optimize their energy metabolism and nitrogen metabolism in response to changes in nutrient availability, and thus promotes cellular survival. CAPER is upregulated in cancer cells, which suggests that it may play a role in cancer progression.
This paper describes a study that aimed to identify genetic loci associated with kidney traits in African Americans. The researchers analyzed genetic data from 4000 African Americans and 800 European Americans using genotyped on the IBC array and the Affymetrix 6.0 chip. They found three genetic loci associated with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), urinary albuminuria (UACR) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The genes closest to the identified loci are KCNQ1, DOK6 and FNDC1. The researchers also performed functional studies in zebrafish to investigate the effects of knocking down the corresponding genes on kidney development and function. They found that loss of KCNQ1 leads to abnormalities in glomerular gene expression and filtration, while loss of DOK6 and FNDC1 does not. These results suggest that KCNQ1 may play an independent role in renal development and function in African Americans. The study highlights the potential for genetic loci associated with polygenic chronic conditions to produce developmental phenotypes when knocked down in vivo. The study demonstrates that analyzing genetic variation in African ancestry populations can identify novel loci that may contribute to chronic kidney disease. However, the power was low to detect genetic associations with odds ratios less than 1.2, and the chromosome 2 locus MYH9/APOL1 was not fully analyzed due to limited genotyping.
The paper describes how they created mouse models of two viral infections associated with immunodeficiency, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and EB virus-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (EBV-HL). They took blood samples from patients with EBV or EBV-HL and transplanted them into immunodeficient mice called NOG. They found that EBV-infected T and NK cells could engraft into the mice, but only those from the CD4+ subset required CD4+ cells to engraft. They also found that EBV-infected T cells required CD4+ cells for engraftment, while EBV-infected NK cells did not. The mice showed the same types of symptoms as the patients, including splenomegaly and high levels of cytokines in the blood. The study suggests that EBV-infected cells are not truly malignant in the early stages of the disease but rather require CD4+ cells to proliferate and maintain their infection. The results provide a model for testing potential treatments for the diseases.
This paper analyzed the genetic diversity of the Opa proteins found in meningocococcal bacteria, which are responsible for adhesion and invasion of human nasopharyngeal epithelial cells. The Opa proteins are encoded by four genes and are highly diverse, with most of the variation found in three surface exposed loops. The authors found that the Opa repertoire of asymptomatic carriers of meningocococci was similar to that of invasive disease isolates, with similar combinations of Opa proteins found in different isolates. They also found that within individual Opa proteins, the diversity was low, indicating that immune selection has shaped the Opa repertoire. The authors propose that the Opa repertoire plays a role in immune evasion, and that different numbers of Opa loci are expressed in vivo, allowing the bacteria to evade immune responses. However, the diversity within individual Opa repertoires is reduced due to immune selection, as more diverse combinations are less likely to encounter hosts with previous exposure to one or more of their epitopes. This reduction in diversity may be advantageous for invasion of new populations with variable immune backgrounds. The low diversity within the Opa repertoire of the ST-1 clonal complex may be due to its recent entry into the Czech population, allowing it to spread quickly and gain transmission advantage.
This paper describes how Candida albicans, a common fungal pathogen, attaches to surfaces. The researchers used a combination of mutant identification, gene expression profiling, and overexpression-rescue approaches to define a regulatory network that governs the adherence of Candida cells to surfaces. They found that 12 transcription factors govern the expression of over 25% of the Candida albicans cell surface genes, including genes involved in cell-substrate adherence and biofilm formation. They identified 37 cell surface genes that are coordinately regulated by the 12 transcription factors. Overexpression of the transcription factor Zap1 partially restored adherence defects in mutants, suggesting that Zap1 regulates cell-cell adherence. The researchers propose that one or more of the 37 cell surface genes may promote adherence. The study provides insights into how Candida albicans attaches to surfaces, which could help develop new therapeutic strategies to prevent infections associated with implanted medical devices.
This paper investigated the differences in clinical, radiological, and inflammatory features between neurocysticercosis (NCC) cysts located in the parenchyma (parenchymal) vs. those located in the subarachnoid space (subarnoid) vs. the ventricular system (ventricular). The researchers found that patients with cysts in the subarnoid space had older ages at diagnosis, more symptoms such as intracranial hypertension, and seizures, and more severe inflammatory responses, including higher CSF protein concentration and cellularity. In contrast, patients with cysts in the parenchyma had fewer symptoms and less inflammation. The researchers suggest that the differences in immune response between the two locations may play a role in the different clinical presentations, with the subarnoid cysts having more inflammation due to the wider space and less contact with brain tissue. The findings suggest that the location of the cysts determines the severity and clinical presentation of the disease, with parenchymal cysts being milder and ventricular cysts being more severe. The study highlights the importance of considering cyst location when diagnosing and treating NCC patients.
The paper investigated the genetic diversity and spread of the bacteria Yersinia pestis in Madagascar. Using a combination of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and multiple locus variable number variable tandem repeats (MLVA), they identified 262 isolates from 25 districts in Madagascar and analyzed their genetic diversity and geographic distribution. They found that Yersinia pestis is maintained in multiple genetically distinct subpopulations in Madagascar, with limited gene flow between subpopulations, likely due to the limited mobility of the primary host, the black rat. Long distance transfers of Yersinia pestis are likely human-mediated. The analysis suggests that the central highlands are the most active plague focus in Madagascar and that new subclades emerge and become established there, while subclades are transferred to other locations, sometimes becoming established. The exact geographic distribution of the subpopulations is likely changing over time, with some subclades going extinct or decreasing in frequency and new subclades emerging. The paper highlights the dynamic nature of the maintenance and spread of Yersinia pestis in Madagascar, which is dependent on the natural cycle between the black rat and its flea vectors as well as human activities.
The paper discusses how mosquitoes have evolved a mechanism to protect themselves from oxidative stress after consuming blood meals. When mosquitoes feed on blood, they activate antioxidant enzymes such as catalase to reduce hydrogen peroxide levels in their gut. This helps prevent oxidative stress and maintain homeostasis. The authors found that when they silenced the catalase gene in mosquitoes using RNA interference, they had reduced lifespan and oviposition after being exposed to hydrogen peroxide. However, this did not affect the mosquitoes' ability to be infected with the Dengue virus. However, it did reduce the number of infected midguts when infected with the Dengue virus, suggesting that the mosquitoes had an altered "midgut infection barrier" that prevented the virus from establishing itself in the gut. However, the same silencing did not affect the mosquitoes' ability to be infected with the Zika virus. The authors conclude that different flaviviruses have different mechanisms of infection in the mosquito gut, with the Dengue virus using a different "midgut infection barrier" than the Zika virus.
The paper describes how chromatin remodeling proteins, which are responsible for repositioning nucleosomes along DNA, work at a molecular level. The authors used molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the mechanism by which chromatin remodeling proteins like Snf2 position nucleosomes along DNA. They found that the inchworm mechanism of the translocase domain, which slides along DNA by one base pair, is responsible for repositioning nucleosomes. This sliding is mediated by electrostatic interactions and the formation of twist defects along the nucleosome, which allow the translocase to swing towards the dyad. The translocase motion is coupled to the sliding of nucleosomal DNA, and the steric repulsion between the translocase and histone octamer prevents sliding in the opposite direction. The authors also showed that changes in DNA sequence can be exploited to control the kinetics of the system by affecting the formation of twist defects. They found that the twist defects play a key role in mediating the active repositioning mechanism and that the interaction between the basic patch on the translocase and the DNA gyre around SHL -6 is essential for sliding. The results provide a mechanistic understanding of the role of electrostatic interactions and nucleosome twist defects in repositioning and suggest a molecular mechanism by which DNA sequence can be exploited to control the activity of chromatin remodeling proteins.
The paper investigates the distribution of mammarenaviruses, a group of viruses that cause hemorrhagic fever, in Yunnan Province, China. Researchers collected small mammals in 12 counties and tested for mammarenavirus RNA. They found that Wenzhou mammarenavirus (WENV) was present in three rodent species and one tree shrew species, with the highest prevalence in brown rats and oriental house rats. The viruses were found in the liver, but also in other organs like the spleen, lung, kidney, and intestine. This suggests that some strains may have a wider tissue tropism and increase the risk of spillover to humans. The researchers also sequenced five full length genomes of WENV isolates and found that they are closely related to the known WENV strains, but there is diversity within the clade. The study demonstrates that WENV is present in three regions of Yunnan Province and highlights the importance of continued surveillance of mammarenavirus in both their natural reservoirs and in humans to reduce the risk of spillover and misdiagnosis of diseases.
This paper investigates the role of epigenetic mechanisms in determining the sex of mammalian gonads (testes and ovaries) during fetal development. The authors show that key genes that are involved in sex determination, called sex-determining genes, are initially bivalent, meaning they have both histone marks H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 at their promoters. This bivalent state allows them to be poised for either activation or repression. After sex determination, the sex-determining genes that become testis-specific lose the H3K27me3 mark while those that become ovary-specific retain the H3K27me3 mark. The authors propose that the bivalent state is maintained by the Polycomb group of proteins (PcG) and that the Polycomb subunit CBX2 in particular is required to repress the ovary pathway and stabilize the testis fate. Loss of CBX2 leads to XY sex reversal, indicating that it is required for sex determination. They also show that the Wnt signaling pathway is a primary target of PcG repression in testes. The findings suggest that the bivalent state of sex-determining genes is important for maintaining plasticity and enabling transdifferentiation long after the initial sex commitment.
The paper describes the discovery of a protein called DUET that is essential for male meiosis in plants. It is a PHD finger protein that binds histone H3K4me2 and is required for proper gene expression during meiosis. The authors identified two genes that depend on DUET for their expression: TDM1, which is required for cell cycle transitions during meiosis II, and JAS, which is required for spindle organization. They found that DUET expression peaks at the diplotene stage of meiosis and is required for the expression of TDM1. They also identified other genes that are downregulated in the absence of DUET, suggesting that DUET regulates the expression of many genes during meiosis. They showed that DUET binds the TDM1 promoter and is required for TDM1 expression. The loss of DUET expression results in defects during meiosis, including cytoplasmic collapse and the formation of dyads and triads. The results suggest that DUET functions as a transcriptional regulator during male meiosis, likely controlling the expression of many genes. The discovery of DUET and its function sheds light on the poorly understood mechanisms of meiotic gene expression in plants.
The study aimed to investigate the immune response to Leishmania braziliensis infection in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and how it relates to the development of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL). The researchers found that PBMCs from healthy individuals either produced high or low levels of interferon gamma (IFNγ) in response to Leishmania stimulation, which they divided into "high producers" (HPs) and "low producers" (LPs). They then analyzed the genes that were differentially expressed in the two groups in vitro. They found that HPs expressed genes associated with an inflammatory response, such as interferon stimulated genes, while LPs expressed genes associated with pattern recognition receptors and interferon signaling. They hypothesized that the in vivo equivalent of HPs would be individuals with subclinical infection, or SC individuals, who do not have lesions and lower IFNγ and TNF production upon stimulation. PBMCs from CL patients were then stimulated with Leishmania and the same genes were analyzed, and found to be differentially expressed in both. This suggests that the immune response in vitro is a good indicator of the immune response in vivo and could potentially lead to the identification of markers of CL development.
The paper discusses how the microtubules within a cell's cytokinetic spindle apparatus can play dual roles in inducing the contractile ring that constricts the cell during cell division. They propose a model that microtubules can either relax the cortex at the poles or stimulate the equatorial cortex, depending on their configuration and location within the cell. The dynamic astral microtubules relax the cortex by driving actin filaments towards the equator, while the stable central spindle microtubules stimulate the cortex by delivering actin aggregates. The stable microtubules can also relax the cortex by relocating cortical actin filaments. The two mechanisms work together to ensure that all available actin resources are redistributed to the equator for contractile ring assembly, providing redundancy and ensuring fidelity of cell division. The authors demonstrate this through experiments on silkworm spermatocytes, showing that cortical actin filaments can be redistributed via two microtubule-dependent pathways: relaxation at the poles and stimulation at the equator. The work provides insights into how the spindle and contractile ring assembly mechanisms work together to ensure proper cell division.
The paper discusses trends in dementia incidence rates in the Netherlands based on data from general practitioner networks that cover nearly all inhabitants of the country. The study found that between 1992 and 2014, dementia incidence rates increased by 2.1% per year, with higher rates among women and no significant change since a national dementia care program was launched in 2003. While some population-based studies have reported declining dementia incidence rates, this study found a small absolute increase in dementia incidence rates over the last two decades. The study suggests that while dementia incidence rates may be stabilizing, the absolute capacity required for caring for dementia patients in general practice is still likely to double every 20 years due to the growing older population. The findings highlight the need for further research to understand the complex trends in dementia incidence and their impact on dementia care.
The paper discusses the role of a protein called 2B4 in controlling the function of CD8+ T cells, specifically in chronic hepatitis C infections. The researchers found that 2B4 is expressed on a high percentage of CD8+ T cells in patients with chronic hepatitis C, but not as much on CD8+ T cells in healthy individuals. They found that 2B4 expression on CD8+ T cells can either enhance or inhibit their function, depending on the level of expression and the intracellular adaptor molecules involved. They showed that 2B4 cross-linking can stimulate CD8+ T cell proliferation, degranulation and cytokine production, while 2B4 blockade can enhance effector functions of exhausted CD8+ T cells. However, the response to 2B4 cross-linking varied between individuals and was linked to the level of 2B4 expression. They suggest that 2B4 could be both a marker of CD8+ T cell dysfunction and a potential target for immunotherapy, as it seems to play a role in controlling CD8+ T cell function during chronic viral infections.
The paper discusses how some viruses called poxviruses, like smallpox, can only infect certain animal species and not others. Researchers found that a gene called SAMD9L, found in many animal species, acts as a barrier that restricts the ability of poxviruses to infect certain species. They studied how SAMD9L works in mouse and human cells. They found that mouse SAMD9L functions similarly to human SAMD9 as a restriction factor, meaning that mouse SAMD9L restricts poxvirus replication. This suggests that the gene has been conserved in mammals to provide a barrier against poxvirus infections. They also found that some poxviruses have a different SAMD9L gene that restricts the same poxvirus, but with reduced potency. This suggests that poxviruses may have evolved to only restrict certain species. The mouse studies showed that mouse SAMD9L is essential for restricting poxvirus replication, while human SAMD9L is only partially effective. This suggests that having two different SAMD9L genes allows mammals to more easily adapt to new poxvirus infections. This study shows that having multiple SAMD9L genes in mammals provides a barrier against poxviruses that can help prevent cross-species transmission.
The paper describes the first comprehensive analysis of the epigenetic "methylome" of two mycoplasma species, Mycoplasma genitalium and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Using a technique called single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing, they were able to detect and analyze the methylation patterns of these bacteria at the single-base and single-strand resolution. They found that both species share an adenine methyltransferase that targets the sequence 5'-CT-3', but Mycoplasma pneumoniae additionally has a Type I methyltransferase that targets the sequence 5'-GAN7-3'/3'N7ATR-5'. The two methylation patterns correspond to over 999% of the sites directly detected by SMRT sequencing. They also found that the 5'-CT-3' methylation is enriched at the putative origin of replication and at regions associated with defense mechanisms and membrane proteins, suggesting that methylation may play a role in regulating DNA replication and gene expression. They identified unmethylated regions that could be protected by a protein, indicating a potential role in transcription. The analysis showed that methylation is not synchronized across the bacterial population, so different regions may have different functions. The study demonstrates the capability of SMRT sequencing to directly sequence and analyze the epigenetic profiles of a whole microbial genome at a single-base resolution, allowing for new insights into the role of epigenomics in prokaryotes.
The paper discusses how the structure of flaviviruses, a group of viruses that includes dengue, yellow fever, Zika, and West Nile, affects how they are neutralized by antibodies. The researchers found that a single amino acid change in the protein E of these viruses can make them more sensitive to neutralization by certain antibodies, even though the viruses are not fully mature. This sensitivity is not due to increased retention of uncleaved prM proteins, but rather a change in the conformational dynamics of the virus. The virus particles. The viruses with this change in E protein are less stable and decay more quickly, which may make them less infectious. The researchers also found that the effect of this amino acid change on viral neutralization sensitivity and stability was seen in mice infection, where it attenuated the virus infection. The study suggests that conformational dynamics of the virus may be an important factor in vivo that can be exploited for vaccine design.
The paper describes the development of a protein microarray to detect antibodies against Burkholderia pseudomallei, the bacteria that causes melioidosis. The microarray contains 20 proteins identified by previous studies as having the potential to elicit antibody responses in melioidosis patients. The authors tested the microarray with sera from patients at different times after infection, up to 52 weeks after admission, and found that different antigens elicit different types of antibody responses. Some antigens showed a strong, consistent response over time, while others showed a weaker response. The study showed that the protein microarray was more sensitive than the standard IHA test in detecting melioidosis upon admission and had a higher specificity. The results suggest that different antigens may be useful for detecting different types of past infections, with some inducing long-term responses and others inducing shorter-term responses. The protein microarray technology has the potential to improve diagnostics for melioidosis, but more studies are needed to validate its sensitivity and specificity in different settings.
The paper proposes a multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) scheme for Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasitic protozoan that causes Chagas disease. The authors evaluate different combinations of 13 and 7 genetic loci from two recently proposed MLST schemes to identify the optimal combination for typing T. cruzi isolates. They find that a 7-locus scheme provides the highest level of discriminatory power and is able to differentiate between the 25 reference isolates, while a 4-locus scheme is sufficient for lineage assignment. The authors also discuss the potential for heterozygosity complicating typing and suggest using single-copy genes to avoid comparing paralogous genes. They propose that the 7-locus MLST scheme could serve as a gold standard for T. cruzi typing, while the 4-locus scheme could be used for population genetics studies at a larger scale. The results show that MLST is a powerful approach for identifying genetic diversity and lineage relationships in T. cruzi.
The paper discusses research on silencing the gene called Dsx in female mosquitoes to study its role in controlling sexual dimorphism and disease transmission. The researchers found that silencing Dsx in female mosquitoes during development resulted in smaller wings, elongated proboscises, shorter antennae and maxillary palps, reduced fertility and fecundity, and a shorter lifespan. They suggest that Dsx may regulate growth and reproduction in both male and female mosquitoes, and that targeting Dsx during development could be a useful strategy for controlling disease transmission by reducing the lifespan of female mosquitoes which are responsible for transmitting diseases.
The paper describes a study on how a certain insect, the brown planthopper, L. striatellus, transmits several viruses that cause diseases in plants and animals. The researchers found that an insect sugar transporter protein, LsST6, plays a key role in allowing these viruses to enter the insect's midgut epithelial cells. LsST6 interacts with the viral protein that the insect is transmitting, and allows the virus to enter the insect's cells. When the expression of LsST6 was reduced in the insects, the viral transmission rate decreased, showing that LsST6 is essential for the virus to enter the insect's midgut cells. The researchers propose a model that the virus first binds to the midgut epithelial cells and then interacts with LsST6 on the cell membrane, allowing it to enter the cells and eventually spread throughout the insect's body. This model could be applied to other viruses transmitted by L. striatellus. The study provides evidence that LsST6 is a key target for controlling virus transmission by this insect.
The paper describes an experiment that tested the efficacy of a rabbit polyclonal antibody against leptospirosis in hamsters. The researchers found that the antibody improved survival in a dose-dependent manner when used to treat homologous leptospirosis, with the highest dose group surviving 100%. However, it did not provide complete protection against heterologous serotype leptospirosis. The antibody reduced pathological injury in the kidneys, liver and lung and almost completely removed leptospires from these organs in the hamsters. The results suggest that the antibody may be a new option for treating leptospirosis, but more research is needed to determine its efficacy in humans. The antibody was purified from rabbits immunized with a homologous leptospira serotype and then tested against both homologous and heterologous serotypes in hamster models. The researchers conclude that the antibody has potential as a treatment for leptospirosis, but additional clinical studies are needed to confirm its efficacy.
The paper describes a new method to identify genetic variations in Mycobacterium ulcerans, a bacterium that causes Buruli ulcer, a chronic skin and subcutaneous tissue disease in West Africa. The authors used a technique called single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) typing to identify 74 genetic variations in 74 patient isolates from the Densu river basin in Ghana. They found 5 genetic haplotypes among the isolates, with the most common haplotype found in many patients. They also identified 10 different haplotypes in a smaller sample of isolates from the same area. They found that some haplotypes were only found in certain parts of the basin, suggesting that transmission occurred through focal clusters rather than the entire area. They suggest that their results indicate that M. ulcerans has adapted to an aquatic environment and that environmental reservoirs like insects and water may play a role in transmission, rather than direct person-to-person contact. The study provides the first genetic markers for studying transmission and reservoirs of M. ulcerans in the Densu river basin and could help guide future research on how the disease spreads.
The paper discusses how the Schizosaccharomyces japonicus species of fission yeast, which can switch between yeast and hypha forms in response to environmental cues, uses a mechanism of Quorum Sensing (QS) to regulate this dimorphism. The authors found that the QS mechanism is mediated by aromatic alcohols such as phenylethanol, tyrosol and tryptol, which accumulate in the medium during stationary phase and limit hyphal growth at high cell densities. The SAPK signaling pathway, which is a key player in the regulation of cellular responses to environmental cues in the Schizoscharomyces pombe species, is also involved in this QS mechanism. The SAPK pathway negatively regulates hyphal differentiation in Schizoscharomyces japonicus, with the MAPK Sty1 controlling expression of the transcription factor Atf1. Nrg1, an activator of hyphal differentiation in Candida albicans, is repressed in Schizoscharomyces japonicus by the SAPK pathway. The study shows that the SAPK pathway plays a constitutive role in regulating the dimorphism, with QS also contributing to this process. The results demonstrate that Schizoscharomyces japonicus is a suitable model organism to study the intricate mechanisms regulating cellular differentiation in fungi and provide insights into the evolutionary conservation of cellular processes.
The paper investigates how viral infections like influenza and HIV increase pain sensitivity in mice. It finds that inflammatory responses outside the central nervous system, specifically in the lungs and lymphoid tissues, increase an enzyme called interferon-induced by the interferon-one (IDO) which then increases pain sensitivity. The researchers show that splenic dendritic cells that express IDO are responsible for this increase in pain sensitivity. They also find that interactions between splenic IDO-expressing cells and CD4 T cells are required to activate these cells and induce the pain sensitivity. The increase in IDO activity is not necessary for the viruses to establish themselves in the body but is sufficient to cause increased pain sensitivity. The mechanism by which IDO increases pain sensitivity is not fully understood but the researchers suggest that IDO metabolizes tryptophan into neuroactive compounds that activate pain receptors.
The paper discusses how Trypanosoma cruzi, the agent of Chagas disease, can maintain its infectivity and virulence by secreting extracellular nucleotides like ATP and ADP. The authors show that high levels of extracellular ATPase activity are required for the parasite to infect cells and that this activity decreases as the parasites mature and complete their life cycle. They demonstrate that inhibition of extracellular ATPase activity using drugs like Suramin, Gadolinium and ARL6156 leads to a decrease in infectivity and virulence. They also show that inhibition of extracellular ATPase activity inhibits the parasite's ability to infect cells. They propose that inhibition of extracellular ATPase activity may be an effective new approach to treat Chagas disease. The paper also describes the first biochemical characterization of recombinant T. cruzi extracellular nucleotase and shows that antibodies to the extracellular nucleotase can block parasite infection.
The paper describes a new approach called NFP for analyzing the neutralizing antibody responses of HIV-1 infected individuals. The current approach, called next-generation NFP, addresses several challenges in the original NFP method. The new methods include simulating HIV-1 neutralization by pairwise monoclonal antibody combinations to generate large amounts of data that can be used for training and testing algorithms, predicting the existence of potentially novel antibody specificities in a given serum, estimating the confidence in the predictions, and selecting virus panels for neutralization experiments that improve the accuracy. The authors applied the next-generation NFP algorithms to a large collection of HIV-infected donor plasma samples and found that they could accurately predict the overall prevalence of different antibody specificities in the samples. The approach has the potential to provide valuable insights into the interactions between the virus and immune system, guide vaccine design and improve the development of epitope-specific HIV-1 vaccines.
The paper describes a study on how certain mice that are able to shed large amounts of Salmonella bacteria in their feces are able to maintain a healthy immune system. They found that these "super-shedders" have high levels of neutrophils and low levels of CD4 T cells in their spleen, which allows them to tolerate the inflammation caused by the bacteria. This is in contrast to "moderate-shedders" that shed less amounts of bacteria and have more CD4 T cells in their spleen. They propose that the neutrophils are necessary to control the bacterial load in the spleen and that the low CD4 T cell levels in the spleen are part of the mechanism that allows super-shedders to tolerate the inflammation. They also found that treatment with granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was able to recapitulate the immune response of super-shedders, including low CD4 T cell levels and high levels of neutrophils in the spleen, suggesting that neutrophils are the key factor. They propose that this mechanism could be used to manage disease in people that shed Salmonella.
The paper describes a mouse model of Lafora disease, a rare genetic disorder that causes epilepsy, myoclonus and dementia in humans. The disease is caused by mutations in genes that encode a carbohydrate-binding enzyme and ubiquitin ligase. The mice model shows that removing a protein called protein targeting phosphatase (P) that interacts with the enzyme glycogen synthase (GS) and glycogen branching enzyme (GB) reduces the formation of large glycogen structures called Lafora bodies (LB) and the progressive neurodegeneration associated with the disease. The reduction of LB in the mice leads to a complete disappearance of the polyglucans that form in neuronal processes and a correction of the myoclonus and epilepsy. The study suggests that the neurodegeneration in the disease is caused by the disturbance in glycogen metabolism, specifically the accumulation of glycogen, rather than protein aggregation. The findings suggest that targeting the interaction between PTG and the enzymes could be a potential therapeutic approach for the disease.
The study looked at how well antibody tests and clinical examinations can detect trachoma in a region where trachoma is still present, after 3 years of mass antibiotic treatment. The study found that antibody tests were able to detect trachoma, especially in children over 5 years old, and that antibody levels increased with age. However, clinical examination of trachoma (TF and TI) did not show a good correlation with antibody levels. The researchers suggest that antibody tests provide a more objective and long-term measure of exposure to trachoma, rather than just the current infection status. They argue that antibody tests could be used as a supplement or replacement to clinical grading of TF for monitoring trachoma elimination efforts, especially in areas where infection rates are low. The study suggests that antibody tests may be useful in evaluating whether trachoma elimination efforts have been successful, even if infection rates have not fully decreased.
The paper discusses how structural biology in the post-genome era faces the challenge of determining function from 3D structure data, which is the next step towards realizing the promises of genomics. Many proteins have unknown function and structural similarity does not necessarily imply functional similarity. The authors propose a computational method called THEMATICS to predict important residues involved in catalysis and substrate binding in protein structures. They use THEMATICS to sort structurally similar proteins into functional classes based on their predicted active sites and spatial arrangements. They analyze a family of structurally similar DJ-1 superfamily proteins with unknown function and find that THEMATICS predictions enable the proteins to be sorted into at least three distinct functional categories based on their predicted active site residues. While the proteins share similar primary, secondary, and tertiary structures, the three predicted functional classes have different quaternary structures and predicted active site motifs. The THEMICS predictions for the known structures of the DJ-1 family members support the conclusion that they belong to at least three different functional classes based on phylogenetic analysis. The authors discuss how THEMATICS can also be used to annotate unknown function proteins whose structures are not known. The method provides important clues for determining function and is time-saving for function determination.
The paper describes how a virus called Rice stripe virus (RSV) manipulates the production of microRNAs (miRNAs) in rice plants to promote its own infection. RSV causes the accumulation of certain miRNAs, including miR168, miR39, miR395, and miR39, which can suppress the plant's antiviral response. The authors found that the RSV encoded protein NS3 is responsible for this miRNA accumulation, by interacting with a protein called DRB1 in the RNA-induced silencing complex. NS3 interacts with DRB1 at a specific site that is required for DRB1 homodimerization, and this interaction helps NS3 to recruit pri-miRNAs for mature miRNA processing. Overexpression of NS3 in rice plants leads to increased accumulation of miRNAs and enhances RSV pathogenicity, while inhibition of NS3 leads to reduced RSV pathogenicity. The study shows that NS3 acts as a key factor in the RNA-induced silencing pathway by recruiting pri-miRNAs and promoting miRNA processing, which helps RSV to infect rice plants more efficiently. The findings provide insights into how viruses manipulate the host's RNA metabolism to promote their own infection and may lead to new strategies for breeding RSV-resistant rice.
This paper investigates the difference in how naive and memory T cells respond to a viral infection in mice. The researchers found that both naive and memory T cells show a delay of about 2-3 days before they begin to divide after infection, which is seen in both lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues. This delay occurs despite the fact that antigen levels reach levels that can stimulate T cell proliferation within 2-3 days of infection. The researchers suggest that this lag phase may be due to negative regulation of T cells by host factors, such as cellular restraints or cytokines produced by regulatory T cells. The memory T cells then rapidly accumulate and outstrip the naive T cells in most tissues, but the memory cells also have better survival and are less prone to apoptosis, which may contribute to their more rapid expansion. The authors propose that the delay in T cell division may allow the innate immune response to control the infection initially, before the adaptive immune response begins. The paper concludes that the delay in cell division may represent a mechanism to reduce the risk of unwanted immune responses.
The paper discusses how fever, or hyperthermia, can stimulate the replication of HIV. The authors found that elevating the temperature of the cells to 39.5°C, similar to a fever, can increase the replication of HIV in primary CD4+ T cells and cell lines. They showed that hyperthermia increases the levels of Hsp90 protein, which is involved in regulating HIV transcription. This increased HIV transcription at 39.5°C, particularly the LTR promoter, which is activated by Tat. Hyperthermia also enhanced viral entry and fusion. However, reverse transcription remained unchanged at 39.5°C. The authors propose that Hsp90 likely plays a role in facilitating HIV transcription at this temperature by binding more efficiently to the P-TEFb/Tat/TAR complex, which enhances chromatin modeling and accessibility to the LTR. They suggest that fever may directly stimulate HIV replication or reactivation from latent reservoirs, possibly in association with other immune responses.
The paper discusses the potential of traditional Indian medicinal plants as a source of new anti-leishmanial drugs. The authors investigate the efficacy of two traditional Indian medicinal plants, Artemisia annua and Artemisia absinthium, against visceral leishmaniasis in mice. They find that treatment with Artemisia annua leaves and seeds at doses of 20-50mg/kg body weight per day for 10 days significantly reduces parasite burden in the liver and spleen, and induces a Th1 response characterized by increased interferon gamma production and decreased IL-4 and IL-10 levels. This results in an increase in CD4+ and CD8+ T cell numbers and lymphocyte proliferation, indicating that the treatment is effective in shifting the immune response towards a Th1-biased response. The authors suggest that these plants may be useful as alternative drugs for the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis, which is more severe and resistant to current chemotherapy, since they have shown to be non-toxic in mice.
The paper discusses a protein called RipA, which is essential for cell division in the bacteria Mycobacterium smegmatis, but not in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. RipA is involved in breaking crosslinks in the cell wall, which is important for cell division. The paper shows that RipA is required for normal cell division and growth in Mycobacterium smegmatis, but not in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, where multiple copies of the gene are needed for growth. The paper also shows that RipA interacts with a protein called RpfB, which enhances its activity. The interaction between RipA and RpfB likely occurs during cell division and enhances RipA's ability to break crosslinks, making RipA a potential target for antibiotics that target the cell wall. The study suggests that RipA represents a vulnerability for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, making it an attractive target for antimycobacterial drugs.
The paper describes a new method called "Diffusion Approximations for Demographic Inference" that can efficiently simulate and analyze the joint allele frequency spectrum of multiple populations. This allows for more accurate demographic inference by accounting for linkage and linkage disequilibrium, which is difficult to do with traditional methods. The authors applied the method to study the history of humans, inferring parameters like population growth rates, bottlenecks, migration rates, and divergence times. They found that their methods provided a good fit to the observed allele frequency spectrum and made predictions consistent with previous studies, but also raised some interesting questions about the timing and extent of these events. The diffusion approach was found to be more efficient than traditional coalescent simulations, allowing for extensive bootstrap resampling and goodness-of-fit tests, which helped to estimate parameter uncertainties and account for linkage. The authors hope that their methods will be useful for studying population genetics in other species.
This paper investigated the genetic basis of eyebrow thickness in humans, which has been found to vary between populations. The authors conducted genome-wide association studies in East Asians, Europeans, and Latin Americans and found three novel genetic variants associated with eyebrow thickness. They then used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to experimentally validate the effect of these variants on nearby genes. They found that variants at rs13541 and rs1251896 affect the expression of SOX2 and FOXD1, respectively, which in turn affect eyebrow thickness. The variants were found to be associated with different allele frequencies among populations, suggesting population heterogeneity in the genetics of eyebrow thickness. However, the authors found no evidence of strong positive selection associated with the variants. The results suggest that eyebrow thickness may not be under strong genetic selection, but instead is a neutral feature. The study provides evidence that genetic variants near SOX2 and FOXD1 affect eyebrow thickness and demonstrates how genome-wide association studies and CRISPR/Cas9 can be used together to study the functional effects of non-coding genetic variants.
The paper discusses how the drug sensitivity of Trichuris suis and Oesophagum dentatum, two species of parasitic nematodes that inhabit the same part of the intestine, differs when exposed to anthelmintic drugs. The researchers found that Trichuris suis was less affected by high concentrations of the drugs, indicating that it has a lower drug uptake and/metabolism compared to Oesophagum dentatum. This was shown through motility assays, drug uptake measurements, and metabolite concentrations within the worms. They suggest that the difference in drug uptake may be due to structural differences in the cuticle or lipid contents of the two species. The results suggest that Trichuris suis may have a lower drug uptake mechanism, which could explain its lower sensitivity to anthelmintic drugs in vitro and in vivo. The findings provide a new perspective on why Trichuris suis is often less effectively treated with single-dose anthelmintic drugs, and may help guide future research into improving drug treatments for Trichuris suis infections.
The paper discusses how the bacteria Haemophilus influenzae, a common cause of otitis media, adapts to the human nasopharynx by developing biofilms. When exposed to an iron-restricted environment, Haemophilus develops taller, mushroom-shaped towers in its biofilms, which are more resistant to antibiotics and inflammation. The bacteria also shows increased invasion of host epithelial cells. The authors propose that this adaptation, mediated by a regulatory mechanism involving the gene sulA, provides a mechanism for Haemophilus to persist in the face of host immune pressure. They demonstrate that prior heme-iron restriction leads to enhanced persistence, invasion, and biofilm development. The results suggest that immune pressure and host microenvironments play a role in shaping the developmental programs of bacteria, allowing them to better persist in disease.
The paper describes the construction and release of an ontology called IDODEN for the dengue fever disease. An ontology is a formal, explicit specification of a conceptualization and common vocabulary describing classes, attributes, and relations in a domain. The IDODEN ontology was constructed using the Web Ontology Language (OWL) and the Bio-Ontology Format (BFO) to provide a standardized framework for describing dengue-related knowledge. It contains 5035 terms and 1482 imported terms from other ontologies. The ontology is organized into different classes to provide a hierarchical structure for describing dengue-related concepts, such as dengue fever, dengue host, dengue virus, and mosquito vector. The ontology can be used to model complex processes and outcomes of dengue infection, as well as to annotate data in specialized databases for research and decision support systems. The authors hope that the ontology will be useful for researchers and medical personnel in enabling efficient searches and comparisons of data and knowledge. The ontology can also serve as a foundation for future vaccine development. The authors emphasize that the ontology can be adapted to accommodate new developments and will be valuable if widely adopted by the dengue research community.
