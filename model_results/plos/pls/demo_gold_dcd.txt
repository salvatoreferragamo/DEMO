Genetic and epigenetic alterations are key drivers of tumour formation and progression. Epigenetic changes occur in the form of DNA methylation, which is the most common epigenetic alteration in tumours, and is known to be associated with the loss of tumour suppressor genes. Here, we investigate the epigenetic landscape of intestinal adenomas, which are early tumours that arise in response to loss of the tumour suppressor APC. We find that the epigenetic signature of intestinal adenomas is recurring and conserved between mouse and human tumours, and that it can be used as a biomarker for early detection of colon cancer.
Over 13 million people are estimated to be infected with Chagas disease in Latin America. The disease has a wide range of clinical forms, from mild to fatal. The disease is caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. The parasite is transmitted by the bite of an infected bloodsucking insect. Once inside the body, the parasite multiplies and causes inflammation, which leads to tissue damage. Chagas disease is endemic to Latin America and is often asymptomatic, but the disease can progress to more severe forms, such as heart disease. The disease is usually treated with antiparasitic drugs, but there is currently no vaccine available to prevent the disease. It is important to understand the mechanisms of the disease in order to develop a vaccine. In this study, the researchers analyzed the immune response of human blood cells upon infection with two strains of T. cruzi, the Y strain and the Col cl1.7 strain. The results showed that the two strains lead to different immune responses, which might be associated with different disease outcomes. The data suggests that the parasite strain plays a role in the development of the host response early in infection, which may affect the clinical progression of Chagas disease.
DNA polymerases are enzymes that copy DNA sequences. In mammalian cells, three DNA polymerases are known to copy DNA: pol θ, pol δ, and pol ν. Pol ν is the least well understood of these three polymerases. It is present in many animals, including humans, but it is not known what role it plays in the cells of mammals. The DNA sequence of humans and other mammals contains a gene that encodes a DNA polymerase called pol ν. However, pol ν is not known to be involved in DNA repair, DNA recombination, or DNA damage tolerance. To investigate the role of pol ν in mammalian cells, we created mice that had a disrupted version of the pol ν gene. The mice were viable and fertile, but had no obvious abnormalities. We also created cells from mice that were genetically disrupted for the pol ν gene. These cells had a normal response to DNA crosslinking agents, which are chemicals that damage DNA. This suggests that pol ν does not play a role in DNA repair or DNA damage tolerance. These findings are in contrast to earlier studies that suggested that pol ν is involved in DNA repair. We conclude that pol ν is a DNA polymerase that is involved in DNA recombination in mammalian cells.
Vaccines are considered a cost-effective way to control infectious diseases. Vaccine candidates are selected based on their potential to trigger appropriate immune responses against a specific pathogen. The dengue virus is a significant threat to public health. A dengue vaccine candidate is needed urgently. The dengue virus envelope protein domain III (ED III) was selected as a candidate for a dengue vaccine. We expressed ED III as a recombinant protein in an Escherichia coli-based system. We demonstrated that the recombinant lipidated ED III (LD2ED III) was more immunogenic than recombinant ED III. The immunogenicity of LD2ED III was evaluated in animal models. LD2ED III was found to be more immunogenic than recombinant ED III. The antibody avidity and neutralizing capacity of the antibodies induced by LD2ED III were higher than those elicited by recombinant ED III or dengue-2 virus. The results of the current study suggest that LD2ED III is a safe vaccine candidate for inducing long-lasting neutralizing antibody responses with a low risk of detrimental effects.
Cells respond to extracellular factors, such as hormones or growth factors, by activating intracellular signaling pathways. The response of a cell to a given stimulus can vary strongly between individual cells, a phenomenon known as cell-to-cell variability. This variability can lead to different cellular responses to the same stimulus, which may be advantageous or deleterious depending on the biological system. In this work, we systematically analyze the cell-to-cell variability of intracellular signaling pathways, and identify the main factors that restrict the biological outcome of cells responding to extracellular factors. We show that cell-to-cell variability can be actively modulated by parameter tuning, gene expression noise regulation or additional signaling mechanisms such as feedforward and feedback loops.
Visceral leishmaniasis is a chronic disease caused by the protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani. CD8+ T cells are essential for protecting against visceral leishmaniasis. However, CD8+ T cells are not able to effectively control infection with L. donovani. This is due to the fact that L. donovani has evolved mechanisms to evade the immune response and to cause chronic inflammation in the spleen, where the parasite resides. The study of CD8+ T cell responses in L. donovani infection has been hindered by the lack of knowledge of CD8+ T cell epitopes. Here, the authors show that L. donovani infection induces a biphasic CD8+ T cell response, with the first wave resulting in limited expansion and the second wave leading to cell death and functional exhaustion of CD8+ T cells. The authors also show that blocking an inhibitory pathway, B7-H1/PD-1, during chronic L. donovani infection rescues CD8+ T cell responses and reduces the parasite burden. These results have important implications for the development of therapeutic vaccines aimed at inducing protective CD8+ T cells.
Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are a group of diseases that include "mad cow" disease and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, characterized by abnormal folding of the prion protein (PrP). The misfolded PrP is implicated in the development of these diseases. The molecular mechanism underlying transmissible spongiform encephalopathies remains elusive. Here we report a microsecond molecular dynamics simulation study of the misfolding of mammalian PrP at acidic pH. Our simulations reveal that the protonation of a specific residue, H187, when the protein passes through acidic cell organelles, can destabilize PrP. This destabilization process can follow two alternative pathways, potentially resulting in different final structures. Our findings suggest that the different strains observed in prion diseases may be encoded in the structure of the misfolded PrP, and the alternative pathways of destabilization may contribute to this variation.
Trachoma causes visual impairment through in-turned eyelashes (trichiasis) on the surface of the eye. Epilation, intermittent plucking of lashes touching the eye, is a common traditional practice. The long-term effectiveness of epilation in preventing visual impairment is unknown. The study evaluated eyelid surgery as the main treatment option evaluated. 1300 people with mild trichiasis in Ethiopia were included in the trial. Epilation was the main treatment option evaluated. No difference was found between the epilation and surgery groups regarding change in vision and corneal opacity. Most participants in the epilation arm continued epilating to control their trichiasis. The study suggests that good quality epilation can be a reasonable second-line alternative to surgery for individuals who either decline surgery or do not have immediate access to it.
Dengue disease is a growing public health concern as it affects a large percentage of the world's population. Understanding dengue disease is important to comprehend the mechanisms of entry, infection biology, and pathogenesis of dengue disease. Macrophages (MØ) are thought to play an important role in disease both as primary targets of viral infection and as a source of immunomodulatory cytokines. The dengue virus (DV) interacts with macrophages, dendritic cells, hepatocytes, and endothelial cells. The dengue virus binds to a number of opsonic and non-opsonic receptors on cells of the mononuclear phagocyte lineage including DC-SIGN. The dengue virus mannose receptor (MR) is an important target for DV infection of macrophages. We show that MR binds to DV grown in mosquito cells and to recombinant mammalian cell–produced DV envelope glycoprotein. A recombinant MR fusion protein (CRD4–7-Fc) was shown to recognize DV envelope (E) protein in ELISA and blot overlays, and binding was inhibited by mannose, fucose and EDTA. The presence of MR on transfected cells is sufficient to confer DV binding. DV infection of MØ was blocked by antibodies against the human MR suggesting that it is a novel functional receptor contributing to DV infection.
Answer: The focus is to better understand the brain. Question: What aspect do most simulations based on the human structural connectome investigate? Answer: Most simulations investigate spontaneous neural dynamics in the absence of tasks, sensory input, or motor output. Question: In what way does this particular approach differ from typical simulations? Answer: This approach uses a computational model of spontaneous neural dynamics to control a simulated agent with sensory input from and motor output to a simulated environment. Question: What impact does embodying the model have on its operation and our understanding of its computational mechanisms? Answer: Embodying the model radically changes how the model operates and how we understand the computational mechanisms. Question: What interesting interactions do the authors observe when studying brain-environment feedback? Answer: The authors observe interesting brain-environment feedback interactions. Question: How does the presence of brain-environment feedback require compensation? Answer: The presence of brain-environment feedback requires different homeostatic systems to compensate for it. Question: Where do the authors observe the effects of brain-environment feedback and compensation? Answer: The effects are observed in both the simulated neural dynamics and the behavior of the embodied agent. Question: What do the findings of this study suggest about homeostatic systems? Answer: The findings suggest novel functional roles for homeostatic systems in maintaining neural dynamics and behavior. Question: Which network pattern of activity is poorly understood in functional neuroimaging studies? Answer: The default mode network pattern of activity is poorly understood. Question: In which organisms have default mode network patterns of activity been reported? Answer: Default mode network patterns of activity have been reported in both humans and animals in functional neuroimaging studies.
Gene expression in eukaryotic cells is regulated by a complex network of interactions between the chromosomes, transcription factors, and other regulatory proteins. However, the mechanisms by which gene expression is regulated over long distances in higher eukaryotic species are not well understood. In this study, we developed a new assay that can be used to screen for functional long-distance chromosomal interactions that affect gene expression. We used the assay to probe the expression of a specific gene, MET3pr, in a yeast genome-wide screen. The results indicate that long-distance chromosomal interactions can affect the average level and noise of gene expression. Furthermore, we found that MET3pr-GFP overexpression is specific to a subset of Met4-targeted genes, which tend to cluster in 3D space. These data suggest that long-distance clustering of co-regulated genes can enhance gene expression in yeast. This assay may be used as a general platform to screen for functional long-distance chromosomal interactions in higher eukaryotic species.
Meiosis is the process by which diploid precursor cells give rise to haploid gametes. During meiosis, homologous chromosomes segregate and exchange genetic material. This process is called meiosis I, and the resulting haploid gametes then undergo a second round of chromosome segregation during meiosis II. The specialized cell division called meiosis is essential for sexual reproduction in all organisms.
The innate immune system of plants relies on its ability to recognize and inhibit the entry of pathogens into the plant leaf interior. The innate immune response is triggered by recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). However, the precise mechanism of stomatal regulation during PAMP recognition remains unknown. Here, we report the identification and characterization of the Arabidopsis RIN4 protein complex. We were able to purify several associated proteins by immunoaffinity chromatography and identify them by mass spectrometry. We identified the PM H+-ATPases AHA1 (At2g18960) or AHA2 (At4g30190), whose interaction we characterized in greater detail. The C-terminal regulatory domain of AHA1 and AHA2 interact with RIN4 in planta using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC). RIN4 overexpression enhanced PM H+-ATPase activity, while the rin4 knockout could not re-open its stomata in response to virulent Pst. We also show that RIN4 is expressed in guard cells along with other PTI and ETI signaling components. Our findings are consistent with a model in which RIN4 associates with the C-terminal autoinhibitory domain of the PM H+-ATPase to regulate leaf stomata in response to PAMPs.
Larvicides are chemicals or biological substances that prevent mosquito larvae from hatching or developing into adult mosquitoes. The main purpose of using larvicides in public areas is to prevent the growth of mosquito populations and decrease the risks of mosquito-borne diseases outbreaks and nuisance from mosquito bites. In this study, the researchers used mosquito collection data from 10 municipalities in Northern Italy over two years with different temperature conditions to model the effect of larviciding on Aedes albopictus populations. The researchers evaluated the probabilities of potential outbreaks of chikungunya and dengue. Intervention costs were compared to the economic and health benefits due to the avoidance of clinical cases. The optimal timing for larviciding interventions is centered on the month of July, corresponding to the period of maximal growth of the mosquito population. In what types of towns are municipality-wide interventions likely to be cost-effective? For larger cities, a neighborhood-based intervention should be considered. Was involving citizens to apply larvicides within private premises effective? Generally, involving citizens was considered costly because of the associated expenses. In what geographic focus of the study on larviciding interventions? The study focused on municipalities in temperate areas in Europe, specifically in Northern Italy.
Obstacle avoidance is one of the most fundamental functions supported by bats. However, the cues used to avoid obstacles are still not known. In this paper, we propose the first computationally explicit explanation for obstacle avoidance in echolocating bats. We show that the sensorimotor system of bats can use the interaural intensity difference and the time delay of the first millisecond of the echo train to successfully avoid obstacles.
Metabolism is the set of chemical processes that occur within a living organism, and is responsible for transforming available resources into energy currency and building blocks in living organisms. In this paper, we explore the possibility that certain aspects of metabolism may have been optimized for efficiency. We first explore the properties of optimal metabolic pathways in an artificial chemistry, and then ask whether similar signatures of optimality can be observed in real metabolic networks. We find that metabolic pathways in the artificial chemistry recur in a modular fashion, and that the number of reactions used in these pathways is consistent with the number of steps predicted by an analytical approximation. Finally, we find that real metabolic pathways exhibit similar properties of optimality as the artificial chemistry.
Answer: The purpose is to infer migration rates and population sizes across space in recent time periods. Question: How does the method introduced in the text differ from the previously developed EEMS method? Answer: The method introduced in the text differs from EEMS in terms of the models used (coalescent vs resistance), the data used (haplotype vs average genetic distance), and the ability to separately estimate migration rates and population sizes. Question: What type of data does the novel method use? Answer: The novel method uses haplotype data. Question: How does the use of haplotype data benefit the novel method? Answer: The use of haplotype data allows the method to separately estimate migration rates and population sizes, and infer demography associated with different recent time periods. Question: What is the acronym given to the method introduced in the text? Answer: The method is called MAPS, which stands for "Migration And Population-size Surfaces." Question: How many individuals of European ancestry were analyzed in the application of MAPS to real data? Answer: 2224 individuals of European ancestry were analyzed. Question: What is the significance of the "Voronoi" prior in the method? Answer: The "Voronoi" prior is used to regularize parameters of the model. Question: How does the novel method calibrate the decay of haplotypes over time? Answer: The method uses a recombination rate map to calibrate the decay of haplotypes over time. Question: What are the two key differences between the novel method and EEMS? Answer: The two key differences are the models used (coalescent vs resistance) and the type of data used (haplotype vs average genetic distance).
Insulin resistance is a condition in which insulin is unable to trigger its normal physiological effects, such as promoting glucose uptake and storage. Insulin resistance is linked to the development of chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. In the liver, insulin regulates the balance between the growth and death of cells, and insulin resistance has been linked to the development of liver disease. However, the impact of insulin resistance on the liver's ability to repair itself after injury has not been well understood. The liver has a unique ability to regenerate itself, but this process is not well understood. We have found that in mice, the liver's ability to repair itself is reduced in mice that are genetically unable to produce insulin, which is a hallmark of insulin resistance. We also found that the liver's ability to repair itself was reduced in mice that were given a diet that contained a toxic chemical, which is known to cause liver damage. We found that the liver's ability to repair itself was also reduced in human liver cells that were treated with a chemical that inhibits the liver's ability to produce insulin. Together, these findings suggest that insulin resistance can impair the liver's ability to repair itself after injury. This could contribute to the development of liver disease in people with insulin resistance.
Sensory neurons are specialized cells that detect and transmit sensory information to the brain. They sample their environment through highly branched structures called dendritic arbors or trees. The precise patterning of dendritic arbors is important for the proper functioning of the nervous system. The unfolded protein response is a cellular process that ensures a functional protein-folding environment in the cell's endoplasmic reticulum. In the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans, the unfolded protein response is required for dendritic arbor development. The function of the unfolded protein response in dendrite patterning is evolutionarily conserved from C. elegans to mammals. Loss of the required enzyme can be bypassed by reducing signaling through the insulin-like growth factor receptor. The findings of this research suggest a new way of bypassing defects in the unfolded protein response during dendrite development.
NAD+ is a central player in energy conservation pathways, shuttling electrons from the oxidation of growth substrates to respiratory or fermentative pathways. Despite its importance, little is known about the mechanisms that regulate NAD+ levels and how these pathways are integrated to control energy conservation. To investigate these processes, we analyzed the role of the transcription factor ArcA in Escherichia coli. ArcA is a key regulator of anaerobic metabolism, repressing genes involved in aerobic respiration and preserving oxidized NAD+ for fermentation pathways. We show that ArcA binds to specific regions of DNA that are not conserved among other transcription factors. These binding sites contain additional sequence elements beyond what is required for DNA binding, which likely play a role in regulating transcriptional output. Our results reveal a novel mechanism for regulating NAD+ levels and suggest a novel function for ArcA in maintaining redox homeostasis.
Previous studies have shown that Rb+/− mice develop pituitary adenomas. The present study uncovered a novel genetic pathway that may lead to Rb downregulation through RNA splicing mediated by USP39. The forward genetic study in zebrafish suggested that the loss of USP39 results in aberrant rb1 mRNA splicing. Aberrant rb1 mRNA splicing likely causes elevated expression of its target gene E2F4, which is known to have oncogenic activity when overexpressed. The main factor responsible for adenohypophyseal cell lineage hyperplasia in the zebrafish USP39 mutant is the upregulation of E2F4.
Each year, approximately 2,000 infants in the United States develop brain damage due to intrauterine infection with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). In this study, we used a mouse model of HCMV infection to investigate the role of the immune response in the development of abnormalities in the structure of the cerebellum. We found that when newborn mice were treated with a glucocorticoid, a class of drugs commonly used to treat inflammation, the developmental abnormalities in the cerebellum were corrected. This suggested that inflammation may be responsible for the brain abnormalities that occur in infants who develop HCMV infection in the womb.
Diarrhea is the most common cause of death in developing countries. Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) are the most common cause of diarrheal disease in developing countries. ETEC are responsible for over 1.5 million deaths each year. Currently there is no vaccine available that would offer sustained, broad-based protection against ETEC. ETEC are genetically heterogeneous pathogens that share the ability to colonize the small intestine where they deliver the cholera toxin-like heat-labile toxin (LT) and/or small peptide heat-stable (ST) toxins that ultimately result in diarrhea. In the classic paradigm for ETEC pathogenesis, small intestinal colonization requires plasmid-encoded colonization factors (CFs). A variety of more than 25 antigenically distinct fimbrial, or fibrillar CFs have been described to date. However, CF antigens are not appreciably cross-protective, and many ETEC strains do not appear to produce CFs. Moreover, LT alone (or the homologous cholera toxin) do not appear to afford complete sustained protection. These constraints, as well as a growing appreciation of the complexity of ETEC pathogenesis, have prompted searches for additional surface-expressed antigens. Recently, we identified several conserved autotransporter proteins that are recognized during the course of experimental and natural ETEC infections. These data suggest that the passenger domains of these autotransporters are recognized during the course of both experimental infections in animals and naturally occurring infections in humans. These results validate recent immunoproteomic data obtained with the prototype H10407 ETEC strain using sera from infected mice or human convalescent sera. The surface expression of the autotransporter passenger domains, their immunogenicity, and preliminary data presented here support the concept that this class of molecules could serve as protective antigens.
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a viral disease that is transmitted by ticks. It is endemic in the Middle East and is a significant public health problem in Oman, where it is known to be associated with animal slaughtering and butchery.
Cells are robust against environmental changes, mutations, and noise in biochemical reactions. This robustness is a common design principle of biological systems. The robustness of a cellular system can be assessed by perturbation analysis of the extent to which each intracellular parameter can be changed without disrupting the function of the system. However, it is not easy to identify the molecular mechanism behind the robustness of biological systems. In this study, we used a previously developed genetic experiment designated “genetic tug-of-war” (gTOW) to measure the copy number limit of overexpression of certain target genes. We found that the robustness of a cellular system is related to the stoichiometry of its components, and that dosage imbalance causes fragility of cellular systems. Our study suggests that knowledge about cellular robustness can be effectively used to improve integrative mathematical models.
STAT6 is a key transcription factor that mediates the extracellular cytokine and virus-mediated immune response. Dysregulation of STAT6 is linked to the pathological features of virus-associated cancers. However, the molecular mechanism of STAT6 regulation by tumor viruses is still unknown. Here we reveal that the lytic activation of human herpesvirus 8 (KSHV) induces the degradation of STAT6 via its RTA. The degradation of STAT6 is shown to be required for KSHV lytic activation, and the ubiquitylation of STAT6 for degradation is dependent on both proteasome and lysosomal pathways. Moreover, the degradation of STAT6 is also observed in other human herpesviruses, including EBV, HCMV, and HSV1, when they undergo lytic replication. The increased expression of a p53-associated tumor suppressor, tripartite motif family like 2 (TRIML2), and its ubiquitylation for degradation are also observed during KSHV lytic replication. The inhibition of STAT6 by small hairpin RNA interference enhances RTA expression, which is further enhanced by RTA-mediated degradation of STAT6 for lytic replication and virion production. Our findings reveal a previously uncharacterized pathway for KSHV and other human herpesviral pathogenesis, which includes the degradation of STAT6.
Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are the primary vectors of dengue virus. Dengue is a viral disease of global importance and is the leading cause of viral hemorrhagic fever in the world. In Bangladesh, dengue is a major public health problem. In 2012, a serological survey was conducted in the city of Dhaka, Bangladesh to determine the magnitude of dengue seroprevalence and the extent of seroconversion between the pre- and post-monsoon periods. The study included 12 administrative wards of Dhaka City Corporation. The study population consisted of 1,200 individuals (1,003 adults and 122 children less than 12 years of age). The seroprevalence of dengue antibodies was 93% during the pre-monsoon period and 57.7% during the post-monsoon period. The seroprevalence increased with age, and the magnitude of seroprevalence was higher in older wards. In addition, attendance in public gatherings and types of mosquito control measures used were significantly associated with seroconversion. The study findings suggest that dengue virus (DENV) circulated in the city during the observation period. Household ecology, defined as the distribution and abundance of Ae. aegypti larval development sites, are important risk factors for dengue infection.
Clostridium difficile is a major cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. The spores of this bacterium are transmitted by the contamination of the gut by spores. The regulation of spore formation is not well understood. Here, we show that the spore surface layers are altered in C. difficile and that this may be important for host colonization. We also show that the regulation of spore formation is less tight in C. difficile than in Bacillus subtilis. We demonstrate that a spore-specific recombination directionality factor is required for skinCd excision and that this factor is encoded by CD1234, a gene under the control of σE and SpoIIID. The excision of skinCd is also required for the onset of σK activity. These results provide a framework for the understanding of spore formation and its regulation in C. difficile.
The human microbiome is a complex community of microorganisms that inhabits the human body. The microbiome plays a crucial role in maintaining human health, and is also associated with many diseases. In recent years, DNA sequencing technologies have been improved to the extent that it is now possible to measure the whole set of microbial organisms associated with the human host. However, the prediction models based on such data are not yet validated for clinical applications. In this study, we used a large number of samples from eight studies to assess the accuracy of the microbiome-disease associations and to compare different strategies for predicting disease states. We developed a software tool to facilitate the analysis of the large metagenomic datasets and provide a publicly available toolbox for disease prediction tasks. Our results show that the prediction models based on metagenomic data can be used to identify specific microbial features associated with different disease states. The identified biomarkers for the “healthy” versus “dysbiosis”-associated microbiome are also very important for future microbiome studies of new diseases.
The genetic factor most strongly associated with slow HIV-1 disease progression is the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) B*5701. HLA-B*5701 subjects with detectable viral load are ideal patients to investigate how the interaction between on-going viral intra-host evolution and immune system relates to risk of disease progression. The present work focuses on a cohort of six untreated HIV-1 infected subjects, all carrying the HLA-B*5701 allele, followed longitudinally from early infection up to seven years. Bayesian molecular clock estimates, based HIV-1 gag p24 sequences, were analyzed in combination with in vitro viral replication capacity and immune activation data. The integration of experimental data with coalescent-based estimates allowed to develop, for the first time, a possible explanation for the correlation between HIV-1 in vivo replication rate and different risk of disease progression in HLA-B*5701 subjects.
Human and animal trypanosomiases are major burdens in rural sub-Saharan Africa. The current chemotherapy against Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of human African trypanosomiasis, or sleeping sickness, and the related cattle disease Nagana, is based on multiple injections of drugs some of which are associated with serious side effects. Treatment of Nagana is commonly based on mutagenic drugs including ethidium bromide and isometamidium chloride, and also on suramin and diminazene aceturate, both with considerable toxicity to cattle. Emerging resistance and adverse side effects against commonly used drugs make it necessary to find new drug targets and develop new drugs. In this study, we identify TbMCP14 as a potential drug target. Expression of TbMCP14 in T. brucei bloodstream forms is required for parasite growth and susceptibility to the choline analogs G25, T3 and T4. Over-expression of TbMCP14 in T. brucei procyclic forms results in hypersensitivity towards T3, whereas down-regulation of TbMCP14 protects mitochondria from drug-induced decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential. Over-expression of TbMCP14 in procyclic form trypanosomes also increases resistance of parasites towards the choline analogs. In addition, down-regulation of TbMCP14 protects mitochondria from drug-induced decrease in mitocharodial membrane potential. We propose that TbMCP14 is involved in mitochondrial energy production, possibly by acting as a mitochondrial proline carrier.
G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest superfamily of membrane proteins, and they are the targets of many drugs. Many GPCRs are referred to as orphan receptors, as their endogenous ligands are unknown. Orphan receptors attract interest from medical institutes and pharmaceutical companies because of their potential therapeutic targets. However, the current understanding of orphan receptors suggests that a significant number of orphan GPCRs do not have endogenous ligands and represent a genuinely orphan group that will never be deorphanized by the discovery of a natural ligand. Here, we used a novel computational approach to investigate the ligand-receptor model for GPCRs. Our study suggests that a significant number of orphan GPCRs attract new perspectives and insights into the ligand-driven deorphanization of GPCRs. Placental mammalian BRS3 is a classic orphan GPCR that lost its connection with its original ligands, NMB and GRP. However, placental mammalian BRS3 underwent positive selection, and in comparison to nonplacental vertebrate BRS3, its protein structure was altered significantly. Our results indicate that placental mammalian BRS3 underwent positive selection to lose the connection to its original ligands and eventually to evolve into a constitutively active GPCR.
Machine learning-based approaches offer high-throughput capabilities and the potential for automation and standardization of sleep scoring. Here, we present a novel algorithm based on neural networks for automatically generating accurate and physiologically plausible predictions. Our method was tested on data from four independent sleep labs and demonstrated de facto human level performance, outperforming current state-of-the-art solutions. The framework is freely accessible through an online server and an easy-to-use interface, contributing to the standardization of experimental studies and enhancing scientific understanding of sleep.
Toxoplasma gondii is a parasite that infects a wide range of warm-blooded animals and is also a major cause of human disease. Toxoplasmosis is often asymptomatic but in immunocompromised patients it can lead to serious complications. Toxoplasma gondii parasites can replicate inside the host cell in a specialized vacuole. Toxoplasma gondii depends on isoprenoids for its survival and replication. Isoprenoids are abundant lipidic compounds essential to many cellular processes including signaling, trafficking, energy metabolism, and protein translation. We have identified a parasite enzyme that salvages farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) and/or geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) from the host. We show that this enzyme is essential in T. gondii but not in other intracellular parasites. We propose that this parasite's ability to manipulate its host to secure the parasite's access to isoprenoids is a potential therapeutic approach against Toxoplasma gondii.
Understanding the evolutionary and genomic changes in new pathogens is vital for deciphering disease emergence and designing effective disease control methods. The banana disease complex caused by the Sigatoka species of Pseudocercospora is one of the most destructive diseases in banana worldwide. The three pathogens that constitute this disease complex are Pseudocercospora musae, Pseudocercospora eumusae, and Pseudocercospora fijiensis, which share a common hemi-biotrophic lifestyle and disease-cycle on their host, often causing similar and easily confounded symptoms on infected leaves. However, despite their similarities, the three species have distinct virulence spectra and can infect different banana cultivars. The evolutionary and genomic changes in these pathogens that underlie their shifting virulence spectra are poorly understood. To address this question, we compared the genomes of the three species and identified a number of genomic modifications associated with changes in their virulence. The results obtained suggest that changes in the size of gene families associated with nutrient acquisition and assimilation are more respectful of the species' virulence profiles, whereas convergent evolution in metabolic pathways that enhance nutrient acquisition, uptake, and utilization contribute to the differences in virulence among the three species. The proposed reason for the increase in virulence of P. eumusae and P. fijiensis is the convergent evolution in metabolic pathways that enhance nutrient acquisition, uptake, and utilization. Our findings provide an insight into the evolutionary and genomic changes in the three pathogens that underlie their shifting virulence spectra and suggest that the evolution of virulence in these pathogens has been driven by recurrent genomic changes on particular molecular pathways.
Visceral leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease that is caused by Leishmania parasites and can lead to severe symptoms and death. The two protozoan parasites that can cause visceral leishmaniasis and an asymptomatic status in humans are L. donovani and L. infantum. The mechanisms resulting in clinical outcomes after infection are poorly understood. In this study, the authors employed a data-driven approach to gain insights into the immunological processes linked to the progression of the disease or protective mechanisms. The analyses uncovered previously unidentified molecular pathways and gene networks associated with the transcriptional profiles of individuals recovering from disease or those who did not develop symptoms after infection. These findings suggest that the activation of protective responses could be useful targets for the development of new therapies for visceral leishmaniasis.
Exploitative individuals can perform fewer cooperative behaviors while still reaping the benefits obtained from others' cooperative behavior. Conflict of interest can arise when cooperating individuals have conflicting preferences or goals, leading to the evolution of complex social strategies. The social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum provides a compelling model for studying the genetic basis of such conflict and cooperation. Amoebae aggregate and differentiate to form a fruiting body composed of dead stalk cells and spores. Different genotypes will aggregate to produce a chimeric fruiting body, resulting in potential social conflict over who will contribute to the reproductive sporehead and who will sacrifice themselves to produce the dead stalk. The outcomes of competitive interactions in chimera appear complex, with social success being strongly partner specific. The proposed mechanism to explain social strategies in D. discoideum involves the production and response to stalk-inducing factors, which are social signals that determine whether cells become stalk or spore. Although measurements of signal production and response can predict social behavior in different strains of D. discoideum, the outcomes of competitive interactions in chimera appear complex and unpredictable.
Proteins destined for secretion are translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In eukaryotes, the signal recognition particle (SRP) is the main pathway for the targeting of mRNAs to the ER. However, recent studies have shown that SRP inactivation or translation inhibition do not prevent targeting of mRNAs to the ER, suggesting that the process may be translation-independent. We have now identified a conserved motif that is enriched in mRNAs encoding secretome proteins in a wide range of organisms, from bacteria to humans. This motif is not dependent on encoded signal sequences or hydrophobic residues, but rather on the presence of pyrimidine residues in the third codon position. We have shown that this motif is present in secretome proteins, including membrane-bound proteins, in both yeast and humans, and that it is enriched in the second and third codon positions. We also show that this motif is enriched in secretome proteins in other organisms, including bacteria. The presence of this motif is important for the secretion of secretome proteins, as its presence is required for the efficient secretion of a secreted protein in yeast. These findings suggest that this motif may be important in the biotechnology industry, for example, to improve the secretion of recombinant proteins.

Answer: They are increasing.
Biofuels research is focused on understanding the energy-related metabolic capabilities of different biological species. Rhodococcus is a bacterium that accumulates 80% of its cellular dry weight in oil, which is a rare trait in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic kingdoms. The genome of Rhodococcus opacus PD630 was sequenced because it has the unique ability to accumulate around 80% of its cellular dry weight in oil. The synthesis of genome sequence and phenotypic information supports a model for the genetic basis for prokaryotic oleaginy and provides crucial insights for engineering next-generation biofuels with genes conserved in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic kingdoms.
Recent technological advancements in DNA sequencing have allowed scientists to examine the relationship between evolution and genomic composition. In this study, the researchers aimed to discover whether particular properties could be extracted that would provide clues on how prokaryotic DNA is composed. The researchers wondered whether protein coding regions carried a greater information potential than non-coding regions. The researchers questioned whether GC content differs in coding and non-coding regions. The researchers found that tetranucleotide frequencies carried considerable genomic information potential, and were therefore used in all statistical tests based on oligonucleotide usage. The researchers also found that GC rich genomes had less varied oligonucleotide usage than AT rich genomes.
Foreign DNA and part of a targeted gene were deleted in mice. The deletion of foreign DNA and part of a targeted gene in mice had striking effects on the regulation of neighboring genes. This study emphasizes the importance of evaluating the local effects on gene regulation to understand the potential consequences and impacts of mutations in mammalian systems.
The main gene involved in regulating the development of gonads in vertebrates is the dmrt1 gene. Despite the well-understood function of dmrt1 as a transcriptional gatekeeper, little is known about how its mRNA is regulated. Here we show that the 3′ UTR of the dmrt1 gene contains a conserved 11-nucleotide sequence motif called the D3U-box. The D3U-box is targeted by two RNA-binding proteins that promote either RNA stabilization in germ cells or degradation in the soma. This new mechanism of dmrt1 RNA stability appears to also regulate the abundance of other transcripts specifically expressed in primordial germ cells.
Understanding the egg stage of mosquitoes can contribute to the development of novel strategies for mosquito control and hampering disease transmission. Mosquitoes lay their eggs in water collections, including some temporary ones. During early embryogenesis, the eggs lose water, which can lead to dehydration and death. The serosal cuticle, produced during embryogenesis, wraps the egg, contributing to protecting it, allowing it to survive outside the water. Eggshell melanization, which is the process that gives eggs their dark color, also contributes to the egg's resistance to water loss. The results of this study contribute to the study of the evolution of insect egg coloration evolution. The results also confirm that the serosal cuticle is essential for the egg's resistance to water loss and that eggshell melanization is a key factor for this resistance.
Infection with parasitic worms, or helminths, is endemic in many developing countries where HIV/AIDS is also prevalent. The purpose of the study was to determine whether worm infections increase the risk of HIV-1 infection. The results suggest that worm infections may increase the risk of HIV-1 infection among individuals with viral exposures. The findings suggest that addressing and controlling helminth infections could be a valuable strategy in reducing the spread of HIV/AIDS in areas where these infections are prevalent.
The segmentation clock is a homeostatic mechanism that controls developmental reproducibility. However, its role in somitogenesis remains unclear. We developed a computational model to address this issue. The model predicted that the clock-independent mechanism of irregular somite formation is caused by noise-induced up-down transition of ERK activity. This mechanism is different from the clock-dependent mechanism of reproducible somite formation. We also found that the clock improves the reproducibility of somites. These results indicate that the segmentation clock plays an important role in suppressing the noise effect to achieve reproducible somite formation.
Proteins perform their biological functions by changing their three-dimensional structure. The three-dimensional structure of a protein is crucial for its function as it provides specific dynamic features for catalytic and binding events. The architecture of the interface between subunits in oligomers is crucial in favoring the dynamics of oligomers, allowing for important biological functions such as ligand binding and allosteric regulation.
Rabies is a viral disease of the central nervous system that is transmitted by the saliva of infected animals. Every year, approximately 55,000 people die from rabies. Most of these deaths occur in developing countries, predominantly in Asia and Africa. The virus is endemic in the domestic dog, which is the main animal that transmits rabies to humans. However, the exact patterns of the spread of dog rabies in endemic regions are not well understood. The studies described in this paper provide essential new information on the transmission dynamics of rabies in Africa. They show that the virus spreads relatively slowly, with occasional long-distance movement of viruses, and a correlation between virus spread and road distances. These findings will greatly assist in future intervention strategies.
Brazil will host the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Brazil has reported the highest number of dengue cases annually over the past decade. The risk of dengue during the World Cup was low. We used historical dengue surveillance data to estimate the risk of dengue in game and basecamp cities. We estimated that between 26 and 59 symptomatic dengue cases would occur among 600,000 foreign visitors. The number of cases would be highest among tourists from Germany, the United States, Mexico, and Colombia. The risk of dengue transmission during the World Cup will likely be low.

Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a neglected systemic fungal infection prevalent mostly in South America. Despite the significant progress in several areas of knowledge since it was described by Adolpho Lutz, in 1908, it still shows high rates of morbidity and mortality and low visibility. Serological tests have been established since the 70's contributing to the rapid, simple and inexpensive diagnosis of the mycosis. However, their performance is not routinely checked, in part due to the lack of external standards. The present study demonstrates a high rate of discordance among the laboratories that are considered to be reference centers for the diagnosis and serological follow up of PCM patients.
Hookworm-related cutaneous larva migrans (CLM) is a parasitic skin disease that affects people living in resource-poor settings. CLM is caused by the migration of hookworm larvae in the epidermis. The disease is associated with considerable morbidity in resource-poor settings. The psycho-social consequences of CLM have never been investigated. We included 91 patients with CLM in a semi-quantitative study on the impact of CLM on life quality. The patients were treated with ivermectin and the impact on life quality was rapidly restored.
American Visceral leishmaniasis is a tropical disease caused by the infection of Leishmania infantum, mainly transmitted through the bite of female sand flies. The main vector of this disease is the Lutzomyia longipalpis species, a cryptic species of sand flies. In Brazil, the incidence of American Visceral leishmaniasis has been increasing, and the disease has emerged in some areas of the Southeast region. In this study, we evaluated the bionomic parameters of one of the sibling species of Lutzomyia longipalpis that occurs in an area of high incidence of American Visceral leishmaniasis in Brazil. We estimated the daily survival rate, population size and duration of the gonotrophic cycle of this sand fly species. The results indicate a high survival rate and low population dispersal of the Lutzomyia longipalpis complex, which could contribute to the reduction of the surviving vector population indirectly by reducing the host biting rate. Moreover, the low dispersal observed suggests that environmental management could contribute to the reduction of vector density. Our findings provide the first published information on Neotropical species involved in the transmission of the agent of American Visceral leishmaniasis.
Commensal bacteria reside in the gut lumen and are vital for host health and homeostasis. However, some commensal species can also harbor virulence factors, such as type III secretion systems (TTSSs), which are also found in pathogenic bacteria. Commensal bacteria reside in the gut lumen and are vital for host health and homeostasis. However, some commensal species can also harbor virulence factors, such as type III secretion systems (TTSSs), which are also found in pathogenic bacteria. The role of TTSSs in host-pathogen interactions is not fully understood. Here we show that the TTSS of enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) is recognized by intestinal epithelial cells, which leads to activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. This activation is mediated by a cue that is not specific to TTSSs, but is specific to active TTSSs. Furthermore, we show that the TTSS-induced NF-κB activation is blocked by the anti-inflammatory effectors of EPEC, indicating that these effectors neutralize the pro-inflammatory response of the host. These findings provide a novel insight into the mechanisms of TTSS-mediated NF-κB activation and suggest that TTSSs are a target for host-directed therapy.
The common RNA binding motif in human proteins is called RRM. The Rbfox protein is a member of a family of tissue-specific alternative splicing regulators. It binds tightly to a specific RNA molecule, pre-miR21. The Rbfox protein has been engineered to bind to a specific RNA molecule, pre-miR21. This could have applications in oncological intervention. The Rbfox protein is able to bind to pre-miR21 with high selectivity and affinity, a property that is not yet fully understood. Molecular simulations can help to understand this by providing insight into the molecular recognition of the Rbfox-RNA complex. This work has used molecular simulations to study the Rbfox•pre-miR21 complex. The simulations were able to reproduce the experimental binding affinity data. This suggests that molecular simulations can be used to predict the structural determinants of the Rbfox•pre-miR21 complex. The simulations also suggested a new mutant, S151T, which is predicted to be more selective and have higher affinity for the pre-miR21 sequence than the S151 suggested in the original design.
Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease that affects over 240 million people worldwide. It is caused by parasitic flatworms, known as schistosomes, which are transmitted through contaminated water. Schistosomes invade the human host and lay eggs in the blood vessels. These eggs cause inflammation, which can lead to various diseases such as anemia, kidney damage, and liver cancer. Schistosomes have evolved several mechanisms to manipulate the host immune system, including the production of enzymes that can degrade host proteins. The major serine protease produced by blood-dwelling schistosomes is SmSP2. SmSP2 is secreted by the parasite and helps it to invade and manipulate the host immune system. The parasite uses this enzyme to degrade proteins involved in host blood coagulation, fibrinolysis, and blood pressure regulation. The parasite also uses this enzyme to manipulate the host immune system by degrading proteins involved in immune response to the parasite. This is the first detailed biochemical and enzymatic characterization of SmSP2. The enzyme processes several proteins and peptides that are involved in host proteolytic cascades, i.e., blood coagulation, fibrinolysis and blood pressure regulation, and may interfere with critical vascular hemostatic processes. Thus, SmSP2 may be a potential target for novel anti-schistosomal therapeutics.
γδ T cells are a unique subset of immune cells that represent an important arm in the immune response against Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection.
The cysteine protease inhibitor produced by the malaria parasite has the potential to inhibit both parasite and host cell cysteine proteases. Plasmodium parasites express a potent cysteine protease inhibitor, which is essential for the parasite's ability to invade host cells. Here, the authors show that this inhibitor is essential for the parasite's ability to invade host cells and to egress from them. The inhibitor was also shown to be essential for the parasite's ability to migrate from the salivary glands of the mosquito to the liver of the mammalian host. The authors also show that the inhibitor is essential for the parasite's ability to form merozoites, which are the infective form of the parasite. The authors show that the parasite's ability to form merozoites is completely restored in mice infected with parasites expressing the inhibitor. The authors conclude that the cysteine protease inhibitor produced by the malaria parasite is essential for the parasite's ability to invade host cells and to egress from them.
Gene expression patterns are fundamental for understanding how cells differentiate and develop into specific cell types. Understanding the role of histone variants in regulating chromatin states is critical for understanding how cells differentiate. Histone variants, such as H2A.Z, play a key role in regulating chromatin states by replacing core histones and modulating gene expression. The histone variant H2A.Z is essential for proper execution of developmental gene expression programs during embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation. However, the mechanisms by which H2A.Z regulates lineage commitment during ESC differentiation are not well understood. Here, we provide a foundation for understanding the significance of H2A.Z incorporation in cell fate determination. We show that H2A.ZAP3, a mutant of H2A.Z that replaces the unique acidic patch domain with that of core histones, is less tightly associated with chromatin and displays altered expression patterns during ESC differentiation. We find that H2A.ZAP3 enrichment at bivalent promoters is reduced and that H2A.ZAP3 is more dynamic compared to H2A.Z. Moreover, H2A.ZAP3 enrichment at bivalent promoters is less sensitive to H3.3 incorporation, a histone variant associated with active chromatin, suggesting that H2A.ZAP3 is more dynamic compared to H2A.Z. These findings provide a critical insight into the role of the H2A.Z acidic patch domain in regulating lineage commitment during ESC differentiation and provide a foundation for understanding the significance of H2A.Z incorporation in cell fate determination.
Lineage tracing methods are used to study the behavior and dynamics of stem cells and tissues in vivo. The purpose of these methods is to study the behavior and dynamics of stem cells and tissues in vivo. In this study, the researchers developed a novel method that utilizes somatic microsatellite (MS) mutations to reconstruct cell lineage trees and understand the dynamics of stem cells. The study focused on the intestinal epithelium, since its stem cells have been extensively studied, and various tracing methods have provided insights into their dynamics. The results confirmed the existence of "monoclonal conversion," the absence of an immortal strand mechanism in colon stem cells, and the separation of the colon into small domains with a common ancestor. In addition, the study revealed that the colon's lineage is separate from other lineages such as the hematopoietic and pancreatic lineages. This work presents a new approach to studying stem cell dynamics and can be applied to studying stem cell dynamics in other systems.
Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has significantly improved the quality of life for HIV-infected individuals. However, HIV persists in the body even after treatment is initiated, and reappears if therapy is stopped. Therefore, developing new eradication therapies that can prevent virus rebound and eliminate HIV persistence is a major research goal. To achieve this goal, researchers are exploring the use of immunotoxins as a complement to ART. Immunotoxins are proteins that kill cells infected with a virus. In this study, the researchers used bone marrow/liver/thymus (BLT) humanized mice as a model to study the impact of ART on HIV persistence. They found that HIV persists in various tissues, including bone marrow, thymus, spleen, etc., despite treatment with ART. However, when an immunotoxin that targets HIV was added to the ART regimen, the number of HIV-producing cells was significantly reduced throughout the body. This study demonstrates that persistent HIV can be successfully targeted and reduced inside the body.
Dengue is a major public health problem in many tropical countries. The clinical features of dengue are often non-specific and are similar to those of other viral infections. Accurate and rapid diagnosis of dengue is essential to guide patient management and to interrupt transmission. The NS1 protein is a product of dengue virus infection and is produced in the blood of infected patients. NS1 detection has been shown to be a useful tool for diagnosing dengue in some studies. We evaluated two commercial NS1 detection assays in a large cohort of patients with acute dengue in Vietnam. The results suggest that these assays are useful in diagnosing acute dengue, particularly if used early in the illness.
Rabies is a deadly disease which is transmitted between animals and humans. It is caused by a virus that affects the nervous system and is usually fatal in humans. The virus is transmitted between animals through the saliva of an infected animal. The virus can be prevented by vaccinating dogs. In order to prevent rabies, it is recommended that at least 70% of the dog population is vaccinated. However, vaccinating a high proportion of dogs is a major challenge, especially in Sub Saharan Africa. In order to address this challenge, a team of researchers from Malawi and the UK investigated the barriers to attending static vaccination points in Blantyre city, Malawi. The team found that distance from home was an important factor in deciding whether or not to attend a vaccination point. People were more likely to attend a vaccination point if they were closer to the point. The team also found that people who lived in areas with a higher proportion of poor people were more likely to attend a vaccination point than those living in areas with a lower proportion of poor people. The team also found that people who were unable to handle their dogs were less likely to attend a vaccination point. The team found that people were less likely to attend a vaccination point if they were unaware of the vaccination campaign.

Tsetse flies are the main vectors for two diseases transmitted by these flies to mammals. The two diseases are sleeping sickness and Nagana. The parasites that cause these diseases are transmitted to tsetse flies through their saliva when they feed on an infected host. Once the parasites have entered the tsetse fly's salivary gland, they undergo multiplication and migrate to the salivary gland surface, where they are injected into the next host during blood feeding. We compared the composition of tsetse saliva before and after the parasite infection. We found that infection with the parasite caused a reduction in the levels of the most abundant saliva proteins. The saliva proteins that are reduced in the presence of the parasite are involved in cell growth and stress tolerance. In addition, we compared the transcriptome of the tsetse salivary gland with that of the salivary gland of mice infected with the same parasite strain. We found that the transcriptomes of the two host environments have different gene expression profiles, which may reflect the adaptation of the parasite to the different host immune and nutritional environments. Our study provides insights into the tsetse-trypanosome interactions at the salivary gland level, which can now be followed through functional investigations.
Visceral leishmaniasis is a serious disease caused by Leishmania infantum and L. donovani. Current treatments for visceral leishmaniasis suffer from toxicity, variable efficacy, requirements for parenteral administration, and lengthy treatment regimens. Miltefosine is the only drug approved against visceral leishmaniasis between 198 and 2014. Prospecting understudied sources of natural products can contribute to the discovery of new antiprotozoal pharmacophores. Streptomyces associated with insects have recently emerged as a prolific and underexplored source of antimicrobials. We isolated two compounds from Streptomyces strains and showed that they are more effective than miltefosine against Leishmania donovani. The two compounds showed potent activity against L. donovani. The selectivity index of the compounds was higher than the positive control (miltefosine).
Trypanosomes are single-celled organisms transmitted by tsetse fly that cause sleeping sickness in humans and infect other mammals. Most trypanosomes cannot infect humans as they die in human serum. However, two mutants of Trypanosoma brucei have evolved the ability to survive in human serum. The frequency of genetic material exchange impacts the spread of genes in trypanosomes, the evolutionary potential of pathogen populations is a product of a number of factors, including the system of reproduction, the potential for gene flow, the effective population size and the mutation rate. Analyses of pathogenic protozoan populations reveal that there is significant debated, but it affects the spread of genes, including those that confer human infectivity, through the population. To gain a greater understanding of T. b. rhodesiense population evolution, the authors studied T. b. rhodesiense populations over time in different geographic locations. The data show that there is significant genetic differentiation between the populations, and the genetic diversity within the Malawi population is much greater than that in the Ugandan samples. These findings provide evidence that T. b. rhodesiense can undergo genetic exchange in the field in Malawi, in contrast to previous studies that have described T. b. rhodesiense as a genetically homogeneous variant of T. b. brucei.
The brain processes information through neuronal networks that contain specifically structured feed-forward and recurrent (lateral) connections. These networks are able to perform a wide range of cognitive processes. The brain's ability to perform depends on the specific connections between neurons. Information is carried between neurons as spikes that are transmitted via connections with different strengths and propagation delays. Experimentally observed learning rules, such as spike-timing-dependent plasticity, can modify the strengths of connections between neurons. In this study, we show how this learning rule can selectively strengthen connections with specific axonal delays. We show that this learning rule can cause networks to learn to perform tasks that require them to respond to inputs with specific frequencies. This learning rule can be used to explain the possible functions that oscillations play in cognition.
Zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis (ZVL) is a severe and neglected disease caused by the protozoan parasite Leishmania infantum. ZVL is transmitted to humans by the bite of infected phlebotomine sand flies. ZVL is highly prevalent in Brazil, where the main reservoir is the dog population. The current control measure for ZVL in Brazil is the culling of sero-positive dogs, but this measure has been highly controversial. In this paper, we used a mathematical model to evaluate the efficacy of community-wide use of systemic insecticides in dogs as a strategy to reduce the number of human infections with L. infantum causing ZVL cases in an endemic area. The results of the model indicate that the novel vector control strategy could be effective in reducing the risk of L. infantum infection in humans, based on the identified combination of different key parameters.
The main cause of all the clinical symptoms of malaria is the blood stage of the parasite life cycle, specifically the invasion and multiplication of Plasmodium merozoites within host erythrocytes. The invasion process is mediated by specific molecular interactions between host receptors and parasite ligands. The parasite proteins that mediate these interactions are localized in membrane-bound internal organelles called micronemes and rhoptries, located at the apical end of Plasmodium merozoites. Timely secretion of microneme and rhoptry proteins to the merozoite surface allows receptor binding, which is a crucial step in the invasion process. The rise in intracellular calcium triggered by exposure to low potassium ions is a key signal for the release of microneme proteins to the merozoite surface. Following release to the merozoite surface, engagement of microneme proteins with their receptors on the surface of host erythrocytes triggers the release of rhoptry proteins. Identification of the signaling pathways involved in apical organelle secretion could lead to the development of inhibitors that block parasite protein secretion, which would be promising leads for the development of novel drugs against malaria.
Tumor vessels are leaky and lack organization. This leads to insufficient blood supply and high fluid pressure inside the tumor, resulting in inefficient drug delivery. In this study, we investigate how anti-vascular drugs can be used to reverse the alterations in tumor vessels and improve drug delivery. We use a mathematical model to simulate the tumor dynamics and its microenvironment including the interstitial fluid pressure. We apply drugs in small doses given in subsequent bolus injections. We show that normalization of tumor vessels can improve drug delivery by increasing the average extravasation of nanoparticles per unit area in the interior region of tumor. We also observe that chemotherapy drugs should be given in larger doses to compensate for the decrease in vessel density caused by antiangiogenic activity.
Dendritic cells are one of the earliest targets of HIV-1 infection. Dendritic cells are highly specialized cells that are able to capture and present antigens to T cells, which in turn activates the T cells to mount an immune response. HIV-1 can subvert the function of dendritic cells by exploiting their ability to capture and present antigens. HIV-1 particles can capture and retain virus particles within dendritic cells, allowing them to spread efficiently and evade the host immune system. This mechanism of HIV-1 capture and spread within dendritic cells has not been fully understood. In this study, we demonstrate that a specific receptor, CD169, is responsible for the capture and retention of HIV-1 particles within dendritic cells. This receptor is highly expressed on the surface of dendritic cells and can capture HIV-1 particles in a host encoded mechanism that is independent of other receptors that have been previously described as being involved in HIV-1 capture and trans infection. This study provides a novel insight into the mechanisms of HIV-1 dissemination and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies to combat HIV-1 infection.
The formation of bone around a cartilage template. This process is called endochondral ossification. It is a complex process that involves the coordinated actions of many cell types.
Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is a newly identified hemorrhagic fever caused by a tick-borne phlebovirus. SFTS is a newly identified emerging infectious disease with a relatively high mortality, caused by the SFTS virus (SFTSV), a recently identified phlebovirus in the family Bunyaviridae. SFTSV was firstly isolated from a patient in Jiangsu province in the Eastern China in 2007. By the end of 2014, over 5,000 cases of human SFTS had been reported in 23 provinces in China. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive survey to elucidate SFTSV ecology in ticks and small wild animals in the SFTS endemic area in Jiangsu province. We detected SFTSV-RNA in both feeding and questing Haemaphysalis longicornis and Haemaphysalis flava, and identified viral RNA in larvae of Haemaphysalis longicornis, collected directly from the environment prior to a first blood meal, indicating that SFTSV could be vertically transmitted in nature. We also detected SFTSV-RNA in small wild mammals including Erinaceus europaeus and Sorex araneus, and detected viral antibodies in two migratory bird species, Anser cygnoides and Streptopelia chinensis. Infection of SFTSV in the wild bird species suggests that SFTSV could be transmitted long distances by them, which is also in agreement with a phylogenetic analysis reported earlier.
Host-pathogen interactions in the ocean are of great interest to scientists, as these interactions are a key factor in shaping the structure of microbial communities and have important ecological and evolutionary consequences. The ocean is inhabited by a vast number of microorganisms, including viruses, bacteria, fungi and algae. Many of these microorganisms interact with each other and with their environment, and viruses are particularly interesting because they are the most abundant microorganisms in the ocean, and they play a key role in shaping the composition and structure of microbial communities. However, we still do not know much about the mechanisms that govern host-pathogen interactions in the ocean. In this study, we used a single-cell approach to investigate the interactions between a single alga, Emiliania huxleyi, and its viruses. We used this approach to study the heterogeneity within infected populations and found that infected cells exhibit a high degree of variability in their viral gene expression. We also found that this variability is linked to the metabolic state of the cell, and that cells that are less susceptible to viral infection tend to have lower levels of viral gene expression. These findings provide new insights into host-pathogen interactions in the ocean and will help scientists to better understand how these interactions shape the structure of microbial communities.
Proteins often interact with each other and cluster together in a protein-protein interaction network (PIN). This guilt-by-association principle has been successfully applied to predict protein function, outperforming alternative methods that do not take the PIN into account. Here, we specifically focus on the dynamic cellular context associated with breast cancer, and potential functional changes induced by the PIN changes in breast cancer relative to the normal tissue. Using transcriptomic samples for 1047 breast tumors and 110 healthy breast tissues from the TCGA, and a comprehensive PIN taken from HIPPIE, we first derive sample-specific PINs and assign sample-specific functions to each gene via diffusion of functions over the network. We then test for significant changes in the inferred functions between normal and cancer samples. We find several biological functions to have significantly gained or lost genes in cancer relative to normal breast tissues, attributed to systematic cancer-associated changes in the PIN topology; we will refer to such functions as cancer-associated. Notably, many of cancer-associated functions are uniquely revealed by our diffusion-based approach to functional assignment, and do not exhibit differential activity in cancer if we rely only on the a priori annotated genes in each sample-specific PIN. We further show that the detected functional change in cancer is also reflected in a consistent association with patient survival risk. Finally, we show that using a diffusion-based functional profile of a tumor provides a better prediction of patient survival and clinical subtypes than the standard alternative, where sample-specific functional activity is quantified based only on a priori annotated genes in each sample-specific PIN.
Host immunity is recognized as a major driver of pathogen evolution. Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are a prime example of a pathogen that has evolved to evade host immunity. IAVs are a major cause of respiratory illness in humans and many other animals. Wild bird populations are known to be a reservoir for IAVs and exhibit a high degree of subtype diversity. Here we report that initial infections with different subtypes of IAVs induce heterosubtypic immunity in wild ducks. The results provide insight into naturally occurring subtype diversity and potential outcomes associated with the introduction of novel viruses like highly pathogenic IAVs in wild bird populations.
Two factors contribute to the rapid evolution of bacteria: short generation time and the ability to exchange genetic material through Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT). Plasmids are autonomously replicating units found in bacteria, and they can carry genes that can be transferred into plasmid-free bacteria. They contribute significantly to HGT. Conjugation, the process through which plasmids are transferred from one bacterium to another, is one of the most important HGT mechanisms. Conjugation is the process by which a DNA element is transferred from a donor cell to a recipient cell. Consequently, conjugation requires direct contact between the donor and the recipient cells. Many plasmids contain antibiotic resistance genes, so conjugation plays a major role in spreading antibiotic resistance. Understanding the regulation of conjugation genes is crucial for designing strategies to combat the spread of antibiotic resistance. We studied the regulation of conjugation genes in the plasmid pLS20 from Bacillus subtilis, one of the most important bacteria in nature. We identified an Xre-type repressor as the main transcriptional repressor that keeps the pLS20 conjugation system in the default “OFF” state. We show that pLS20 conjugation is not activated by recipient-produced signaling molecules. Instead, activation of conjugation is exerted by a plasmid-encoded anti-repressor that belongs to the family of Rap proteins. Moreover, we show that activation of the conjugation genes is ultimately controlled by a signaling peptide that regulates the activity of the anti-repressor. To our knowledge, such a regulatory circuitry mechanism has never been described before for plasmids.

Answer: Loa loa is endemic in forest areas of west and central Africa. Question: What are the other names for Loa loa? Answer: Loa loa is also known as African eye worm. Question: Which other diseases does Loa loa co-infect with in some endemic areas? Answer: Loa loa co-infects with onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis (LF) in some endemic areas. Question: What is the benefit of taking ivermectin for individuals suffering from onchocerciasis? Answer: Ivermectin can provide benefits for individuals suffering from onchocerciasis by helping to control the disease. Question: What is the risk associated with taking ivermectin for individuals co-infected with L. loa? Answer: Individuals co-infected with L. loa have a risk of developing serious side-effects when taking ivermectin. Question: Besides onchocerciasis, what other disease is ivermectin effective against? Answer: Ivermectin is also effective against loiasis. Question: What is the focus of the assessment related to the impact of annual community directed treatment with ivermectin (CDTI)? Answer: The assessment focuses on the impact of CDTI on loiasis, specifically regarding the relationship between treatment adherence and the risk of developing severe complications after ivermectin treatment. Question: Is it possible to eliminate onchocerciasis and/or LF in areas with L. loa using ivermectin as the sole intervention tool? Answer: The feasibility of eliminating onchocerciasis and/or LF in areas endemic for L. loa using ivermectin as the sole intervention tool is discussed.
The genome is organized to facilitate efficient replication and transcription of its genes. In all bacteria, the genome is replicated in the same direction as transcription of the rRNA genes, which are transcribed almost exclusively co-directionally with replication. This co-orientation has been proposed to avoid conflicts between transcription and replication. However, its impact on genome organization and its evolutionary significance are not well understood. We engineered new inversions of the genome while avoiding changes in other aspects of genome organization. We found that reversing the transcription bias in the Bacillus subtilis genome decreased replication rate by ∼30%. Inverted rRNA genes obstructed replication in rich medium, leading to cell death and a significant increase in mutation rate. Our results suggest that the conflict between replication and transcription has favored the co-orientation of transcription and replication in the genome.
> 200 million people are affected by schistosomiasis, a neglected tropical disease. Schistosomiasis is caused by a parasite called Schistosoma mansoni, which lives in freshwater snails. Schistosomiasis is a major public health problem in sub-Saharan Africa, where it is the most common parasitic disease. The parasite is transmitted to humans through contact with contaminated water. The parasite is present in the bloodstream of the infected person, and can cause a range of health problems, including bladder and bowel problems. Schistosomiasis can be treated with drugs, but these drugs can have serious side effects and can be expensive. Therefore, it is important to find new ways to prevent or treat the disease. One approach to finding new treatments is to study the genes of the parasite. This will help to identify potential targets for new treatments. The genome of Schistosoma mansoni has already been sequenced. However, the parasite is difficult to study in the laboratory, and this makes it difficult to understand how the genes are expressed and how the parasite causes disease. In this study, the researchers used a virus called HIV-1 to infect the parasite. The virus was modified so that it could infect the parasite. The researchers then found that the virus was able to infect the parasite and integrate into the parasite’s genome. This is important because it means that the virus can spread and cause disease in the parasite. The researchers also found that the virus integrated into the parasite’s genome in a specific way, and this could help to identify potential targets for new treatments. This study shows that it is possible to use HIV-1 to study the genes of Schistosoma mansoni. This could help to identify new targets for treatments, and could help to find new ways to prevent the disease.
Leptospirosis is a disease caused by pathogenic Leptospira spp., a type of bacteria. Humans acquire leptospirosis primarily through contact with water sources contaminated with urine from infected animals. Rats are asymptomatic carriers of leptospirosis. Asymptomatic rats carry Leptospira in their urine, which can contaminate water sources with their urine. The bacteria can then infect humans through cuts or abrasions. Leptospira isolated from infected rats showed acetylation or tri-methylation of the highly abundant leptospiral lipoprotein LipL32. The modifications may alter protein recognition by the immune response. A synthetic peptide derived from LipL32 with a tri-methylated lysine modification compared to an unmodified version when tested with serum from leptospirosis patients. The synthetic peptide with a tri-methylated lysine modification exhibited less reactivity with serum from leptospirosis patients compared to the unmodified version, suggesting altered recognition by the immune response. This study reports the first-time modification of a Leptospira protein during infection and suggests that these modifications may have functional consequences contributing to bacterial persistence during infection.
The purpose of effector memory CD8 T cell responses is to contribute to pathogen protection and control. Novel CD8 T cell vaccine vectors employ the strategy of eliciting large antigen-specific long-lived effector memory CD8 T cell responses. It is still unclear how novel CD8 T cell vaccine vectors mimic the strategy of natural pathogens. To address this question, mouse models were utilized to investigate the impact of sequential infections on CD8 T cell responses. The results indicate that the host is able to accommodate and accumulate multiple new specificities of inflating effector memory populations at different times. The findings of this study demonstrate that the timing of acquisition of certain unrelated infections may impact upon the efficacy of naturally acquired or vaccine-derived T cell immunity.
The development of exaggerated secondary sexual traits in animals is a fascinating aspect of animal biology. Insects have some of the most dramatic examples of this phenomenon. For example, males of many species of beetles have large, elaborately shaped mandibles. These mandibles are only produced in males, and are only produced in males that have had adequate nutrition as larvae. The critical interactions between the sex-determination pathway and other growth regulatory mechanisms, such as the physiological mechanisms involved in nutrition-dependent expression of these traits, are less well understood. Recent studies in model organisms such as the fruit fly, nematode, medaka fish, and mouse, implicate a group of highly conserved proteins known as DNA binding motif proteins, as major effectors of sexual differentiation. The fruit fly Doublesex (dsx) gene is a promising candidate for the regulation of sexual dimorphisms in insects. Here, we investigate the developmental mechanisms of sex-specific mandible growth in the stag beetle Cyclommatus metallifer, focusing on dsx gene function and its interaction with juvenile hormone (JH) signaling. We show that the doublesex gene is sexually dimorphic in expression, and that knockdown of doublesex leads to sex-specific changes in mandible growth. The results suggest that sex-specific growth of exaggerated sexually dimorphic traits in stag beetles is controlled by doublesex.
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a disease characterised by impaired insulin secretion. In this study, we identified a candidate gene, Regulator of calcineurin 1 (RCAN1), that is overexpressed in human T2D islets and causes mitochondrial dysfunction and reduced insulin secretion in mice. Our findings highlight the importance of mitochondrial function in β-cells and the role of RCAN1 in β-cell dysfunction in T2D.
Rabies is a zoonotic disease caused by lyssaviruses. The virus can be transmitted from animals to humans. There are no further diversification criteria below the species level. The classification of viruses is not only a scientific issue but also a practical problem. The increasing number of available RABV sequences represents a challenge for conventional computation of phylogenetic inferences. Therefore, we developed a new method to cluster RABV sequences based on affinity propagation clustering in combination with phylogenetic analyses. The results were compared with previous studies. The suggested approach offers advantages to phylogenetics in respect to transparency of grouping of RABV isolates and speed.
Answer: The study focuses on analyzing the regulatory network involved in the terminal differentiation of oligodendrocytes. Question: How is the transcription factor Myrf activated? Answer: Myrf is directly activated by the transcription factor Sox10. Question: Where in the Myrf gene is the Sox10-responsive enhancer located? Answer: The Sox10-responsive enhancer is located in an evolutionarily conserved element in intron 1 of the Myrf gene. Question: What happens once Myrf is induced? Answer: Once induced, Myrf physically interacts and functionally cooperates with Sox10 to activate myelin genes. Question: What is the significance of the study in relation to the myelin-specific regulatory network? Answer: The study defines an essential module in the myelin-specific regulatory network of the central nervous system. Question: How does the myelin-related regulatory network differ between the central and peripheral nervous systems? Answer: The myelination in the two compartments of the vertebrate nervous system is regulated by similarly organized, but differentially implemented, regulatory networks. Question: What are the cells in the peripheral nervous system responsible for myelination? Answer: The cells responsible for myelination in the peripheral nervous system are Schwann cells. Question: Which transcription factor is involved in the regulatory module of Schwann cells? Answer: The regulatory module of Schwann cells consists of Sox10 and the Krox20 transcription factor. Question: How do oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells differ in their myelination regulation? Answer: Oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells have similarly organized regulatory networks but implement them differently, resulting in differential regulation of myelination.
Dendritic tree structures are built to collect inputs from other cells in the circuit. The distribution of branch points and termination points in dendrites closely follow the underlying input organization. The characteristic differences between cell types can be observed by analyzing the distribution of branch points and termination points. Computational models based on optimal wiring principles were used to show that the characteristic differences between cell types affect the scaling properties of cell types. The findings have importance for large scale neural circuit analysis.
One-third (1/3) of the world's population is affected by zinc deficiency. Zinc plays a key role in immune function and is crucial for host control of infection. However, the molecular basis for how zinc deficiency compromises host control of infection remains to be understood. Here, we show that dietary zinc deficiency compromises host control of Streptococcus pneumoniae infection by reducing the levels of zinc in the lung. Further, the bacteria are directly exposed to zinc-enriched regions of the lung, which are predominantly located in regions of increased bacterial burden. Collectively, our findings highlight the importance of zinc sufficiency in resisting bacterial infection.
Factors involved in the regulation of gene transcription include genetic factors, epigenetic factors, and trans-acting factors. Epigenetic factors include changes in chromatin structure, which can affect gene expression by altering the binding of transcription factors. Chromatin structure is influenced by the presence of nucleosomes and the deposition of histone modifications. Nucleosomes are regularly positioned at gene promoters, and histone modifications are enriched at active promoters. Antisense transcription is prevalent at gene promoters, where it initiates from between nucleosomes. Antisense transcription is associated with the positioning of nucleosomes and the deposition of histone modifications. Antisense transcription may participate in the establishment and maintenance of a promoter-specific chromatin environment. Coincidence of antisense transcription with promoter-specific chromatin features suggests interplay with other regulatory pathways.
Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease that can cause a wide range of clinical manifestations from asymptomatic to potentially fatal complications. Dengue manifestations may vary from asymptomatic to potentially fatal complications. The diagnosis of dengue is based on clinical and laboratory findings. The confirmation of dengue fatal cases has always been troublesome because in most of cases only one blood sample is obtained and the death occurred around defervescence when positive results of expensive and laborious techniques like viral isolation and viral RNA detection might be difficult. The dengue virological diagnosis in tissues specimens is also achieved by experienced personnel by immunohistochemistry. This study aimed to assess the usefulness of NS1 capture tests as a diagnostic technique to demonstrate DENV antigens in human tissue specimens. The results suggest that the NS1 capture assays may be used as a complement for the diagnosis of fatal dengue cases.
HIV testing is an essential step in the HIV care continuum. However, testing remains low among key populations, including men who have sex with men (MSM) in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). We developed a crowdsourced intervention to increase HIV testing among MSM in China. We recruited MSM from eight Chinese cities and followed individuals longitudinally for 12 months to evaluate the effect of the intervention. We found that the crowdsourced intervention was effective in promoting HIV testing compared to the control period, showing an 8.9% absolute increase (and a 43% relative increase) in HIV testing during the intervention period. The intervention was particularly useful in promoting HIV self-testing. Our study extends previous research on crowdsourcing by using it to develop a comprehensive HIV testing service, evaluating its effectiveness in a pragmatic trial, and assessing the long-term effect of the intervention.
Cytomegaloviruses (CMVs) are viruses that persist within their hosts and are able to block immune recognition by cytotoxic lymphocytes, the main effectors of the immune system. Here, we report that the owl monkey CMV encoded CD48 homolog A43 is a soluble decoy molecule that blocks the interaction between the CMV-encoded CD48 homolog A43 and the host 2B4 receptor. This interaction inhibits the formation of the NK cell immunological synapse and impairs NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. These findings underscore the importance of 2B4-mediated immune responses in controlling CMV infections.
Answer: The main function of the myelin membrane is to act as an insulator and enable fast conduction of action potentials. Question: Which cells are responsible for synthesizing myelin in the central nervous system? Answer: Oligodendrocytes are responsible for synthesizing myelin in the central nervous system. Question: Why is myelin susceptible to lipid metabolism disorders? Answer: Myelin is vulnerable to lipid metabolism disorders because it has a high lipid content. Question: Are extracellular lipids involved in the process of myelination by oligodendrocytes? Answer: Yes, extracellular lipids are involved in the process of myelination by oligodendrocytes. Question: What happens to myelin membrane synthesis when lipid synthesis is inactivated in either oligodendrocytes or astrocytes? Answer: Myelin membrane synthesis is reduced when lipid synthesis is inactivated in either oligodendrocytes or astrocytes. Question: How is myelin membrane synthesis affected when lipid synthesis is inactivated in both oligodendrocytes and astrocytes? Answer: Myelin membrane synthesis is virtually absent when lipid synthesis is inactivated in both oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. Question: How do oligodendrocytes compensate for the deficiency in lipid synthesis when it is inactivated in astrocytes? Answer: Oligodendrocytes bypass the deficiency by using dietary lipids for myelin membrane synthesis. Question: Can a high-fat diet promote myelin synthesis? Answer: Yes, a high-fat diet can promote myelin synthesis. Question: What is the conclusion regarding the contribution of extracellular lipids to myelination during normal brain development? Answer: The conclusion is that extracellular lipids, provided by astrocytes or obtained through diet, contribute to myelination by oligodendrocytes during normal brain development. Question: Is it known where the extracellular lipids involved in myelination originate from? Answer: It is currently unknown where the extracellular lipids involved in myelination originate from.
Proteins are long chains of amino acids, and they are the building blocks of cells. The structure of a protein determines what it can do in the cell, and the sequence of the amino acids determines the structure. Proteins are made of building blocks called amino acids or peptides. Cells create proteins by following the blueprints in the DNA and stringing together amino acids or peptides. Freshly made proteins are typically long, structure-less chains of peptides, but shortly afterwards, most of them fold into characteristic structures. The structure of a protein is important as it determines the functions the protein can perform within the cell. The main technical novelty of this paper is that it uses models more directly matched to the data compared to previous contributions in the same general direction.
The mortality rate of Hantaan virus in Asia is approximately 15%. Alternative vaccinations against Hantaan virus are a priority because there is currently no effective prevention available and the early symptoms of the disease are non-specific, leading to delays in seeking medical care or misdiagnosis. Five novel epitopes were defined in the study on the nucleoprotein of Hantaan virus. The epitopes were restricted by the major HLA alleles in the Chinese Han population. The epitope-specific CD8+ T-cell responses could contribute to the clearance of the virus and the milder severity of the disease.
Answer: This work was conducted in coastal Guinea. Question: What is the focus of Western Africa where Human African Trypanosomiasis transmission is still active? Answer: Coastal Guinea is the last focus in Western Africa where the transmission of Human African Trypanosomiasis is still very active. Question: What are the goals of the Guinean government and its partners regarding HAT control activities? Answer: The goals of the Guinean government and its partners are to reduce the burden of Human African Trypanosomiasis and to eliminate it as a public health problem by 2020, in accordance with WHO's objectives. Question: What impacted the control efforts for HAT during the Ebola outbreak? Answer: The control efforts for HAT were deeply impaired during the Ebola outbreak. Question: What was the aim of the study mentioned in the text? Answer: The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of the Ebola outbreak on HAT screening and caring activities. Question: How were active screening activities affected during the Ebola outbreak? Answer: Active screening activities were interrupted during the Ebola outbreak. Question: Why were passive surveillance and diagnosis severely affected during the Ebola outbreak? Answer: Passive surveillance and diagnosis were severely affected due to the fear of the population to visit the endemic district for confirmation and treatment, as well as the banning of using rapid tests in peripheral health structures and the requisition of healthcare workers and facilities for Ebola response. Question: How many HAT patients were diagnosed and treated during the Ebola outbreak? Answer: Only 59 HAT patients were diagnosed and treated during the Ebola outbreak. Question: How does the potentially high number of undiagnosed human reservoir of trypanosomes impact transmission levels? Answer: The potentially high number of undiagnosed human reservoir of trypanosomes may have contributed to an increase in transmission levels. Question: What is vital in order to stay in line with the 2020 elimination goal for HAT in Guinea? Answer: A rapid revival of HAT control activities in Guinea is vital in order to stay in line with the 2020 elimination goal and to prevent possible bursts of the disease.
Schizophrenia is a mental illness that affects about 1% of the population. It is characterized by symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, and a lack of emotional expression. The main symptoms of schizophrenia include delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, aberrant behavior, lack of emotional expression, diminished motivation, and social withdrawal. The cause of schizophrenia is still unknown. Genetic factors play a significant role in the development of schizophrenia. A woman-specific association of schizophrenia with a genetic variant in the reelin gene is identified.
Candida albicans is a common cause of life-threatening disseminated infections in the nosocomial setting. The disease-causing mechanisms of C. albicans are not yet fully understood. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify novel oral infection-associated genes in C. albicans. We performed a genome-wide transcriptional analysis of samples from HIV+ individuals with oral candidiasis and of in vitro oral infection models. We identified a novel gene, DUR31, which was upregulated during oral infection. We generated mutants lacking DUR31 and showed that this gene is required for the capacity of C. albicans to damage oral epithelial cells, to tolerate killing by neutrophils and to form filamentous structures. DUR31 was also shown to be required for the rapid onset of symptomatic disseminated candidiasis. These results provide new insights into the mechanisms of C. albicans disease-causing processes.
