10.1371/journal.pgen.1003250	[L] The paper discusses the role of epigenetic mechanisms in controlling cellular changes and how they contribute to the development of cancer. It highlights that the methylation of DNA and modification of histone proteins are key factors in this process. The study uses a mouse model to understand early epigenetic changes in intestinal cancer and identifies a set of DNA methylation patterns that are consistent between mouse and human cancers. These findings suggest that these patterns arise early in cancer development and could serve as potential biomarkers for early detection of intestinal cancer.\\n\\n[E] The research paper delves into the epigenetic control mechanisms that govern cellular transcript repertoires and phenotypes, with a focus on the methylation of CpG dinucleotides and histone protein modifications. It emphasizes the role of Polycomb Repressive Complexes (PRC1 and PRC2) and Trithorax Group Complexes (TrxG) in setting repressive or activating marks on histones, and the interaction between these marks and DNA methylation patterns in regulating gene activity and establishing long-term epigenetic memory. The paper presents a comprehensive analysis of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in APCMin mouse model adenomas, revealing a core epigenetic map of intestinal cancer DMRs conserved between mice and humans. The findings suggest that epigenetic patterns in tumor cells arise upon transformation and are not pre-existing in specific cell populations, such as intestinal stem cells. The study also challenges the assumption that promoter hypermethylation universally leads to gene silencing, as only a subset of genes in adenomas follow this pattern. The identification of a conserved set of DMRs between mouse adenoma and human colon carcinoma indicates the potential for early detection biomarkers and highlights the need for further research on additional control elements in gene expression regulation.
10.1371/journal.pntd.0003816	[L] Chagas disease is an illness caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, and it affects people in Latin America. Some people don't show symptoms, while others develop severe heart problems. This study looked at how the different types of the parasite affect the immune response in healthy people. They found that one type, called Y strain, made the immune system more inflammatory, while the other type, called Col cl1.7, made the immune system more balanced. This could explain why some people have milder symptoms than others.  [E] This study investigated the impact of two genetic strains of Trypanosoma cruzi, Y (Tc II) and Col cl1.7 (Tc I), on the immune response of human peripheral blood cells. The findings suggest that while both strains infect monocytes at a similar rate, they differ in their ability to activate monocytes and trigger the production of cytokines. The Y strain induced a more inflammatory response, characterized by higher expression of TNF-alpha and Granzyme A, which may be associated with cardiac pathology in Chagas disease. In contrast, the Col cl1.7 strain induced a more balanced immune response with increased expression of IL-10 and IL-17, potentially contributing to a milder infection outcome. These findings highlight the importance of parasite strain in shaping the host's immune response and disease progression in Chagas disease.
10.1371/journal.pgen.1006818	[L] The study investigates the function of a specific DNA polymerase, pol ν, in mice. The researchers created different mouse models with disrupted Poln genes and analyzed their phenotypes, expression patterns, and meiotic recombination. The results suggest that pol ν has a specific role in germ cells, particularly in testes, but does not appear to be involved in tolerance of DNA crosslinks. The study provides valuable insights into the potential function and expression patterns of pol ν in mammals.  [E] This research paper explores the biological function of the DNA polymerase Pol ν (Poln) in mice by generating and analyzing various Poln knockout models. The study finds that Poln is not essential for embryonic development, viability, or tolerance of DNA crosslinks, but may play a role in germ cells, specifically in testes. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the potential specialized function of Poln in meiotic recombination and its expression patterns in mammals.
10.1371/journal.pntd.0002432	[L] The paper discusses the development of a vaccine for dengue virus, which is a growing threat to public health. Although there are several vaccine candidates in clinical trials, there is an urgent need for a more effective vaccine. The study focuses on the envelope protein domain III (ED III) of the dengue virus, which is responsible for viral attachment and is considered a suitable target for vaccine development. The researchers have developed a technology to express recombinant lipoprotein in high yields for the development of subunit vaccines with high immunogenicity. They prepared recombinant lipidated dengue-2 ED III (LD2ED III) and evaluated its immunogenicity in animal models. The results showed that LD2ED III is highly immunogenic and induces stronger antibody responses than the non-lipidated form of ED III. The vaccine candidate also demonstrated a lower capacity for antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), which is a significant concern in dengue vaccine development. The study provides important information for future clinical studies of ED III-based subunit vaccines.  [E] The paper presents a study on the development of a dengue vaccine candidate using the envelope protein domain III (ED III) of the dengue virus. The researchers used a recombinant lipoprotein expression technology to develop a lipidated dengue-2 ED III (LD2ED III) vaccine candidate and evaluated its immunogenicity in animal models. The results showed that LD2ED III induced stronger antibody responses and had a lower capacity for antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) compared to non-lipidated ED III or dengue-2 virus infection. The study suggests that LD2ED III could be a potential dengue vaccine candidate with a reduced risk of ADE and autoantibody induction. The findings provide valuable information for future clinical studies and the development of tetravalent dengue vaccines.
10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003357	[L] This scientific paper investigates how cells respond to external stimuli, such as hormones, by using protein kinase cascades. The authors study the dose-response behavior of these signaling pathways and how it leads to variability in cellular responses within a cell population. They explore various factors, such as negative feedback and fluctuations in protein expression, that can modulate this variability. The paper aims to understand the mechanisms behind the coordination of cellular responses and the role of cell-to-cell variability in biological processes.  [E] The research paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the cell-to-cell variability in protein kinase cascades, which are essential components of eukaryotic signaling networks. The study focuses on the dose-response behavior of these cascades in response to hormonal stimuli and explores the factors that contribute to variability in signaling pathway activity. The authors investigate the role of negative feedback regulation, fluctuations in initial protein concentrations, and the impact of competitive inhibition and multisite phosphorylation on the steepness of the dose-response curve. The findings provide insights into the mechanisms that cellular systems use to tune the variability of protein kinase signaling, ensuring appropriate responses to external stimuli and highlighting the importance of invariance and ultrasensitivity in various biological processes.
10.1371/journal.ppat.1000431	[L] This paper examines how the immune system responds to a chronic infection caused by the Leishmania donovani parasite. The study focuses on the role of CD8+ T cells, which are crucial for eliminating many types of infections. The researchers found that during chronic infection, CD8+ T cells become less effective at fighting the parasite and can even die off. They also discovered that blocking a specific protein called B7-H1 can help keep these immune cells alive and reduce the parasite's ability to infect the host. This suggests that targeting CD8+ T cells could be a potential strategy for treating chronic infections.  [E] This study investigates the dynamics and regulation of antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses during chronic Leishmania donovani infections in mice. The authors demonstrate that L. donovani evades CD8+ T cell responses by limiting their expansion and inducing functional exhaustion and cell death. They show that blocking the B7-H1/PD-1 pathway can rescue CD8+ T cell responses from cell death and reduce parasite burden, suggesting a critical role for this pathway in suppressing T cell function during chronic infection. The findings provide insights into the mechanisms underlying CD8+ T cell dysfunction during chronic infections and highlight potential therapeutic strategies for targeting these immune cells to improve host protection.
10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003057	[L] The paper investigates the misfolding of prion proteins, which are linked to brain diseases known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs). The authors use computer simulations to study how a change in pH value, mimicking the acidic conditions inside certain cell compartments, affects the protein's structure. They find that a specific amino acid (H187) plays a crucial role in the protein's destabilization upon protonation, leading to changes in the protein's backbone and secondary structure. The study provides insights into the mechanisms of prion misfolding and may help to understand the development of TSEs.  [E] The study focuses on the molecular mechanisms underlying prion protein (PrP) misfolding in transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs). Using microsecond molecular dynamics simulations, the authors investigate the effects of protonation of a specific residue (H187) on the structured C-terminal domain of mouse PrP at pH 4.5, which corresponds to the lowest pH observed in endosomes. They identify R136 as a key partner in the destabilization process and find that the protonation of H187 leads to extensive conformational changes on the microsecond timescale. The study reveals two possible routes for PrP misfolding, either through the unraveling of H2(Cter) alone or the unraveling of H2(Cter) with simultaneous elongation of S1,S2. The findings contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms of prion misfolding and may have implications for the development of TSEs.
10.1371/journal.pntd.0003558	[L] Trachoma is a leading cause of blindness worldwide, and trichiasis, where the eyelashes turn inwards and scratch the cornea, is a complication of repeated Chlamydia trachomatis infections. This study looks at the effectiveness of surgery and epilation (eyelash removal) for minor trichiasis in Ethiopia and found that while surgery was more effective, many people declined surgery and preferred epilation. Epilation was found to be a reasonable alternative for those refusing or unable to access surgery. (E) This four-year follow-up randomized controlled non-inferiority trial of epilation versus surgery for minor trichiasis in Ethiopia found that surgery was more effective for controlling trichiasis, but there was no difference in change in visual acuity and corneal opacity between the two groups. The study highlights the low rates of surgery uptake and suggests that good quality epilation, with regular follow-up and access to surgery if needed, is a reasonable second-line alternative for individuals who decline or cannot access surgical treatment.
10.1371/journal.ppat.0040017	[L] The paper discusses the prevalence of dengue virus (DV) and the need for a safe and effective vaccine. It highlights the role of macrophages in DV infection and the mannose receptor (MR) as a potential receptor contributing to the infection. The study shows that MR binds to DV envelope glycoprotein and that the presence of MR on cells is sufficient for DV binding. It also demonstrates that Th2 cytokines, which are elevated during DV infection, increase the susceptibility of monocytes to DV infection by upregulating MR expression. The findings suggest that understanding the role of MR and its interaction with DV could be crucial for vaccine development.  [E] The study investigates the role of the mannose receptor (MR) in dengue virus (DV) infection, particularly in macrophages. It demonstrates that MR binds to DV envelope glycoprotein and is a functional receptor for DV infection of human macrophages. The presence of MR on the cell surface is sufficient for DV binding, and infection is enhanced by treatment with Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-13), which upregulate MR expression. These findings indicate that MR plays a significant role in DV infection and could be a potential target for vaccine development.
10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005721	[L] In recent years, research has shown that homeostatic mechanisms are crucial in regulating neural activity in the brain. This paper explores the role of these mechanisms in both local and macroscopic levels of neural activity, using computational simulations to investigate how they help maintain stable brain dynamics during interactions with the environment. The researchers adapted a simple model of neural dynamics, incorporating human structural connectivity, and "embodied" it within a virtual environment. They found that the interaction between the brain and environment led to non-stationary dynamics, which could potentially destabilize the system. However, the addition of homeostatic control mechanisms helped stabilize the neural dynamics, allowing the agent to explore and interact with the environment more effectively. The study suggests that a combination of local and macroscopic homeostatic mechanisms is necessary for maintaining flexible and stable brain dynamics during complex interactions with the environment.  [E] The paper discusses the importance of homeostatic mechanisms in the regulation of neural activity at both microscopic and macroscopic levels. The authors use computational simulations to investigate how these mechanisms help maintain stable brain dynamics during brain-environment interactions. They adapt the Greenberg-Hastings model of basic neural dynamics and incorporate human structural connectivity to simulate the dynamics of the brain at rest and during interaction with a simple virtual environment. The study finds that the interaction between the brain and environment introduces non-stationary dynamics that can potentially destabilize the system. However, the addition of homeostatic control mechanisms, both local and macroscopic, helps stabilize neural dynamics and allows for more effective exploration and interaction with the environment. The findings suggest that a combination of local and macroscopic homeostatic mechanisms is necessary for maintaining flexible and stable brain dynamics during complex brain-environment interactions.
10.1371/journal.pgen.1006736	[L] In this study, researchers investigated how the 3D arrangement of chromosomes in the cell can affect gene regulation, specifically focusing on the gene expression and noise in yeast cells. They inserted a gene called MET3pr, which can be turned on without the need for a specific signal, at various locations in the yeast genome and observed how it interacted with other genes. They found that in some cases, the 3D arrangement of the chromosome could lead to increased or decreased gene expression and different levels of gene expression noise. The study provides insights into how the 3D organization of chromosomes can influence gene regulation and contribute to variations in gene expression between individual cells.  [E] This research paper explores the impact of higher-order chromatin structure on gene regulation, with a focus on long-distance chromosomal interactions and their effects on gene expression and noise in budding yeast cells. The authors employed a combination of genetic manipulation, imaging, and 3C (Chromosome Conformation Capture) techniques to investigate the relationship between chromosomal organization and gene regulation. They discovered that while most chromosomal interactions detected by Hi-C do not significantly affect gene regulation, a small subset of interactions could lead to altered gene expression and noise. The study highlights the importance of 3D chromatin organization in gene regulation and provides insights into the mechanisms underlying gene expression variability in individual cells.
10.1371/journal.pgen.1000557	[L] The paper discusses the process of meiosis, a type of cell division responsible for the production of reproductive cells. It explains that during meiosis, chromosomes undergo two rounds of separation, with the first round involving the separation of similar chromosomes, and the second round involving the separation of sister chromatids. The paper emphasizes the importance of a process called "crossover" where segments of DNA are exchanged between similar chromosomes, which helps to ensure the correct separation of chromosomes and prevent the formation of abnormal gametes, which can lead to birth defects and stillbirths. The paper also discusses the role of a protein called Pch2 in this process, and how its absence can lead to defects in chromosome separation and the formation of functional chiasmata, which are structures that help hold homologous chromosomes together during meiosis.  [E] The paper provides a detailed analysis of the meiotic process, focusing on the role of crossovers (COs) in the proper segregation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis I and sister chromatids during meiosis II. It highlights the critical dependence of homolog segregation on the formation of COs, which are facilitated by programmed double strand breaks (DSBs) and subsequent homologous recombination. The paper further discusses the role of the protein Pch2 in controlling the distribution of COs along chromosome arms, as well as its involvement in the regulation of chromosome axis status and the formation of functional chiasmata. The study proposes a model where Pch2 mediates the organization of meiotic chromosomes into multiple modules of assured CO formation, with concurrent imposition of crossover interference. The findings have implications for understanding the mechanisms of CO control and the role of Pch2 in maintaining genomic stability during meiosis.
10.1371/journal.pbio.1000139	[L] This paper discusses how plants protect themselves from harmful microorganisms without an adaptive immune system. They have developed two main defense mechanisms, one that recognizes common features of microbes and another that detects specific proteins delivered by pathogens. The study focuses on a protein called RIN4, which negatively regulates the first defense mechanism and is involved in the control of plant "gateways" called stomata. The researchers found that RIN4 interacts with certain "pump" proteins in the plant cell membrane, affecting the stomata's ability to close in response to pathogens. This interaction helps to prevent the entry of harmful bacteria and increase the plant's overall disease resistance.  [E] This manuscript investigates the role of RIN4, a negative regulator of plant innate immunity, in the regulation of stomatal apertures during pathogen attack. The study identifies six novel RIN4-associated proteins and characterizes the interaction between RIN4 and plasma membrane H+-ATPases AHA1 and AHA2. The results demonstrate that RIN4 acts in concert with AHA1 and AHA2 to regulate stomatal closure in response to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and effector-triggered immunity (ETI). The findings provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying plant immune signaling and the regulation of stomatal apertures during pathogen perception.
10.1371/journal.pntd.0005918	[L] In the past ten years, Europe has experienced increased cases of mosquito-borne diseases like dengue and chikungunya, mainly due to the invasive mosquito species Aedes albopictus. To control the spread of these diseases, local authorities have used various methods such as spraying adult mosquitoes with insecticides and treating breeding sites with larvicides. This study looks at the effectiveness and cost of these methods in preventing the spread of chikungunya and dengue in areas with temperate climates. The results show that larviciding is most effective when done in the summer months and that involving citizens in controlling mosquito breeding sites can be beneficial in small towns. However, the study also notes that the cost-effectiveness of these methods can vary depending on factors such as the size of the town and the number of mosquitoes present.  [E] This paper evaluates the impact of routine larviciding on the transmission of chikungunya and dengue viruses in Europe, which are transmitted by the invasive mosquito species Aedes albopictus. The study uses data from entomological surveillance in northern Italy to parametrize a mathematical model of mosquito population dynamics and control, which is then coupled with a transmission dynamics model and a cost-effectiveness analysis. The results indicate that larviciding is most effective when targeting the adult mosquito population during the summer months, and that involving citizens in controlling mosquito breeding sites can be a cost-effective strategy in small towns. The study also identifies optimal larviciding strategies for different-sized towns and highlights the potential for larviciding to reduce the risk of local transmission of chikungunya and dengue in temperate European areas.
10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004484	[L] This paper discusses how Rhinolophidae bats use echolocation to hunt for prey among vegetation. These bats emit long, narrow-band pulses and listen for changes in frequency and amplitude in the returning echoes, known as glints, which are caused by fluttering prey. The study aims to understand how these bats navigate and avoid obstacles in cluttered environments, despite their long and narrow-band signals not being ideal for obstacle avoidance. The researchers propose a sensorimotor system that relies on the dynamics of the bat-obstacle interaction to result in obstacle avoidance behavior, without needing to reconstruct the 3D spatial layout of reflectors. They use computer simulations to study this system and show that it can avoid obstacles in complex environments without reconstructing the 3D spatial layout of the reflectors present.  [E] The paper investigates the sensorial strategy employed by Rhinolophidae bats to detect prey and avoid obstacles in cluttered environments. The study proposes a sensorimotor system that utilizes Interaural Intensity Differences (IIDs) and time delay of the first echo onset in combination with alternating pinna movements to guide the bat. The system processes only the first millisecond of the echo train and does not require segmentation of the echo signals into contributions from individual reflectors. Computer simulations demonstrate that this simple sensorimotor system can effectively avoid obstacles in complex environments without the need to reconstruct the 3D spatial layout of reflectors. The results suggest that Rhinolophidae bats can use this strategy for obstacle avoidance, and the proposed sensorimotor system could be extended to other bats using frequency-modulated pulses for echolocation.
10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000725	[L] This paper explores the evolution of metabolic networks in biology, discussing whether their development was influenced by random events or driven by optimization processes. The researchers used a simple artificial chemistry model to simulate metabolic tasks and identified three main types of network topologies that were optimal for these tasks. They also found that some molecules and reactions were used more frequently across different tasks, suggesting that these "universal metabolic tools" may have been favored by evolution. The study then compared these findings to real metabolic pathways in E. coli and found some similarities, indicating that principles of efficiency and minimal resource use may have shaped the evolution of metabolism.  [E] The study investigates the long-term evolution of metabolic pathways and their underlying network architecture, using a simplified artificial chemistry model to compute optimal pathways for basic metabolic tasks. The authors identify recurring topological categories among optimal pathways and observe the emergence of "universal metabolic tools" that are relevant for multiple tasks. They then compare these patterns to real metabolic networks, such as E. coli, and find some consistencies in the usage of specific molecules and reactions, suggesting that principles of optimality may have influenced the evolution of biochemical networks. The paper also discusses the potential implications of these findings for understanding the role of metabolism in major evolutionary transitions and the development of synthetic biology and astrobiology applications.
10.1371/journal.pgen.1007908	[L] This paper presents a new method called MAPS, which uses genetic data from individuals to infer population sizes and migration rates across different time periods and geographic locations. The method takes into account the fact that genetic similarity between individuals decreases with distance, and uses this information to build maps of population density and dispersal rates. The authors test the method on simulated data and apply it to a dataset of 2,224 European individuals, finding that it can reveal recent population history and identify changes in migration patterns over time.  [E] The paper introduces a novel method, MAPS, for inferring spatial and temporal heterogeneity in population sizes and migration rates using genetic data. The method utilizes long pairwise shared coalescence (lPSC) segments, which reflect recent coalescent events and can be used to estimate demographic parameters on different time scales. The authors implement a stepping-stone model with a grid of subpopulations and use MCMC sampling to estimate the posterior distribution of migration rates and population sizes. They validate the method through coalescent simulations and apply it to a European subset of the POPRES data, demonstrating its ability to infer fine-scale population structure and changes in migration rates over time.
10.1371/journal.pbio.2006972	[L] This study investigates how insulin resistance affects the healing process of the liver during chronic injury. The researchers found that a protein called insulin receptor substrate 2 (Irs2) plays a crucial role in coordinating the repair mechanisms between the liver's stromal and epithelial cell compartments. In mice with Irs2 deficiency, there was a negative impact on hepatic wound healing, reducing the capacity of the stromal cells to communicate repair signals to the hepatic epithelia. The study suggests that insulin resistance could lead to defects in hepatic injury repair, which may exacerbate liver damage and progression of chronic liver disease due to reduced paracrine fibroblast growth factor 7 (FGF7) signaling.  [E] This research paper explores the impact of insulin resistance on stromal-epithelial repair mechanisms in the liver during chronic injury, focusing on the role of insulin receptor substrate 2 (Irs2) in the process. The study demonstrates that Irs2 is essential for hepatic wound healing and epithelial repair, as it facilitates communication between stromal and epithelial cells via fibroblast growth factor 7 (FGF7) signaling. In Irs2-deficient mice, there was a significant reduction in the capacity of stromal cells to produce and respond to FGF7, leading to impaired hepatic wound healing. The findings suggest that insulin resistance may contribute to defects in hepatic injury repair, potentially exacerbating liver damage and the progression of chronic liver disease due to diminished paracrine FGF7 signaling.
10.1371/journal.pgen.1006579	[L] The research paper discusses the development of complex dendritic branching patterns in neurons and how defects in these patterns can lead to neurodegenerative diseases. The study focuses on the role of the IRE1 protein in maintaining the balance of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a cellular component involved in protein and lipid biosynthesis. The researchers found that inhibiting IRE1 in neurons led to a reduction in dendritic branching, but this effect could be reversed by reducing insulin/IGF1 signaling, which improves ER function. The findings suggest that maintaining ER homeostasis is crucial for neuronal development and may offer new approaches for treating neurodegenerative disorders.  [E] The study investigates the role of the IRE1-XBP1 arm of the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway in dendrite arbor morphogenesis, with a focus on the polymodal sensory neuron PVD in C. elegans. The researchers demonstrate that IRE1's role in dendrite arborization is conserved from C. elegans to mammals and that IRE1 deficiency leads to a secretory block in the PVD neuron, interfering with the targeting of the DMA-1 receptor to the plasma membrane. They further show that reducing insulin/IGF1 signaling can bypass this trafficking block and restore normal arbor architecture, highlighting the importance of ER homeostasis in neuronal development and suggesting potential therapeutic avenues for treating neurodegenerative diseases.
10.1371/journal.pgen.1003839	[L] This paper discusses the importance of maintaining a balanced redox environment in cells for survival, and focuses on the role of the ArcA protein in E. coli. The authors investigate how ArcA regulates gene expression in response to changes in the cell's energy and metabolic state, particularly under anaerobic conditions. They use techniques like ChIP-seq and gene expression profiling to identify and study the binding sites of ArcA, and find that it can directly control nearly 100 operons, mostly by repressing genes involved in energy metabolism. The study provides insights into how E. coli adapts its metabolism to different environments and maintains a balanced redox state.  [E] The study explores the role of the ArcA transcription factor in Escherichia coli under anaerobic fermentative growth conditions, examining its DNA binding locations and regulon. The authors utilized chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) and microarray hybridization (ChIP-chip) to identify 176 chromosomal ArcA binding regions. They discovered an 18-bp sequence motif consisting of two direct repeat elements, and found that the length and architecture of ArcA binding sites exhibit plasticity. The study also analyzed the genome-wide mRNA expression profiles and identified 85 operons directly regulated by ArcA. The results suggest that ArcA plays a major role in repressing genes encoding enzymes for aerobic respiratory metabolism, thereby contributing to NAD+ sparing and maintaining redox balance during anaerobic glucose fermentation. The findings provide a more comprehensive understanding of the physiological role of ArcA in E. coli and its mechanisms of transcriptional regulation.
10.1371/journal.pgen.1001271	[L] The paper discusses the role of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis in regulating various bodily functions such as stress response, growth, and reproduction. It highlights the importance of pituitary hormones and the factors that can lead to pituitary tumor formation. The study focuses on a gene called usp39, which is involved in RNA splicing and is found to be crucial for pituitary development. The researchers discovered that a mutation in usp39 leads to increased cell lineages in the pituitary gland, causing it to expand. This expansion is due to a decrease in a protein called Rb1 and an increase in a protein called E2F4. The study provides insights into how pituitary cell growth is controlled and suggests that the usp39 gene may play a broader role in neuronal cell lineage development.  [E] The research paper delves into the complex interactions of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, which is responsible for regulating a wide range of physiological processes including stress response, growth, lactation, metabolism, and reproduction. The study emphasizes the critical role of pituitary hormones and the various cell types involved in their secretion. It also discusses the factors contributing to pituitary hyperplasia and tumor formation, highlighting the potential health risks associated with untreated pituitary tumors. The investigation centers on the usp39 gene, which is involved in the assembly of the spliceosome, an essential component of the RNA splicing machinery. The study identifies a mutant zebrafish model with a nonsense mutation in usp39, leading to abnormal pituitary development and expansion of adenohypophyseal cell lineages. The research reveals that this expansion is due to a decrease in the expression of the rb1 gene and an increase in the expression of e2f4, suggesting that the usp39 gene plays a crucial role in regulating pituitary cell growth and differentiation. The findings provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying pituitary development and tumorigenesis, and suggest that the usp39 gene may have broader implications for neuronal cell lineage development.
10.1371/journal.ppat.1003200	[L] The paper discusses how viral infections in fetuses and young infants can lead to abnormal brain development, resulting in long-term neurological issues. The study uses a mouse model to understand the impact of a specific virus, murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV), on the developing brain. The researchers found that infection with MCMV led to a decrease in the proliferation of neural progenitor cells, which are crucial for brain development. This was associated with an increase in inflammation within the brain. Treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs, such as prednisolone, was able to normalize the proliferation of these cells and correct the developmental abnormalities caused by the virus. The study suggests that inflammation, rather than direct viral damage, may be a key factor in the development of brain abnormalities in infected infants.  [E] The paper investigates the mechanisms by which viral infections, specifically murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV), disrupt normal central nervous system (CNS) development in neonatal mice, leading to long-term neurological sequelae. The study demonstrates that MCMV infection results in decreased proliferation of granule neuron progenitor cells (GNPCs) in the cerebellum, associated with increased inflammation within the CNS. This inflammation is characterized by the presence of activated macrophages and microglia, as well as upregulated expression of proinflammatory cytokines. Treatment with the anti-inflammatory drug prednisolone attenuated the inflammatory response and restored normal GNPC proliferation and cerebellar development. These findings suggest that the neurodevelopmental abnormalities observed in the context of congenital CMV infection may be mediated by host-derived inflammation rather than direct viral cytopathology, and highlight the potential therapeutic utility of anti-inflammatory interventions in mitigating the consequences of such infections on brain development.
10.1371/journal.pntd.0001428	[L] Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is a common cause of diarrhea in developing countries, leading to millions of infections and hundreds of thousands of deaths in young children each year. There is currently no effective vaccine for ETEC, and researchers are exploring various antigens for potential vaccine development. This study investigates the role of autotransporter proteins, which are surface-expressed molecules, in ETEC infections and their potential as vaccine candidates. The researchers identified conserved autotransporter proteins in ETEC strains and found that they elicit an immune response in both mice and humans during infection. Vaccination with the passenger domains of these proteins resulted in increased antibody levels and provided protection against ETEC colonization in mice. This study supports the potential of autotransporter proteins as vaccine candidates for ETEC.  [E] Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is a significant cause of diarrheal illness in developing countries, resulting in substantial morbidity and mortality, particularly in young children. Despite the clear need for an effective vaccine, the genetic heterogeneity of ETEC and the limitations of current antigens have hindered vaccine development efforts. This study explores the potential of conserved, chromosomally-encoded autotransporter proteins as vaccine candidates against ETEC. The researchers identified multiple autotransporters in ETEC strains and selected those absent in non-pathogenic E. coli strains for further investigation. They found that the passenger domains of these autotransporters are surface-expressed, immunogenic, and recognized during both experimental and natural infections. Vaccination with the passenger domains of two conserved autotransporters, Ag43 and pAT, resulted in increased antibody responses and provided significant protection against ETEC colonization in a murine model. This study contributes to the understanding of ETEC pathogenesis and supports the potential of autotransporter proteins as novel vaccine candidates to combat this important global health challenge.
10.1371/journal.pntd.0007100	[L] Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a severe and often deadly disease caused by the CCHF virus, which is spread by certain ticks. It affects many countries across Africa, Asia, and Europe, and can cause serious symptoms like fever, muscle pain, and bleeding. The virus can also be passed from animals to humans, and there is a risk of outbreaks. Currently, there is no effective vaccine, and diagnosis and treatment are crucial for survival. This study looks at cases of CCHF in Oman from 1995 to 2017, investigating the virus's genetic makeup and how it might be transmitted, which could help in preventing the disease. [E] This comprehensive study provides an in-depth analysis of the clinical, epidemiological, and molecular characteristics of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in Oman, a disease endemic to the region and under-recognized globally. The research spans over two decades, from 1995 to 2017, and documents 88 cases of CCHF, with a notable increase in reported cases post-2011. The study elucidates the genetic lineage of the CCHF virus in Oman, identifying it as Asia lineage 1 (clade IV), which is consistent with isolates from the UAE and suggests a prolonged circulation of this particular strain in the region. The findings underscore the importance of enhanced surveillance, public awareness, and preventive measures, particularly during high-risk activities such as animal slaughtering during religious festivals. The study also highlights the need for prospective research to better understand the full spectrum of CCHF disease, including milder cases, and the potential for CCHF in travelers from the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. The data presented in this study are instrumental for informing public health strategies aimed at controlling and preventing CCHF, not only in Oman but also in neighboring regions where the disease is endemic.
10.1371/journal.pgen.1000919	[L] The research paper discusses the concept of robustness in biological systems, using the cell cycle of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model. The authors explore how intracellular biochemical parameters are optimized to maximize the performance of biological systems, while also maintaining robustness against environmental changes and mutations. They use a method called "genetic tug-of-war" to measure the copy number limit of overexpression of certain genes, and they compare these results with a mathematical model called Chen's model. The study finds that the robustness of a cellular system can be assessed by how much each intracellular parameter can change without disrupting the system's function. The authors also discuss the mechanisms underlying the robustness and fragility of the yeast cell cycle in response to overexpression of certain genes.  [E] The study investigates the robustness of the budding yeast cell cycle by examining the copy number limits of gene overexpression and comparing these with predictions from Chen's model. The authors use a genetic experiment called "genetic tug-of-war" (gTOW) to measure the copy number limit of overexpression for 30 cell cycle-related genes, finding variations from less than 2 to over 100. They define robustness as the ability of a cellular system to maintain its normal operation even when the amount of a certain component fluctuates significantly. The study identifies the molecular mechanisms behind the observed robustness and fragility in the yeast cell cycle, suggesting that dosage imbalance between enzyme and inhibitor causes cellular fragility. The authors propose that the knowledge about cellular robustness can be effectively used to improve integrative mathematical models. The study also highlights the importance of quantitative regulation in maintaining cellular robustness against overexpression of certain genes.
10.1371/journal.ppat.1007416	[L] The research paper discusses the role of STAT6, a protein that helps in immune response, in the life cycle of Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), a virus known to cause certain types of cancer. The study found that KSHV triggers the degradation of STAT6 during its lytic phase, a process where the virus replicates itself. This degradation helps the virus to produce more virion particles, or virus progeny. The study also found that a protein called TRIML2, which is a tumor suppressor, is increased when STAT6 is degraded. This increase in TRIML2 helps the virus to survive and produce more virus particles. The findings suggest that controlling the levels of STAT6 and TRIML2 could be a potential strategy for treating diseases caused by KSHV.  [E] The study elucidates the molecular mechanisms underlying the degradation of STAT6 during the lytic replication of KSHV, which is pivotal for the production of virion particles. It demonstrates that RTA, a viral antigen, induces the degradation of STAT6 through both proteasomal and lysosomal pathways, leading to an increase in TRIML2, a p53-associated tumor suppressor. This increase in TRIML2 contributes to the cell stress response and prolongs survival during lytic replication. The findings provide novel insights into the regulatory network of KSHV, highlighting the significance of STAT6 degradation and TRIML2 ubiquitylation in the virus life cycle and suggesting potential therapeutic targets for KSHV-associated diseases.
10.1371/journal.pntd.0005475	[L] The spread of dengue virus has been unprecedented in recent times, affecting millions of people worldwide. This study aimed to determine the seroprevalence and seroconversion rates of dengue infection in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and identify the risk factors associated with its transmission. The results revealed a high seroprevalence rate, indicating widespread exposure to the virus, and a significant number of new infections occurred during the monsoon season. Factors such as age, indoor potted plants, and mosquito control measures were found to be associated with dengue infection, highlighting the need for effective public health measures to control its spread.  [E] The study reported a high dengue seroprevalence (80% pre-monsoon and 90% post-monsoon) and a considerable seroconversion rate (57.7%) in Dhaka, indicating intense dengue virus circulation and transmission during the observation period. Various risk factors, including age, indoor potted plants, and types of mosquito control measures, were significantly associated with dengue seroprevalence and seroconversion. The findings underscore the importance of household-level interventions and vector control measures to reduce dengue transmission and emphasize the need for an active surveillance system to better understand and prevent the spread of dengue in the region.
10.1371/journal.pgen.1006312	[L] This paper discusses the process of spore formation in bacteria, specifically focusing on a type of bacteria called Clostridium difficile. The authors explore the role of a specific gene, skinCd, in the formation of spores and its impact on the structure and function of these spores. They find that skinCd is essential for proper spore development and that its removal can lead to changes in the spore's surface layers, potentially affecting the spore's ability to survive and cause infection.  [E] The study investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying spore development in Clostridium difficile, with a particular focus on the role of the skinCd element. The authors demonstrate that skinCd excision is crucial for the proper assembly of the spore surface layers and that this process is regulated by the coordinated expression of CD1231 and CD1234 genes. The findings suggest that the premature activation of σK, a key factor in spore development, can lead to alterations in the spore's structural and functional properties, which may have implications for the persistence and infectivity of C. difficile.
10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004977	[L] The human microbiome, consisting of all the microorganisms that live in our body, is really important for our health. Scientists have been studying it a lot and found that it can help us understand some diseases better. They use special machines to look at the different types of bacteria and other tiny living things in our body. This study used a computer program to help make sense of all that information from several different studies. They found some good ways to use this information to guess if someone might have certain diseases, just by looking at the微生物 living in their body. This could potentially help doctors in the future.   [E] This meta-analysis paper discusses the utility of the human microbiome in diagnosing diseases. The authors processed shotgun metagenomic data from 2424 samples across eight studies to evaluate the accuracy of predictive models based on microbiome profiles. They used machine learning classifiers to assess the predictive power of microbiome features for disease states and their transferability across independent datasets. The study found that incorporating healthy samples from different cohorts improved disease prediction accuracy, and that certain species are associated with a general non-healthy microbiome state, rather than specific diseases. The authors developed a software tool, MetAML, which is openly accessible and includes features for biomarker discovery, to facilitate further research and validation of new methods for disease classification using metagenomic data.
10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003830	[L] The study investigates the relationship between the rate of HIV-1 disease progression and genetic factors in patients. It found that patients with higher CD4+ T cell counts during early infection were more likely to control HIV-1 replication and had a lower risk of progressing to AIDS. The study also found that the virus evolving faster in high-risk progressors was not due to stronger immune responses or fitter viral variants. Instead, an alternative mechanism involving the highly significant inverse correlation between baseline CD4+ T cell count and average viral replication rate was proposed. This suggests that maintaining high CD4+ T cell counts in early infection may help control HIV-1 replication and slow down disease progression.  [E] The paper explores the association between HIV-1 intra-host evolution and disease progression in patients carrying the HLA-B*5701 allele, a genetic factor known to be linked to slow disease progression. By analyzing longitudinal gag p24 sequence data from untreated HLA-B*5701 subjects with different risks of disease progression, the study finds that lower viral evolutionary rates in low-risk progressors are correlated with higher baseline CD4+ T cell counts. The results suggest that subjects with higher CD4+ T cell counts early in infection can better control viral replication, leading to a lower risk of progressing to AIDS. The study also rules out the possibility that stronger immune responses or fitter viral variants explain the observed differences in viral evolution between high-risk and low-risk progressors. Instead, an alternative mechanism involving a significant inverse correlation between baseline CD4+ T cell count and viral replication rate is proposed, indicating that maintaining higher CD4+ T cell counts during early infection may help constrain viral evolution and slow disease progression.
10.1371/journal.ppat.1004875	[L] The paper discusses the problem of drug resistance in African trypanosomes, which are parasites causing serious diseases in sub-Saharan African countries. Current treatments involve multiple drug injections with serious side effects and there are known cases of drug resistance. The researchers used a screening method with an RNAi library to identify a gene, TbMCP14, which when down-regulated, increased the resistance of the parasites to certain drugs. They found that TbMCP14 is essential for the normal growth of these parasites and is involved in the metabolism of proline for energy production. The study suggests that this gene could be a potential target for new drug treatments.  [E] The paper investigates the role of the mitochondrial carrier protein TbMCP14 in the drug susceptibility of African trypanosomes, which are protozoan parasites causing significant public health and economic issues in sub-Saharan Africa. The study reveals that down-regulation of TbMCP14 through RNA interference (RNAi) increases the resistance of trypanosomes to choline analogs, such as G25, T3, and T4, which are known to be toxic for the parasites. The findings indicate that TbMCP14 is essential for the normal growth of trypanosomes and is involved in proline metabolism, suggesting its potential as a target for the development of new therapeutic strategies against these parasites.
10.1371/journal.pbio.3000175	[L] The study explores the evolution and function of a receptor called bombesin receptor subtype-3 (BRS3) in vertebrates. It was found that BRS3 in non-placental vertebrates, such as amphibians and reptiles, bind to specific peptides called GRP and NMB, triggering a cellular response. However, in placental mammals, such as humans, BRS3 has lost this ability due to changes in its structure and now functions independently of these peptides. This change in BRS3 is believed to have occurred due to positive selection, an evolutionary process where certain traits become more common in a species over time. The study suggests that BRS3 may have different roles in placental mammals compared to other vertebrates.  [E] The research investigates the structural and functional evolution of the bombesin receptor subtype-3 (BRS3) in vertebrates, revealing that while non-placental vertebrates retain the ability of BRS3 to bind to the peptides gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) and neuromedin B (NMB), placental mammals have undergone positive selection leading to a significant structural alteration of BRS3. This results in the loss of peptide binding affinity and a ligand-independent activation of G-protein subunits Gs, Gq, and G12, suggesting a shift in the physiological role of BRS3 in placental mammals. The study provides insights into the adaptive evolution of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and challenges the notion that all orphan GPCRs have endogenous ligands, proposing that some may remain orphan due to constitutive activity.
10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006968	[L] The paper presents a novel framework called SPINDLE for automatic sleep scoring of animal EEG/EMG recordings. The framework employs a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and hidden Markov models (HMM) to achieve high predictive performance and generalization across different experimental settings and labs. The CNNs learn robust features from the preprocessed time-frequency channels of EEG/EMG, while the HMM models the transition dynamics between vigilance states and suppresses physiologically impossible transitions. The method also includes a dedicated CNN for artifact detection. The results show that SPINDLE achieves high accuracy, comparable to human experts, and is capable of preserving predictive performance across different animal species and sleep labs.  [E] The study introduces SPINDLE (Sleep Phase Identification with Neural networks for Domain-invariant LEearning), a deep learning-based framework for automated sleep scoring in rodents, which outperforms traditional manual methods and other automated approaches. The framework combines CNNs for feature extraction and HMMs for modeling vigilance state transitions, and also includes an additional CNN for artifact detection. The method was rigorously evaluated and demonstrated high accuracy and generalizability across different animal cohorts, labs, and species without requiring additional parameter calibration. The results suggest that SPINDLE holds great promise for improving standardization of sleep analysis across laboratories.
10.1371/journal.ppat.1003665	[L] Toxoplasma gondii is a parasite that can cause serious diseases in humans and animals. It can change how the body works to survive and make more of itself. There are some medicines that can stop the parasite from growing, but they don't always work because the parasite can also use parts from the host body. Scientists found that a certain medicine called statins, which are usually used for cholesterol, can also help fight the parasite. They suggest using both statins and another medicine called bisphosphonates together to better target the parasite and stop it from using the host's resources.  [E] The study explores the complex interactions between Toxoplasma gondii, an intracellular parasite, and its host, focusing on the parasite's reliance on isoprenoids, essential lipid compounds necessary for its survival. The researchers discovered that T. gondii can both synthesize and salvage isoprenoids from the host, with varying dependence on this salvage mechanism based on the host cell type and environmental conditions. The study demonstrates that statins, a class of drugs typically used to lower cholesterol, can inhibit the parasite's growth by targeting the host's mevalonate pathway, which T. gondii lacks but relies on through salvage. The researchers propose a "double-hit" therapeutic strategy, combining statins with bisphosphonates, another drug class, to simultaneously target both the parasite's and host's isoprenoid pathways. This approach shows promise in enhancing efficacy and potentially treating infections caused by other intracellular parasites.
10.1371/journal.pgen.1005904	[L] This paper discusses the importance of bananas and plantains as staple food crops and the threat posed by diseases like the Sigatoka disease complex. The authors sequenced the genomes of three closely related fungal species causing this disease and found significant differences in their gene content and genome organization. These differences are attributed to the accumulation of transposable elements and the breakdown of macrosynteny among the species. The study also highlights the convergent evolution in specific molecular pathways that may have contributed to the increased virulence of two of the species. The findings provide valuable insights into the pathobiology of these fungi and can help inform strategies for managing the disease and safeguarding global food security.  [E] This study investigated the genomic basis of virulence differences among three closely related Pseudocercospora species causing the devastating Sigatoka disease complex in bananas. Genome sequencing and comparative analysis revealed marked variations in genome sizes, gene content, and organization among the species, which correlate with their differences in virulence. The authors found evidence of convergent evolution in specific molecular pathways related to metabolism and nutrient acquisition, which may have facilitated the increased virulence of Pseudocercospora eumusae and Pseudocercospora fijiensis. The findings have important implications for understanding the evolutionary processes underlying the emergence of new pathogens and the development of effective disease control strategies.
10.1371/journal.pntd.0005123	[L] Leishmaniasis is a disease caused by the protozoan parasites Leishmania donovani or L. infantum (chagas), which can result in a range of symptoms from asymptomatic infection to severe visceral leishmaniasis (VL). The immune response to the infection is complex and involves various molecular mechanisms. This study investigates the patterns of gene expression in the peripheral blood of humans with different states of infection with L. infantum, using genome-wide profiling strategies. The findings reveal transcriptional profiles that could help identify pathological or protective responses to the infection, and may aid in the development of new strategies for treatment and prevention.  [E] Infections with Leishmania donovani or L. infantum (chagas) can lead to a spectrum of clinical outcomes, from asymptomatic infection to active visceral leishmaniasis (VL). The immune response to these infections is multifactorial and complex. This study utilized genome-wide gene expression profiling to investigate the transcriptional activity of the immune response in human whole blood during distinct states of L. infantum infection. The results provide insights into the immunobiology of human VL and could inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies.
10.1371/journal.pbio.1001039	[L] This paper examines the social behavior of the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, which forms cooperative groups to survive harsh conditions. The study proposes that the seemingly complex social behavior can be explained by a simple mechanism involving the production and response to social signals. The researchers used mathematical models and genetic experiments to show that differences in these signals can lead to various social strategies, such as self-promotion or coercion, and that a single gene mutation can change the amoeba's social behavior. The findings suggest that the evolution of social behavior can be influenced by a combination of simple rules and underlying genetic complexity.  [E] The study investigates the genetic basis of social conflict and cooperation in the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, which forms fruiting bodies composed of dead stalk cells and a sporehead. The authors hypothesize that variation in clonal and chimeric social behavior is modulated by a mechanism based on the production of and response to social signals that govern developmental differentiation. Using mathematical modeling and genetic selection experiments, they demonstrate that differences in signal production and response can lead to complex social behaviors, such as self-promotion and coercion, and that a single gene mutation (lsrA) can alter these behaviors. The results challenge the notion that partner-specific responses require a recognition mechanism and suggest that social strategies may be determined by a set of knowable parameters related to signal production and response. The study provides insights into the evolution of social behavior and highlights the importance of understanding the basic rules governing interactions, as well as the genes and pathways underlying social behavior.
10.1371/journal.pgen.1008248	[L] The research paper discusses the importance of mRNA targeting and localized translation in controlling protein synthesis. It focuses on the role of mRNA localization in the establishment of cell polarity and its crucial function in the proper functioning of the cell. The paper identifies a specific motif, SECReTE, which enhances mRNA stability, localization, and translation at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The study reveals that this motif is not only present in eukaryotes but also in prokaryotes, suggesting a conserved role in the translational control of mRNAs. The findings of this research could have practical applications in the field of biotechnology, particularly in improving the production of recombinant proteins.  [E] The study investigates the role of mRNA localization in protein synthesis, particularly in the context of secretory and membrane proteins. It identifies a novel cis-regulatory element, termed SECReTE, which consists of a repetitive pyrimidine-rich motif found in the mRNA sequences of secretome proteins. The presence of SECReTE is associated with enhanced mRNA stability, localization to the ER, and translation efficiency. The research demonstrates that SECReTE is a conserved element across various organisms, from prokaryotes to eukaryotes, and plays a significant role in the regulation of protein secretion. The findings have potential implications for biotechnological applications, such as improving the production of recombinant proteins in yeast.
10.1371/journal.pntd.0005718	[L] The paper discusses the growing concern of mosquito-borne infectious diseases like dengue, Zika, chikungunya, and yellow fever, primarily transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito. The increasing number of cases and the lack of effective vaccines and treatments highlight the importance of vector control. The study focuses on the genetic structure and origins of A. aegypti populations in California (CA), finding evidence of multiple introductions of the mosquito in the state and low genetic diversity in Southern CA populations. The results have implications for vector control strategies, as they suggest that CA and other regions with temperate climates may be more vulnerable to mosquito invasions than previously thought.  [E] The research investigates the population genetics of Aedes aegypti, the primary vector for mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue, Zika, chikungunya, and yellow fever, in California. The study identifies multiple introductions of A. aegypti into CA from different regions and reveals a distinct genetic differentiation between Northern and Southern CA populations. The findings suggest that the mosquitoes likely invaded CA years before initial detection and that the populations may have responded differently to control measures. The results have significant implications for vector control, highlighting the need to understand invasion dynamics to effectively monitor and prevent disease outbreaks in California and other regions.
10.1371/journal.pgen.1002219	[L] The paper discusses biodiesel, a fuel made from organic compounds like sugars and organic acids, and focuses on the use of a specific type of bacteria called Rhodococcus. These bacteria can store and produce high levels of lipids, making them a good target for biodiesel production. The researchers sequenced the genome of Rhodococcus and found that it has the ability to produce a variety of lipids and can break down different types of hydrocarbons. They also found that it can grow on a wide range of organic compounds, making it a promising candidate for industrial processes to convert waste into biofuels.  [E] The study presents a genomic and metabolic analysis of Rhodococcus opacus PD630, a chemoheterotrophic bacterium with potential for biofuels development. The authors generated a high-quality draft sequence of the R. opacus PD630 genome and performed metabolic reconstruction, identifying 8632 genes and 1735 metabolic reactions. They found that Rhodococcus has a unique storage lipid cycle that leads to the accumulation of triacylglycerols (TAGs) and wax esters (WEs), and can utilize a wide range of organic compounds as carbon sources. The study also highlights the potential of Rhodococcus for industrial processes due to its high substrate tolerances and ability to grow rapidly. The findings provide critical insights for biofuels development and offer a template for further refinement of the metabolic model with integration of data from genetics, biochemistry, metabolomics, lipidomics, and transcriptomics.
10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000057	[L] This paper examines the patterns and frequencies of different lengths of DNA segments in prokaryotic genomes, which are the genetic material of bacteria and archaea. The study finds that certain patterns can reveal information about the organisms' environment, their replication process, and their regulation of gene expression. The results suggest that there is a relationship between the composition of these DNA segments and the overall genetic information carried by the organism. The findings could have implications for understanding the evolution and function of prokaryotic genomes.  [E] This study investigates the oligonucleotide distributions in prokaryotic DNA, specifically focusing on the frequencies of di- to tetranucleotides in bacterial and archaeal genomes. The research finds that tetranucleotide frequencies carry considerable genomic information potential and can be used to detect biases and patterns in the DNA sequence. The study also explores the relationship between oligonucleotide distributions and various properties of prokaryotes, such as their environment, replication start and stop positions, and transcription and regulation sites. The results show that there is a correlation between GC content and oligonucleotide usage, and that coding regions are more biased than non-coding regions. The findings suggest that the oligonucleotide distributions in prokaryotic DNA can provide insights into the organisms' evolution, function, and adaptation to their environment.
10.1371/journal.pgen.1005691	[L] The paper discusses the impact of transgene integration on the local genome function in mammals, focusing on the effects of random integration and targeting events. The study uses RNA sequencing to analyze the expression of targeted genes and surrounding genes in adult mice, finding that a significant number of genes are up- or down-regulated near the targeted genes. The results suggest that the local gene expression changes due to the targeting event may have consequences for the phenotypes observed in targeted mutants.  [E] The study evaluates the local effects of transgene integration on gene expression in mammalian systems, specifically in C57BL/6N adult mice, using RNA-seq to analyze the targeted genes and flanking genes. The findings reveal that a considerable proportion of targeted genes exhibit changes in gene expression, with up- or down-regulation of neighboring genes occurring more frequently in deletion mutants compared to gene trap mutants. The results highlight the importance of considering the local genome environment when evaluating the consequences of transgene integration and suggest that local gene expression changes may contribute to phenotypic outcomes in targeted mutants.
10.1371/journal.pbio.3000185	[L] This paper investigates the role of the mab-3/doublesex/dmrt1 gene orthologs in the development of gonads in vertebrates. It highlights the importance of these genes in controlling gene regulatory networks and specifying male gonadal primordium development. The study focuses on the medaka fish, a model organism for sex determination research, and identifies a cis-regulatory motif in the 3' UTR of dmrt1bY called D3U-box, which is involved in the stability of the mRNA in germ cells. The authors demonstrate that two RNA binding proteins, Oryzias latipes CUG-binding protein (Ol-cug-bp) and Oryzias latipes Bicoid Stability Factor (Ol-bsf), target the D3U-box motif and regulate the stability of dmrt1 mRNA. This regulation is crucial for gonadal development and maintenance, as well as the suppression of female networks. The study provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying sex determination and gonad development in vertebrates.  [E] This research paper delves into the intricate mechanisms governing gonad development in vertebrates, with a particular focus on the mab-3/doublesex/dmrt1 gene orthologs. These genes are highly conserved across metazoans and play a pivotal role in regulating gene networks that dictate the development and maintenance of male gonadal primordium. The study zeroes in on the medaka fish, a well-established model for sex determination studies, and uncovers a novel cis-regulatory 11-bp motif in the 3' UTR of dmrt1bY, termed the D3U-box. This motif is instrumental in conferring stability to the dmrt1bY mRNA in germ cells, an essential process for proper gonadal development. The paper further identifies and characterizes two RNA binding proteins, Ol-cug-bp and Ol-bsf, which antagonistically regulate the stability of dmrt1 mRNA through their interaction with the D3U-box. This discovery sheds light on the complex post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms that govern sex determination and gonad development in vertebrates and has broad implications for understanding the molecular underpinnings of these processes.
10.1371/journal.pntd.0006063	[L] The paper discusses how mosquitoes, which spread diseases like yellow fever, dengue, and malaria, lay their eggs in water. If the water dries up, the eggs can die before they hatch. However, some eggs can survive without water for a while due to a protective layer called the serosal cuticle. The researchers found that eggs with a darker color, which comes from a pigment called melanin, are better at staying viable without water. This could help mosquitoes to survive and spread diseases in different environments.  [E] The study investigates the role of eggshell melanization and the serosal cuticle in the desiccation resistance of mosquito eggs from Aedes, Anopheles, and Culex genera. The results show that eggs with higher melanization levels have better viability outside of water after the serosal cuticle has formed. This finding has implications for understanding mosquito ecology, evolution, and the management of vector-borne diseases.
10.1371/journal.pntd.0000265	[L] This study investigates the impact of parasitic worm infections, such as schistosomiasis, on the susceptibility to HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. The researchers found that helminth infection significantly increases the risk of acquiring HIV infection and viral replication in primates, suggesting that controlling parasitic worm infections may help reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS.  [E] The study evaluates the effect of Schistosoma mansoni infection on host susceptibility to immunodeficiency virus infection using schistosome-infected and control macaques exposed intrarectally to successively lower doses of the R5-tropic SHIV-C, SHIV-1157ipd3N4. The results show that helminth infection significantly increases host susceptibility to mucosal AIDS virus transmission in primates, and controlling helminth infections may be a public health intervention for individuals at risk for acquiring HIV-1.
10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006579	[L] This paper investigates how embryos develop consistently despite the random nature of cellular processes. The authors use computational modeling to study vertebrate somitogenesis, the formation of somites or body segments, in particular. They find that the segmentation clock, a regular pattern of gene expression, plays a crucial role in resisting noise and ensuring the consistent size of somites. The study proposes that the clock provides temporal information for somite formation and reduces spatial variability in gene activity, thus enhancing the reproducibility of developmental processes.  [E] The paper explores the mechanisms underlying the precision and reproducibility of embryonic development, focusing on vertebrate somitogenesis as a model system. The authors employ computational modeling to address the effects of intrinsic noise on developmental reproducibility and to investigate the role of the segmentation clock in reducing noise effects. They uncover a clock-independent mechanism for irregular somite formation and propose a novel concept of a clock-dependent mechanism for noise-resistant developmental reproducibility in somite formation. The study highlights the importance of the segmentation clock in providing temporal information for somite formation and in reducing ERK activity spatial heterogeneity against noise, revealing a previously unidentified role of the segmentation clock.
10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002201	[L] The research paper discusses the importance of protein dynamics in understanding the biological functions of proteins. The study focuses on the slow conformational dynamics of proteins, which is crucial for enzymes' catalytic turnover rates and allosteric regulation. The paper explores how the quaternary structure of oligomeric proteins, or proteins made up of multiple subunits, adds complexity to this dynamic code. The researchers used two classical models to interpret the conformational changes observed upon ligand binding. The study analyzes the effect of multimerization on protein dynamics, using the Amino Acid Kinase (AAK) family of enzymes as a case study. The results show that the oligomers maintain some intrinsic dynamic features of the monomeric units, while the different assembly geometries give rise to global motions uniquely defined for the particular oligomerization states. The study concludes that the architecture of the interfaces and the assembly geometry play an essential role in defining the most easily accessible modes of motion, which are relevant to the functional mechanisms of the different oligomers.  [E] The study investigates the dynamic behavior of proteins, with a particular focus on the slow conformational changes that occur in oligomeric proteins. It examines how these dynamics are influenced by the protein's three-dimensional structure and the assembly of its subunits. The research uses computational methods, specifically Elastic Network Models (ENMs) and Normal Mode Analysis (NMA), to determine the global modes of motion within these proteins. These methods are applied to the Amino Acid Kinase (AAK) family of enzymes, which display varying degrees of oligomerization. The findings reveal that the intrinsic dynamics of the monomeric units are preserved in the oligomeric state, and that the assembly geometry of these units can lead to unique collective motions. The paper emphasizes the role of protein-protein interfaces and the contact topology in mediating these dynamic events, which are crucial for the protein's function and allosteric regulation. The results underscore the importance of understanding protein dynamics for decoding the structure-function relationship in biological systems.
10.1371/journal.ppat.1001166	[L] The paper discusses the impact of rabies, a deadly disease that affects around 55,000 people annually, with over 99% of these fatalities occurring in developing countries. Rabies is primarily transmitted through dogs, yet little is known about how the virus spreads within these animal populations and its connection to human activities. By analyzing the genetic sequences of the rabies virus collected from dogs in North Africa, the researchers found that human infrastructure, such as roads, plays a significant role in the dispersal of the virus. This highlights the importance of understanding the movement of potentially infected animals in predicting the spread of viral infections and informs disease control strategies, especially in areas where human intervention is a key factor in the transmission of the virus.  [E] This study investigates the spatial and temporal dynamics of rabies virus (RABV) transmission in dog populations in North Africa, focusing on the role of human activities and landscape characteristics in RABV dispersal. The researchers used a Bayesian phylogeographic approach to analyze 287 RABV sequences sampled between 1986 and 2008 from Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, and Spanish territories in North Africa. They found that human infrastructure, particularly roads, significantly influences the spread of RABV in dog populations. The results suggest that human-mediated transmission plays a major role in the maintenance and spread of RABV in these regions, highlighting the need for timely intervention strategies and emphasizing the importance of understanding human-animal interactions in predicting and controlling the spread of zoonotic pathogens.
10.1371/journal.pntd.0003063	[L] Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease that causes millions of infections worldwide each year. Brazil, which has the highest number of dengue cases, is hosting the 2014 FIFA World Cup, raising concerns about the potential spread of the disease among the large number of visitors and players. To estimate the risk, researchers used historical data on dengue cases in the cities hosting the World Cup games and found that the risk for tourists and teams was low, with only a few cases expected. However, the risk varied across locations and was higher in some cities like Fortaleza and Brasilia.  [E] The study aimed to estimate the risk of dengue transmission among tourists and teams during the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil using historical dengue surveillance data from 2001 to 2013. The researchers estimated the risk separately for game cities and basecamp cities where the teams would reside. They used two methods, percentile rank and empirical Bayes models, to forecast the dengue incidence rates during the World Cup weeks. The results showed that the risk of dengue was low but varied across locations, with higher risk estimates for some cities like Fortaleza and Brasilia. The study highlights the importance of using historical data and different methodologies to estimate disease transmission risks during mass gatherings and can help inform preparedness and response measures.
10.1371/journal.pgen.1006474	[L] This paper discusses the growing issue of obesity and its related health problems, such as diabetes, which are becoming increasingly common in many countries. The authors explore a new approach to treating obesity by focusing on increasing energy expenditure rather than just reducing energy intake. They examine a type of cell called thermogenic adipocytes, which can burn fat, and how they can be used to treat or prevent obesity. The paper also delves into the process by which these fat-burning cells are formed from stem cells, and identifies several key factors that regulate this process. The authors hope that a better understanding of how these cells work could lead to more effective treatments for obesity and related metabolic disorders.  [E] This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the gene regulation networks involved in the development of thermogenic adipocytes, a type of cell that can burn fat and potentially treat obesity. The authors used advanced molecular and genetic techniques to profile the transcriptome and epigenome of cells at various stages of becoming thermogenic adipocytes. They identified several key factors, including the kinase PIM1 and transcription factors SIX1, RREB1, and SOX13, which are crucial for the differentiation and function of these cells. The study also sheds light on the chromatin remodeling process that occurs during the lineage commitment of brown adipocytes, proposing a model where pre-deposition of the histone mark H3K4me1 is essential for the expression of brown fat cell-specific genes. The findings of this study could pave the way for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for obesity and associated metabolic complications.
10.1371/journal.pntd.0003174	[L] Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a systemic fungal infection that mainly affects South America, causing high rates of morbidity and mortality. The gold standard for diagnosing PCM is the visualization of yeast cells or the isolation of the fungus, but this method can be slow and insensitive. Serological tests have been used since the 1970s for a faster and simpler diagnosis, but there is a lack of standardization between different centers. This study compared the performance of six medical mycology reference centers in Brazil and found inconsistencies in their results, which could lead to conflicting information about patient treatment. The study suggests that efforts should be made to improve the standardization of serological diagnosis for PCM, as well as for a newly discovered species, P. lutzii, which is also endemic in South America.  [E] This paper investigates the inconsistencies in the serological diagnosis of Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) among six medical mycology reference centers in Brazil. The study highlights the lack of standardization in serological tests and the potential for conflicting information regarding patient treatment. The results suggest that the type of antigen and technique used in the tests may be factors that influence the accuracy of the results. The study recommends efforts to improve the standardization of serological diagnosis for PCM and the newly discovered species, P. lutzii, as well as other endemic mycoses in South America.
10.1371/journal.pntd.0001355	[L] Hookworm-related cutaneous larva migrans (CLM) is a parasitic skin disease caused by the migration of animal hookworm larvae in the epidermis. It is frequent in impoverished rural and urban communities in hot climates, affecting up to 15% of children under 4 years old. The main symptom of CLM is severe itching, which can lead to sleep disturbance, bacterial superinfection, and psychosocial stress. A study was conducted in Manaus, North Brazil, to investigate the impairment of skin disease-associated life quality in patients with CLM. The study found that nearly all participants experienced a reduction in life quality due to CLM, with the severity of the infection and the number of affected body areas being positively correlated with the degree of life quality impairment. Treatment with ivermectin significantly improved skin disease-associated life quality within two weeks.  [E] Hookworm-related cutaneous larva migrans (CLM) is a parasitic skin disease resulting from the migration of animal hookworm larvae, such as Ancylostoma braziliense, A. caninum, or Uncinaria stenocephala, within the epidermis. This disease is prevalent in impoverished rural and urban communities in hot climates, with prevalence rates reaching 4% in the general population and 15% in children under four years old. The primary symptom of CLM is severe pruritus, leading to sleep disturbance, bacterial superinfection, and psychosocial stress. A study conducted in Manaus, North Brazil, aimed to investigate the impairment of skin disease-associated life quality in patients with CLM. The findings revealed that nearly all participants experienced a reduction in life quality due to CLM, with the severity of the infection and the number of affected body areas positively correlating with the degree of life quality impairment. Treatment with ivermectin significantly improved skin disease-associated life quality within two weeks, highlighting the importance of prompt treatment to prevent stressful psychosocial consequences and secondary morbidity.
10.1371/journal.pntd.0006333	[L] Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a tropical disease caused by the parasite Leishmania infantum and transmitted by the sand fly species Lutzomyia longipalpis. This study aimed to investigate the dispersal, population size, gonotrophic cycle duration, and survival of L. longipalpis in an endemic area of Brazil. The findings suggest that the sand fly population has a high daily survival rate, low dispersal, and loyalty behavior, indicating that control measures targeting the vector population could effectively reduce the transmission of VL.  [E] This paper presents an investigation into the ecological parameters of the Lutzomyia longipalpis complex, a vector species for visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in Latin America. The study was conducted in an endemic area of Brazil and involved the mark-release-recapture (MRR) method to estimate the population size, daily survival rate, gonotrophic cycle duration, and dispersal behavior of the sand fly population. The results indicate high daily survival rates for both male and female sand flies, low population dispersal, and evidence of loyalty behavior. The findings have implications for the development of effective control measures to reduce VL transmission, such as environmental management and the use of insecticide-treated collars or topical products for canine hosts.
10.1371/journal.ppat.1006472	[L] This paper discusses how certain harmful bacteria, called E. coli, can cause serious infections in humans. These bacteria attach themselves to the lining of the intestines and damage the protective barrier, leading to inflammation and other symptoms. The researchers found that the bacteria have a special system, called TTSS, which allows them to inject proteins into the host cells, and this system can be detected by the host cells, triggering a response. However, some bacteria have developed ways to block this response, allowing them to survive in the host without being attacked by the immune system.  [E] This study investigates the mechanisms by which enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) manipulate host intestinal epithelial cell functions to facilitate colonization and cause disease. The researchers discovered that EPEC and EHEC utilize a type three secretion system (TTSS) to translocate effector proteins into host cells, subverting host cell processes and promoting colonization. The expression of an active TTSS by EPEC was found to trigger NF-κB activation in host cells, a novel signaling pathway that may play a role in distinguishing commensal from pathogenic bacteria. The study also identified several EPEC effectors that inhibit NF-κB activation, suggesting their role in dampening the host inflammatory response and potentially allowing for long-term colonization.
10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006642	[L] The study focuses on the RNA recognition motif (RRM), a large family of proteins that bind to RNA and play a crucial role in regulating gene expression. The authors engineered a specific RRM domain from the human Rbfox protein to target a specific RNA sequence, called pre-miR21, which is involved in cancer development. They used molecular dynamics simulations to understand the structural dynamics of the protein-RNA interaction and predict how mutations could improve the specificity and binding affinity of the engineered RRM domain. The simulations provided insights into the protein-RNA interface and helped design a new mutant predicted to have higher affinity and selectivity for the target RNA. The study highlights the potential of using computational methods to design tools for regulating gene expression and provides a foundation for further experimental validation.  [E] The paper presents a computational study on the engineering of the RNA recognition motif (RRM) domain of the human Rbfox protein for improved specificity and affinity towards the oncogenic precursor miRNA 21 (pre-miR21). The authors used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the structural dynamics and key interactions at the protein-RNA interface at an atomic level of description. By engineering the conserved RRM domain of Rbfox, they created a quadruple mutant (Rbfox*) with increased binding affinity for pre-miR21 and pre-miR20b. The study employed various simulation techniques, including enhanced sampling methods, to explore the conformational space of the mutated complex and predict the effects of additional mutations on binding specificity. The accuracy of the simulations was established by comparing with available NMR data and the structure of the Rbfox•pre-miR20b complex. The results facilitated the design of a new mutant (S151T Rbfox*) with predicted higher affinity and selectivity for the pre-miR21 target RNA, providing valuable insights into the structural basis of protein-RNA interactions and their potential for gene regulation applications.
10.1371/journal.pntd.0006446	[L] Schistosomiasis is a disease caused by parasitic flatworms called schistosomes that infect over 240 million people in 74 developing countries. Currently, the only drug available to treat the disease is praziquantel. However, researchers are exploring other potential drug targets, such as the proteolytic enzymes (proteases) of schistosomes, which aid in the parasite's survival and interaction with the host. One such protease, called SmSP2, has been identified and characterized in this study. SmSP2 is found to process several host proteins involved in blood clotting, fibrinolysis, and blood pressure regulation, suggesting that it may interfere with important vascular hemostatic processes. Therefore, SmSP2 could be a potential target for new anti-schistosomal therapeutics.  [E] This paper presents a detailed biochemical and enzymatic characterization of SmSP2, a serine protease from Schistosoma mansoni, a parasite responsible for causing schistosomiasis. SmSP2 is the most abundantly expressed serine protease in the blood-dwelling stages of the parasite and is found in the tegument and excretory/secretory products (ESP) of adult worms. The study demonstrates that SmSP2 has a narrow substrate specificity, preferentially cleaving substrates with basic residues at the P1 position, and is capable of processing several physiologically important host proteins, including fibronectin, plasminogen, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), and kininogen, leading to the release of the vasodilatory peptide bradykinin and inactivation of the vasoconstrictory peptide vasopressin. These findings suggest that SmSP2 may play a role in modulating the host's vascular hemostatic processes to benefit the parasite during its residence and movement within the host's blood vessels. The study highlights SmSP2 as a potential target for novel anti-schistosomal therapeutics and provides a foundation for further research into the role of SmSP2 and its orthologs in host-parasite interactions.
10.1371/journal.ppat.1004702	[L] The paper discusses the role of a specific type of immune cell, called γδ T cells, in protecting mice from a virus called murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV). It shows that these cells are as effective as another type of immune cell, αβ T cells, in controlling the virus and protecting the mice. The study also found that the γδ T cells increased in number in the lungs and liver of the mice after infection, and that these cells did not need other immune cells to be protective. The results suggest that γδ T cells could be important for protecting against viruses like MCMV and could be used to develop new treatments for viral infections.  [E] The study investigated the protective capacity of γδ T cells against MCMV infection in a murine model. It demonstrated that γδ T cells were as competent as αβ T cells in controlling MCMV infection and protecting mice from death. The study also revealed that the protective function of γδ T cells was independent of other immune cells such as NK cells, B cells, and αβ T cells. The findings provide insights into the role of γδ T cells in antiviral immunity and suggest their potential as a novel target for immunotherapeutic protocols against viral infections, including human cytomegalovirus (HCMV).
10.1371/journal.ppat.1004336	[L] This paper discusses the importance of cysteine proteases in the life cycle of Plasmodium parasites, which cause malaria. The study focuses on the role of cysteine protease inhibitors (ICPs) in the development and invasion of the parasite. The researchers found that ICPs are crucial for the proper development of the parasite in the liver stage and for the invasion of mosquito salivary glands and mammalian hepatocytes. The study also highlights the potential of ICPs as targets for new anti-malarial strategies.  [E] This study investigates the role of cysteine proteases and their inhibitors (ICPs) in the life cycle of Plasmodium parasites, which are responsible for malaria. The research emphasizes the importance of cysteine proteases in various biological processes, such as hemoglobin degradation, protein trafficking, and host cell invasion. The study demonstrates that ICPs play a critical role in the development and invasion of the parasite, particularly during the liver stage and when entering mosquito salivary glands and mammalian hepatocytes. The findings suggest that targeting ICPs could be a promising strategy for the development of new anti-malarial treatments.
10.1371/journal.pgen.1003725	[L] The paper discusses the importance of controlling gene expression for the proper development of multicellular organisms. It focuses on the role of a specific type of protein called H2A.Z, which is a variant of a protein called histone that helps package DNA into a compact form. The researchers found that changes to a particular part of H2A.Z, known as the acidic patch, affected its ability to be incorporated into the DNA packaging and to regulate gene expression. This can have significant effects on the development of embryonic stem cells, which are cells that can develop into any type of cell in the body. The study provides insights into how changes to histone proteins can impact development and suggests that the acidic patch of H2A.Z is a key feature for controlling gene expression and cell differentiation.  [E] The study investigates the role of histone variant H2A.Z and its unique C-terminal acidic patch in the regulation of gene expression during embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation. The researchers generated an H2A.Z mutant (H2A.ZAP3) with altered acidic patch residues and observed that it resulted in improper differentiation of ESCs. The H2A.ZAP3 mutant showed reduced association with chromatin and increased dynamics, leading to changes in gene expression, particularly at bivalent genes, which are genes that can be either turned on or off. The study demonstrates that the unique acidic patch of H2A.Z is crucial for its proper incorporation into chromatin and regulation of gene expression during development. These findings provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying ESC differentiation and the essential role of histone variants in development and disease.
10.1371/journal.pgen.1002192	[L] The paper presents a method for studying the dynamics of mammalian stem cells and tissue using somatic microsatellite (MS) mutations to reconstruct cell lineage trees. This method is based on the idea that somatic mutations accumulated during normal cell divisions give each cell a unique genomic signature. The researchers used this method to analyze the intestinal epithelium in mice and confirmed known aspects of stem cell dynamics, such as monoclonal conversion and the absence of an immortal strand in stem cells. The study also revealed that the colon is constituted by a few distinct progenitors and that there is no evidence for bone marrow renewal of the intestinal epithelium during adulthood. The method has potential applications for studying stem cell dynamics in other tissues.  [E] The study developed a retrospective method utilizing somatic microsatellite (MS) mutations to reconstruct cell lineage trees in mammals. This approach is independent of specific stem cell markers and does not require generation of transgenic animals or sophisticated imaging modalities. The researchers applied this method to the intestinal epithelium in Mlh1−/− mice, which have a higher MS mutation rate, allowing for increased precision in cell lineage analysis. Their results validated known aspects of intestinal stem cell dynamics, such as monoclonal conversion and the absence of an immortal strand. Additionally, the study provided new insights into the colon's progenitors and the lack of bone marrow renewal in the intestinal epithelium during adulthood. This method has potential applications for studying stem cell dynamics in other tissues where specific markers are absent or low availability of stem cells exists.
10.1371/journal.ppat.1003872	[L] The paper discusses the use of a strategy called "kick and kill" to eradicate HIV, which involves inducing the expression of the virus in latently infected cells and then using a toxin to kill those cells. The researchers used a specific immunotoxin called 3B3-PE38 in combination with antiretroviral therapy (ART) in a mouse model and found that it significantly reduced the number of HIV RNA-producing cells. The study suggests that combining immunotoxins with ART could be an effective approach to eliminating persistent HIV infection.  [E] The study evaluates the in vivo efficacy of the "kick and kill" strategy for HIV eradication, using the immunotoxin 3B3-PE38 in combination with antiretroviral therapy (ART) in a BLT humanized mouse model. The results demonstrate that the immunotoxin treatment during ART significantly reduces the number of HIV RNA-producing cells in various tissues, suggesting that this approach may be effective in eliminating persistent HIV infection. The study provides a quantitative framework for evaluating interventions to destroy HIV-producing cells during therapy and highlights the potential of targeted cytotoxic therapies as critical components of an effective HIV eradication strategy.
10.1371/journal.pntd.0000360	[L] Dengue is a serious health problem in many tropical developing countries, caused by one of four types of dengue virus. There is no vaccine or specific treatment for dengue, so timely and accurate diagnosis is important to help manage the disease and prevent its spread. This study evaluated the effectiveness of two commercial tests that detect a protein called NS1, which is produced by dengue virus-infected cells. The tests were found to be specific tools for diagnosing acute dengue, but their sensitivity was influenced by the level of virus in the blood and the patient's immune response. The study highlights the importance of using multiple diagnostic approaches to increase the accuracy of dengue diagnosis.  [E] The study assessed the sensitivity and specificity of two commercial NS1 assays, the Platelia ELISA and a lateral flow rapid test (NS1-LFRT), in diagnosing dengue in Vietnamese patients. The assays were found to be specific for diagnosing acute dengue, but their sensitivity was influenced by the level of viraemia and host humoral immune response. The study also found that NS1 detection was more sensitive in primary dengue infections than in secondary dengue infections, and that NS1 detection was significantly reduced in DENV-2 infected patients. The findings suggest that NS1 detection via ELISA assay or LFRT, particularly in the first 3 days of illness, provides a reasonably sensitive and specific approach to dengue diagnosis in hospitalized patients using a single specimen. The study highlights the importance of using multiple diagnostic approaches to increase the accuracy of dengue diagnosis and provides insights into the prognostic value of early NS1 measurements for predicting patients at risk of developing severe complications.
10.1371/journal.pntd.0006159	[L] The paper investigates the reasons for low attendance at static point (SP) vaccination clinics for dogs in Blantyre, Malawi, which offer free rabies vaccinations. The study used data from a city-wide vaccination campaign, including dog-related and household-related factors, and found that distance from the SP, poverty levels, and dog signalment were significant factors influencing attendance. The study highlights the importance of understanding these barriers to improve future vaccination campaigns and achieve higher vaccination coverage.  [E] The paper presents a large-scale study on the barriers to attendance at SP vaccination clinics for dogs in an urban setting in sub-Saharan Africa. The study utilized data from a city-wide mass dog vaccination campaign in Blantyre, Malawi, and employed a multi-variable logistic regression model to investigate the influence of various factors on attendance at SP clinics. The findings suggest that distance from the SP, socio-economic status, and dog signalment play crucial roles in determining attendance, highlighting the need to address these factors in future vaccination campaigns to achieve higher coverage and eliminate rabies transmission.
10.1371/journal.pntd.0002649	[L] The paper discusses the transmission of African trypanosomes, a parasite causing diseases in humans and animals, through the bite of infected tsetse flies. Currently, there are no vaccines available, and drug treatments are expensive with adverse side effects. The study aims to better understand the biological processes underlying parasite transmission to develop new methods for disease control, potentially through interrupting the parasite's development in the insect host or its transmission to mammals. The researchers used an RNA sequencing approach to compare the transcriptome of the tsetse fly's salivary glands, both uninfected and infected with trypanosomes, to identify changes in gene expression and potential targets for intervention.  [E] The study investigates the interactions between the tsetse fly (Glossina morsitans) and the African trypanosomes (Trypanosoma brucei) responsible for causing Human and Animal African Trypanosomiasis (HAT and AAT). The absence of vaccines and the high cost and side effects of available drugs highlight the need for alternative disease control strategies. This research explores the potential of interrupting the parasite's life cycle at various stages as a novel approach to disease control. Through an RNA-sequencing analysis comparing the transcriptomes of uninfected and T. b. brucei-infected G. m. morsitans salivary glands, the study identifies differentially regulated genes that may play a critical role in parasite differentiation, development, and establishment in the mammalian host. The findings provide insights into host-parasite interactions and may pave the way for the development of transmission-blocking interventions.
10.1371/journal.pntd.0007643	[L] Leishmaniasis is a disease caused by parasites and is known as a Neglected Tropical Disease. There are different types of leishmaniasis, but the most serious one is called visceral leishmaniasis. It is caused by two types of Leishmania and affects many people, leading to a lot of deaths each year. The medicines we have now for treating leishmaniasis are not perfect because they can be toxic, expensive, and may not work against the parasites. So, scientists are trying to find new medicines by studying natural products from nature. They found some bacteria that live with ants and looked at the chemicals these bacteria make. They discovered four interesting chemicals that can help fight against the Leishmania parasites. These chemicals were able to control the growth of some fungi in the ants' environment and also showed good results against the parasites in the lab. This means that these chemicals could be a starting point for creating new medicines to treat leishmaniasis.  [E] The paper discusses the search for new antileishmanial compounds due to the limitations of current drugs used to treat visceral leishmaniasis, a severe form of the disease caused by Leishmania parasites. The authors explore the potential of natural products derived from understudied sources, specifically focusing on Streptomyces bacteria associated with fungus-growing ants. These ants have a unique relationship with actinobacteria that produce secondary metabolites to control the growth of a pathogenic fungus called Escovopsis. The researchers isolated several actinobacteria strains from the ants and identified four bioactive compounds with antifungal and antiprotozoal activities, which showed promising results against Leishmania donovani in vitro. The findings support the ecological approach of screening natural products from actinobacteria associated with attine ants as a viable strategy for discovering novel antileishmanial compounds.
10.1371/journal.pntd.0002526	[L] The paper discusses the challenges of controlling diseases caused by pathogens that can quickly adapt to environmental changes, such as drug resistance. It highlights the importance of understanding the population genetic dynamics of pathogens to develop effective risk assessment and intervention strategies. The study focuses on the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei, which causes Human African Trypanosomiasis or Sleeping Sickness, and examines the role of genetic exchange in different populations of the parasite. The researchers found that the population structure and the occurrence of genetic exchange vary between different geographical regions, which has implications for controlling the disease.  [E] The paper investigates the population genetic dynamics and evolutionary potential of pathogenic protozoan parasites, with a particular focus on Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of Human African Trypanosomiasis. The study examines the role of genetic exchange and recombination in shaping the population structure of T. brucei, and explores the implications of these findings for disease control and intervention strategies. The research reveals significant diversity in the population structure and reproductive strategies of T. brucei across different geographical regions, with evidence of both clonal and sexual reproduction. The findings underscore the complexity of pathogen evolution and adaptation, and highlight the need for a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing genetic exchange in order to develop effective strategies for managing and preventing the spread of diseases such as Sleeping Sickness.
10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002897	[L] Spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is a learning rule in the brain that adjusts the strength of connections between neurons based on the timing of their electrical signals. This paper investigates how STDP can lead to the selection of specific delays in a network receiving oscillatory inputs, and how this affects the network's response to different frequencies. The authors use mathematical models and simulations to show that the selected delays depend on the frequency of the inputs, and that the network can become selectively responsive to certain frequencies after learning. They also explore how this delay selection could be relevant to various brain processes, such as the formation of neuronal ensembles and the perception of sound.  [E] The study examines the role of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) in determining the structure of neuronal networks by selectively strengthening or weakening synaptic connections based on the relative timing of pre- and post-synaptic spikes. The authors use analytical and computational approaches to demonstrate that STDP can lead to the encoding of temporal correlations in neuronal activity, such as oscillations, into the functional structure of networks with axonal and dendritic propagation delays. They investigate the effects of oscillatory input on the strength of recurrent connections in a network and find that the resulting changes in network structure can lead to selective responses to specific oscillation frequencies. The study provides insights into the mechanisms underlying neural learning and memory, as well as the role of oscillatory activity in cognitive processes.
10.1371/journal.pntd.0006797	[L] Leishmaniasis is a disease caused by the parasite Leishmania infantum, which is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected sand flies. Dogs are the main source of infection for humans. This study uses a mathematical model to evaluate the effectiveness of using systemic insecticides in dogs as a strategy to reduce the transmission of Leishmania infantum to humans. The results suggest that community-wide use of systemic insecticides in dogs could significantly reduce the number of human infections, and provides guidance on the minimum requirements for developing such insecticides.  [E] The study presents a mathematical model to evaluate the potential impact of community-wide use of systemic insecticides in dogs as a vector control strategy to reduce the transmission of Leishmania infantum, the etiological agent of Zoonotic Visceral Leishmaniasis (ZVL) in humans and dogs. The model estimates the minimum requirements for the efficacy and duration of the insecticides and the coverage level needed to significantly reduce the number of human infections with L. infantum. The results indicate that systemic insecticides with an initial efficacy of at least 80%, effective for at least 6 months, could reduce the annual ZVL incidence by 50% if administered to at least 70% of the dogs in an endemic area. The study provides valuable insights into the potential of systemic insecticides as an alternative or complementary control strategy to current measures in ZVL-endemic regions, and highlights the need for further research to evaluate the cost-effectiveness and operational feasibility of this approach.
10.1371/journal.ppat.1000746	[L] Malaria is a serious disease that affects many people in tropical areas, causing sickness and sometimes death. It is caused by a parasite called Plasmodium, which enters human cells and multiplies. Currently, there are no good ways to stop the parasite from entering human cells, but scientists are trying to find new ways to prevent this. This study looks at the process of how the Plasmodium parasite gets into human cells and discovers that certain signals, like changes in calcium levels, trigger the release of proteins that help the parasite attach and enter the cells. The results provide a better understanding of how the parasite invades human cells and could help in developing new ways to fight malaria.  [E] Malaria is a significant global health issue, primarily caused by the Plasmodium falciparum parasite. The study focuses on understanding the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways involved in the invasion of human erythrocytes by Plasmodium merozoites, a critical step in the malaria infection process. The researchers investigate the role of intracellular calcium in the regulated secretion of apical organelles, such as micronemes and rhoptries, which contain proteins essential for host cell invasion. They identify specific external signals, such as low potassium ion concentrations, that trigger a rise in cytosolic calcium levels and the sequential release of microneme and rhoptry proteins. The findings contribute to the development of novel intervention strategies, including potential drug targets and effective vaccines to combat malaria.
10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005724	[L] The paper discusses how the abnormal structure of blood vessels in solid tumors affects the delivery of drugs, making it difficult for large drug particles to penetrate into the tumor. The authors suggest that using antiangiogenic agents, which can decrease vessel wall permeability and restore some normal function and structure of tumor vessels, may improve the delivery of drugs to the targeted tumor cells. The study shows that combining antiangiogenic therapy with chemotherapy can improve the efficacy of treatment for various cancers, but the dosing and scheduling of the combined therapy must be carefully tailored to maximize the benefits.  [E] The paper investigates the impact of tumor vasculature abnormalities on drug delivery in solid tumors, focusing on the role of interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) in hindering the penetration of large drug particles into the tumor. The authors propose that the application of antiangiogenic agents can decrease vessel wall permeability and restore some normal function and structure of abnormal tumor vessels, a process called vascular normalization. They demonstrate that normalization enhances convection of drug particles from vessels into tumor interstitium by restoring transvascular pressure gradients through IFP reduction. The study highlights the importance of carefully tailoring the dosing and scheduling of combined antiangiogenic and chemotherapy therapy to maximize drug delivery and therapeutic efficacy, and suggests that intermittent cycles of antiangiogenic agent scheduling may be beneficial. The paper also discusses the use of mathematical models to assess the impact of antiangiogenic therapy on drug delivery and suggests that targeted therapies may be better suited to take advantage of normalization benefits due to their ability to be applied in higher doses without harming healthy tissue.
10.1371/journal.ppat.1003291	[L] This paper investigates how the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) spreads within the body by using dendritic cells (DCs), which are immune cells that normally help fight infections. The study finds that HIV can attach to DCs using a specific molecule called CD169, which recognizes a sugar molecule called GM3 on the virus's surface. This interaction allows HIV to enter DCs and be passed on to other immune cells, called T cells, which the virus can then infect. The study also shows that certain conditions, such as the presence of a specific immune signal called type I interferon, can increase the expression of CD169 on DCs and enhance the virus's ability to spread. These findings suggest that targeting the interaction between CD169 and GM3 could be a potential strategy for blocking HIV transmission.  [E] This study elucidates a novel mechanism by which HIV-1 exploits the host's immune system for its dissemination. It demonstrates that the IFNα-inducible sialic-acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin (Siglec-1), CD169, acts as a receptor on myeloid dendritic cells for the attachment and transfer of HIV-1 particles in a GM3-dependent manner. The study reveals that type I interferon (IFN) enhances the expression of CD169 on dendritic cells, facilitating HIV-1 capture and subsequent trans infection of CD4+ T cells. This finding challenges the prevailing notion that DC-SIGN is the primary receptor for HIV-1 transmission via dendritic cells and highlights the potential of targeting the GM3-CD169 interaction as a novel therapeutic strategy for HIV-1 prevention.
10.1371/journal.pgen.1002246	[L] This paper investigates the role of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) in the development of vertebrate bones. The study focuses on two genes, fam20b and xylt1, which are involved in the synthesis of CSPGs. The researchers used zebrafish larvae as a model and identified mutations in these genes that lead to increased bone formation and decreased cartilage matrix. They found that these mutations cause chondrocytes (cartilage cells) to mature prematurely, leading to early formation of bone tissue. The results suggest that CSPGs are important in regulating the timing of bone development and that alterations in their synthesis can lead to skeletal disorders.  [E] This research paper provides an in-depth analysis of the role of CSPGs in endochondral ossification, a process responsible for the formation of chondral bones in vertebrates. The study utilized a forward genetic screen in zebrafish larvae to identify mutations in fam20b and xylt1, two genes critical for CSPG synthesis. The findings reveal that these mutations lead to precocious chondrocyte maturation and accelerated perichondral bone formation, demonstrating a negative regulatory role for CSPGs in skeletogenic timing. The results have implications for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying bone development and may provide insights into the etiology of skeletal disorders related to accelerated developmental timing, such as craniosynostoses.
10.1371/journal.pntd.0004574	[L] Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is a potentially deadly infectious disease caused by the SFTS virus (SFTSV), which is transmitted through tick bites. The disease was first identified in China in 2007, and since then, over 5,000 cases have been reported across 23 provinces. The virus can infect various animals and can also be transmitted vertically from adult ticks to their offspring. In this study, the researchers conducted a comprehensive survey in Jiangsu province to better understand the ecology of SFTSV in ticks and small wild animals. They found that the virus can be transmitted transovarially in the Haemaphysalis longicornis tick species and that small wild mammals, such as hedgehogs and shrews, may act as amplifying hosts for the virus. Additionally, the study suggests that migratory birds could potentially transmit the virus over long distances.  [E] In this paper, the authors investigate the ecology of the Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) in ticks and small wild animals in Jiangsu province, China. The study detected SFTSV RNA in unfed larvae of the Haemaphysalis longicornis tick species, indicating the possibility of vertical transmission of the virus. Small wild mammals, such as Erinaceus europaeus and Sorex araneus, were identified as potential amplifying hosts for SFTSV, with evidence of prolonged infection. Furthermore, the presence of viral antibodies in migratory bird species suggests that SFTSV could be transmitted over long distances via these birds. The findings provide valuable insights into the transmission dynamics of SFTSV and may inform strategies to prevent the spread of this emerging infectious disease.
10.1371/journal.ppat.1007708	[L] This paper investigates the impact of marine viruses on the ecosystem, focusing on how a specific virus affects the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi, a type of algae that plays a key role in carbon and sulfur cycles. The researchers used single-cell analysis to examine the infection dynamics and found that the virus can change the host's metabolism, leading to the production of unique lipids that are essential for viral assembly and infectivity. They also discovered that there is a phase of early host response before viral gene expression begins, which could represent a new type of anti-viral defense. The study highlights the importance of understanding host-virus interactions at a single-cell level in order to better comprehend the complex dynamics of marine ecosystems.  [E] This study explores the ecological and evolutionary role of marine viruses, particularly the impact of the Emiliania huxleyi virus (EhV) on the coccolithophore E. huxleyi, a significant primary producer in marine environments. By employing single-cell transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis, the researchers identified a distinct early host response phase prior to viral gene expression, characterized by the upregulation of host genes involved in metabolic pathways that are later exploited by the virus. The findings demonstrate the importance of single-cell resolution analyses for uncovering complex infection dynamics and suggest that understanding these interactions is crucial for elucidating the biogeochemical cycling of carbon and sulfur in marine ecosystems.
10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005793	[L] The paper explores how proteins in our body interact with each other and how these interactions can change in different situations like cancer. It discusses a principle called "guilt-by-association" which suggests that proteins involved in the same process tend to interact with each other. The researchers used this principle and a network of protein interactions to study how a gene's function can change in breast cancer compared to normal breast tissue. They found that many genes showed significant changes in their interactions in cancer, which could be linked to patient survival. This approach provides a new way to understand how genes function in different contexts and could help in finding new ways to treat diseases like cancer.  [E] The study leverages the protein interaction network (PIN) and the guilt-by-association principle to investigate the dynamic and context-specific functional changes of genes, particularly focusing on breast cancer. By employing a diffusion-based approach to functional assignment, the researchers were able to identify significant qualitative changes in the PIN neighborhood of genes in cancer relative to normal tissue. This led to the discovery of cancer-associated functions that were not detected using traditional methods based on gene expression alone. The findings suggest that alterations in the PIN may represent an alternative mechanism for functional changes in cancer and that these changes could be associated with patient survival risk. The study's methodology has potential applications in other diseases, development, and tissues, offering a complementary approach to understanding functional changes in various biological contexts.
10.1371/journal.ppat.1006419	[L] This study investigates the effects of re-exposure to different influenza A virus (IAV) subtypes in mallards, a natural host species. The researchers found that initial infection with a specific IAV subtype provided long-term protection against homologous re-infection for up to 15 weeks. Partial protection was also observed against heterologous subtypes, suggesting the development of heterosubtypic cross-immunity. The results indicate that immunity induced by pre-infection may reduce transmission potential in subsequent infections and promote the high degree of IAV antigenic diversity observed in wild avian populations.  [E] This experimental study examines the persistence of protection against homologous and heterologous IAV challenges in mallards following initial infection with H3N8 LPIAV, one of the most common subtypes in waterfowl. The findings reveal that long-term protection against homologous re-infection can last up to 15 weeks post-challenge, and partial protection against heterologous subtypes is achieved through the development of heterosubtypic cross-immunity. The results have implications for understanding the maintenance of IAV antigenic diversity in multi-strain/subtype-pathogen systems and the influence of population immunity on the emergence and spread of new strains in different host species.
10.1371/journal.pgen.1003892	[L] Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is a process that allows bacteria to exchange genetic material, which can lead to the spread of antibiotic resistance and disease. In this study, researchers investigated the regulation of plasmid conjugation, a specific type of HGT, in Bacillus subtilis, a common soil bacterium. They discovered a new regulatory mechanism involving three key components: a repressor protein (RcoLS20), an anti-repressor protein (RapLS20), and a signaling peptide (Phr*LS20). This mechanism helps control when and how often bacteria exchange genes, potentially influencing bacterial evolution and the spread of antibiotic resistance.  [E] This paper presents a detailed investigation into the regulatory mechanisms governing plasmid conjugation in Bacillus subtilis, a bacterium that plays a significant role in horizontal gene transfer (HGT). The authors identify an Xre-type repressor (RcoLS20) as the primary transcriptional regulator responsible for maintaining the conjugation system in an "OFF" state. They also describe a novel regulatory circuitry involving a Rap protein (RapLS20) and a signaling peptide (Phr*LS20) that controls the activation of conjugation genes. The study demonstrates that conjugation is not induced by recipient-produced pheromones, as seen in other bacterial systems, but is instead regulated by the interaction between RcoLS20, RapLS20, and Phr*LS20. This finding has implications for understanding bacterial evolution, the spread of antibiotic resistance, and the potential development of new strategies to control HGT.
10.1371/journal.pntd.0001385	[L] The dengue virus is a significant global health challenge, and the mosquito Aedes aegypti is the primary vector for its transmission. Currently, there are no effective vaccines or treatments, so understanding how the mosquito transmits the virus could help develop new control strategies. This study analyzed the gene expression patterns in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes that are either susceptible or refractory to dengue infection and identified several pathways and genes that may play a role in the mosquitoes' response to the virus. The findings could provide insights into the mosquito-virus interaction and help develop novel intervention strategies.  [E] The study investigated the global gene expression patterns in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes upon dengue virus infection and identified 2,454 dengue-responsive genes that interact in defined patterns distinguishing susceptible and refractory strains. The transcriptional network revealed complex defense mechanisms in the refractory phenotype and suggested several candidate pathways that may determine the compatible or non-compatible interaction between A. aegypti and dengue virus. The findings provide insights into the mosquito-virus interaction and could help develop novel genetic control strategies for dengue prevention.
10.1371/journal.pntd.0006750	[L] Loiasis is a parasitic infection found in West and Central Africa that can cause various symptoms and complications. A study investigated the impact of mass drug administration with ivermectin, a drug used to treat onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis, on the transmission of loiasis in Cameroon. The study found that repeated ivermectin treatment reduced the prevalence and intensity of loiasis infection, particularly in areas with high initial endemicity. However, adherence to treatment was low, with a significant proportion of the population refusing or not taking the drug regularly. This highlights the need for alternative strategies to eliminate onchocerciasis and loiasis in co-endemic areas.  [E] Loiasis, caused by the filarial parasite Loa loa, is endemic in rainforest areas of West and Central Africa. This study aimed to assess the impact of mass drug administration (MDA) with ivermectin, the drug of choice for onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis control, on loiasis transmission in Cameroon. The study found that repeated large-scale ivermectin treatment significantly reduced the prevalence and intensity of L. loa microfilaraemia, particularly in areas with high initial endemicity. However, adherence to treatment was suboptimal, with a significant proportion of the population being non-adherent or low compliers. This finding underscores the need for alternative strategies to achieve the elimination of onchocerciasis and loiasis in co-endemic areas, and highlights the importance of research and development for safe drugs to combat L. loa infection.
10.1371/journal.pgen.1000810	[L] The paper discusses the coordination between replication and transcription processes in cells, which can conflict with each other, especially when frequently initiated in rapidly growing cells. This conflict is resolved in part by the orientation of certain genes, such as those for ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and transfer RNA (tRNA), which are usually transcribed in the same direction as they are replicated. The study focuses on Bacillus subtilis, a bacterium, and finds that when the usual orientation is reversed, it can lead to slower replication, stalling of replication forks, and increased mutation rates. These effects are more pronounced under certain conditions, such as when cells are grown in a rich medium. The findings suggest that maintaining the integrity of the genome has contributed to the evolution of the gene orientation bias observed in many organisms.  [E] The study investigates the impact of transcription-replication conflicts on genome integrity and cellular fitness in Bacillus subtilis. It reveals that inversion of transcription bias over a significant portion of the chromosome leads to slowed replication, particularly at highly-transcribed rRNA operons. This stalling is enhanced under nutrient-rich conditions and can result in replication fork disruption, activation of DNA damage responses, and increased cell death. The findings support the hypothesis that avoidance of transcription-replication conflicts has driven the evolution of co-orientation bias in genomes, and suggest that the costs associated with such conflicts can vary depending on growth conditions and the specific genes involved.
10.1371/journal.ppat.1005931	[L] Schistosomiasis is a major parasitic disease affecting humans, causing significant morbidity and mortality, particularly in Africa. Understanding the biology of the parasite and its interaction with the human host is crucial for developing effective interventions. This study investigates the use of lentiviral vectors, such as HIV-1, to manipulate the genome of the parasitic flatworm Schistosoma mansoni, which causes schistosomiasis. The researchers found that HIV-1 can successfully integrate its genetic material into the chromosomes of S. mansoni, paving the way for new functional genomics approaches to study the parasite and potentially develop novel control strategies.  [E] This paper reports on the successful integration of HIV-1 provirus into the genome of Schistosoma mansoni, a parasitic flatworm responsible for schistosomiasis, a major neglected tropical disease. The study demonstrates that lentiviral vectors, such as HIV-1, can efficiently transduce S. mansoni, leading to attachment of virions, reverse transcription, and integration into the parasite's genome. This breakthrough provides a new avenue for functional genomics research on schistosomes and related parasites, enabling the development of novel intervention strategies and a deeper understanding of the biology and pathogenesis of these organisms.
10.1371/journal.pntd.0003280	[L] Leptospirosis is a widespread disease caused by bacteria called Leptospira, which is found in the urine of infected animals like rats. These bacteria can spread through water or direct contact with the urine, leading to symptoms like fever, headaches, and muscle pain in humans. The current study looks at how Leptospira bacteria can change their surface proteins to help them survive inside animals and potentially avoid the human immune system. The researchers found that some of these proteins had added chemical groups, like methyl groups, which might help the bacteria hide from the immune system and cause more severe disease. This could help explain why Leptospira can persist in the environment and infect humans, and may lead to new ways to prevent or treat the disease.  [E] The paper investigates the presence of post-translational modifications (PTMs), specifically methylations, in the major leptospiral lipoprotein LipL32, which is found in pathogenic Leptospira species. The study compares LipL32 from leptospires isolated from rat urine (in vivo) with those cultured in vitro. The researchers identified several lysine residues in LipL32 that were modified with methyl or acetyl groups exclusively in the in vivo-derived leptospires. These modifications were found in regions of LipL32 that have been previously identified as immunogenic, and modification of one such epitope (K152) was shown to significantly decrease reactivity with human leptospirosis serum. The results suggest that PTMs of LipL32 may play a role in immune evasion and persistence of Leptospira in mammalian hosts, potentially contributing to the chronic nature of leptospirosis in rats and acute infection in humans. The study provides a novel insight into the functional consequences of PTMs in LipL32 and highlights the need for further research into their role in Leptospira pathogenesis and immune evasion.
10.1371/journal.ppat.1006782	[L] The study explores how the immune system can handle multiple infections and the impact they have on the body's memory of past infections. The researchers found that the immune system can accommodate several memory T cell populations from different infections without negatively affecting the existing ones. However, certain infections, like cytomegalovirus (CMV), can reduce the number of these memory cells, which may influence the body's ability to fight off new infections. The findings suggest that the timing of acquiring infections during a person's lifetime can significantly affect their immune response to future infections.  [E] The research investigates the capacity of the immune system to maintain multiple inflating and central memory T cell pools from unrelated pathogens, as well as the potential impact of new infections on pre-existing memory T cell populations. The study demonstrates that the immune system can support the development of multiple inflating and central memory responses against two unrelated infections simultaneously. However, certain infections, such as murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV), can cause a rapid depletion of pre-existing inflating memory T cells, which may have implications for the host's ability to respond to new, unrelated pathogens. The findings indicate that the order in which pathogens are encountered during a host's lifetime can have a profound impact on long-term CD8 T cell effector memory immune responses.
10.1371/journal.pgen.1004098	[L] The paper explores the development of sexual dimorphism in animals, particularly the growth of exaggerated traits like the horns of beetles. The researchers focused on the role of a protein called Doublesex (Dsx) in regulating sexual differentiation and how it interacts with nutrition and hormones. They studied the stag beetle Cyclommatus metallifer and found that Dsx is responsible for the sex-specific growth of mandibles. By manipulating Dsx levels and applying a hormone analog, they showed that Dsx controls the sensitivity of mandibular growth to hormones in a sex-specific manner. This research provides insights into the mechanisms behind the development of sexually dimorphic traits in insects.  [E] The study investigates the developmental mechanisms underlying sex-specific mandible growth in the stag beetle Cyclommatus metallifer, focusing on the function of the Doublesex (Dsx) gene and its interaction with juvenile hormone (JH) signaling. The researchers identified four distinct splice variants of the C. metallifer Dsx gene (Cmdsx) and demonstrated their sex-specific expression during prepupal development. RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown of Cmdsx resulted in altered mandible growth and morphology in both males and females, indicating a crucial role for Dsx in regulating sexual dimorphism. Additionally, the study revealed that Cmdsx knockdown animals had significantly altered responses to JH analog application, suggesting a functional link between Dsx expression and JH signaling in the regulation of sexually dimorphic traits. The findings provide valuable insights into the complex interplay between endocrine and sex-determination pathways in the development of exaggerated sexually-selected and sexually-dimorphic characters in insects.
10.1371/journal.pgen.1006033	[L] The paper investigates the role of a gene called Regulator of calcineurin 1 (RCAN1) in the development of Type 2 diabetes (T2D), a condition characterized by high blood sugar levels due to the body's reduced ability to use insulin effectively. The study found that RCAN1 is overexpressed in the pancreas cells of people with T2D, leading to reduced insulin secretion and increased blood sugar. The researchers believe that this overexpression is linked to increased levels of a type of cellular stress known as oxidative stress, which can damage these pancreas cells and affect their ability to produce insulin. The findings suggest that targeting RCAN1 could be a potential strategy for treating T2D. [E] This research paper presents a comprehensive study on the implications of RCAN1 overexpression in the pathogenesis of Type 2 diabetes (T2D), focusing on its impact on pancreatic β-cell function and insulin secretion. The study leverages both human islet gene expression data and various mouse models to identify RCAN1 as a critical gene contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction and reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in T2D. The findings reveal that increased RCAN1 expression correlates with hyperglycemia, impaired glucose tolerance, and reduced ATP production in β-cells, which are key factors in the progression of T2D. The paper also discusses the potential epigenetic regulation of RCAN1 through DNA methylation changes in T2D islets, providing a novel mechanistic insight into the regulation of this gene in β-cell dysfunction. The results underscore the importance of RCAN1 as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of T2D and offer a foundation for further exploration into the complex interplay between genetic factors, mitochondrial function, and metabolic dysregulation in diabetes pathogenesis.
10.1371/journal.pntd.0006182	[L] The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) helps to organize and name different types of viruses. One type of virus called lyssaviruses, which includes the rabies virus, can be difficult to classify because there are many different versions of it. Scientists have used a method called "affinity propagation" to group these viruses into clusters based on their genetic information. This method is helpful because it is less subjective and can be more easily applied to a large number of viruses. The study found that rabies virus can be divided into four main clusters, and that this method can also be used to help classify other types of lyssaviruses.  [E] The paper discusses the challenges in classifying lyssaviruses, a genus of negative sense RNA viruses, due to the high genetic diversity and lack of standardized definitions for genetic grouping. The authors propose the use of affinity propagation (AP) clustering, a non-hierarchical mathematical method, to objectively define clusters based on full genome sequences of rabies virus (RABV). The study analyzed 562 full genome RABV sequences, including 46 newly obtained, and identified four main clusters based on geographic distribution. The results were compared with classical phylogenetic analyses and found to be concordant, with the addition of improved transparency and computational efficiency using the AP method. The authors suggest that combining AP clustering with phylogenetic analyses can provide a more robust and transparent approach to sub-species demarcation for RABV and potentially other virus species. The study highlights the importance of using full genome sequences and detailed metadata to improve the accuracy of viral classification.
10.1371/journal.pgen.1003907	[L] The paper discusses the role of a protein called Sox10 in the development of myelin, a substance that insulates nerves and allows for rapid transmission of electrical signals in the nervous system. The study focuses on the production of myelin in the central and peripheral nervous systems by specialized cells, and how Sox10 controls this process. The researchers found that Sox10 is crucial for the induction of another protein, Myrf, which is also important for myelination. The study provides insights into the regulatory network that controls myelin production and highlights the similarities and differences between the central and peripheral nervous systems in vertebrates.  [E] The research paper investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying myelin formation in vertebrates, focusing on the transcription factor Sox10 and its role in oligodendrocyte and Schwann cell differentiation. The study demonstrates that Sox10 is essential for the induction of Myrf, a critical regulator of oligodendrocyte myelination in the central nervous system. The authors identify a conserved intronic enhancer element within the Myrf gene, ECR9, which is responsive to Sox10 and functions as a direct target gene. The findings reveal a key circuit in the myelin-specific regulatory network and provide insights into the convergent evolution of gene regulatory networks in vertebrate glial cells, emphasizing the functional similarities and differences between oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells.
10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006593	[L] The paper discusses the role of dendritic trees in collecting inputs from other neurons in the brain. It highlights that while different cell types have distinct roles, there is no reliable branching statistic that associates individual morphologies to their specific cell class. The paper introduces a new branching statistic, the regularity index R, which measures the degree of clustering of points in a given volume. The study uses this index to estimate the regularity of spatial input distributions and the respective dendritic morphology, finding that it can distinguish between different cell classes and provide new insights into the relationship between dendritic tree structure and input architecture.  [E] The paper presents a new morphological measure for dendrites, the regularity index R, based on the average nearest neighbor distance between branch and termination points of a dendritic tree. The authors demonstrate that R can distinguish dendritic trees from different cell classes and is weakly correlated with other commonly used branching statistics, indicating its potential as an additional measure for classifying dendritic morphology. The study also explores the relationship between R and the underlying connectivity of neurons using morphological models and finds that R can predict the regularity of a neuron's synaptic input organization. The authors propose that the regularity index R could be a useful addition to existing branching statistics and could provide valuable insights for connectome and neural circuit analyses.
10.1371/journal.ppat.1007957	[L] Zinc is an important mineral that helps support our immune system and protect us against bacterial infections like pneumonia. However, a lack of zinc in our diet can make us more vulnerable to these infections. This study looks at how zinc affects our body's ability to fight off a type of bacteria called Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is a common cause of pneumonia. The researchers used mice to show that when zinc levels are low, the bacteria can grow more easily and the mice have a harder time clearing the infection. They also found that zinc helps immune cells called phagocytes to kill the bacteria. The study suggests that making sure we have enough zinc in our diet is important to help our immune system work properly and protect us against bacterial infections.  [E] This paper investigates the role of dietary zinc in susceptibility to pneumococcal infection, caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. The study demonstrates that dietary zinc restriction leads to increased bacterial burden and reduced survival time in a murine model of pneumococcal infection. The authors show that host zinc status directly impacts pneumococcal zinc homeostasis, leading to increased bacterial proliferation in zinc-restricted environments. Furthermore, the study reveals that zinc contributes to antimicrobial control within the lung during pneumococcal infection and that zinc supplementation enhances the efficacy of phagocytic cells in killing the bacteria. The findings highlight the importance of dietary zinc sufficiency as a critical component of population-wide resistance against pneumococcal disease.
10.1371/journal.pgen.1006224	[L] This paper examines the role of promoter regions in gene transcription and highlights the prevalence of divergent and convergent transcription, where additional transcription events occur upstream or downstream of a gene promoter. The study identifies specific features associated with these types of transcription in human T47D/A1-2 cells, such as the positioning of transcription start sites and the presence of nucleosomes and histone marks. While convergent transcription has been considered repressive, the findings suggest that it does not necessarily correlate with lower gene expression levels and may instead be involved in the regulation of gene expression through its interaction with other promoter-associated features.  [E] The study investigates the genetic and epigenetic features of downstream antisense transcription start sites (daTSSs) associated with promoter-proximal convergent transcription in human T47D/A1-2 cells. It identifies daTSSs and examines their relationship with promoter-associated features, such as nucleosome positioning, histone modifications, and the binding of transcription factors and chromatin remodelers. The findings indicate that daTSSs are common in mammalian promoters and coincide with the downstream edge of promoter-associated chromatin features. While convergent transcription has been suggested as a repressive feature, the results show no significant association between daTSSs and lower gene expression levels in T47D/A1-2 cells. Instead, the coincidence of daTSSs with various transregulatory factors suggests a connection between antisense transcription and gene regulation.
10.1371/journal.pntd.0001147	[L] Dengue virus is a mosquito-borne infection that affects millions of people worldwide and can cause severe illness and even death. Currently, laboratory tests are used to diagnose dengue, but these can be expensive and time-consuming. A new study has found that detecting a specific protein produced by the virus, called NS1, in tissue samples can be an effective way to diagnose dengue in fatal cases. The study evaluated three different tests for detecting NS1 and found that one of the tests was able to identify the protein in over 90% of tissue samples from dengue victims. The results suggest that this approach could be a valuable tool for diagnosing dengue in cases where laboratory tests are not available or practical.  [E] This study evaluated the use of NS1 antigen capture tests, including Early ELISA, Platelia NS1, and NS1 Ag Strip, for the detection of dengue virus in human tissue specimens from fatal cases. The study found that the NS1 Ag Strip was the most sensitive test, detecting the antigen in 91.3% of tissue samples, while the Early ELISA and Platelia NS1 tests had lower sensitivities of 34.7% and 60.8%, respectively. The study also found that the NS1 antigen capture tests had 100% specificity and did not show cross-reactivity with tissues from yellow fever fatal cases. These results suggest that NS1 antigen capture tests, particularly the NS1 Ag Strip, may be a valuable tool for postmortem diagnosis of dengue virus infection and for understanding viral tropism in fatal cases. However, further studies are needed to confirm the specificity of this approach and to evaluate its effectiveness in clinical/pathological diagnosis of dengue.
10.1371/journal.pmed.1002645	[L] A recent study explored the use of crowdsourcing to increase HIV testing rates among men who have sex with men (MSM) in China. The researchers developed a multimedia campaign and an online HIV testing service using crowdsourcing, and implemented a stepped wedge cluster randomized controlled trial to evaluate the intervention's effectiveness. The results showed an increase in HIV testing rates during the intervention period, particularly for HIV self-testing. The study highlights the potential of crowdsourcing as a cost-effective and scalable tool for developing community-driven HIV testing services in low- and middle-income countries.  [E] This paper presents a stepped wedge cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating a comprehensive crowdsourced intervention to increase HIV testing uptake among MSM in China. The intervention included a multimedia HIV testing campaign, an online HIV testing service, and local testing promotion campaigns tailored for MSM, all developed using crowdsourcing. The study was conducted in eight Chinese cities and found that the crowdsourced intervention effectively increased HIV testing rates, particularly for HIV self-testing. The findings suggest that crowdsourcing can be a valuable tool for developing community-driven HIV testing services in low- and middle-income countries, with the potential for scalability and cost-effectiveness.
10.1371/journal.ppat.1007658	[L] The paper discusses how the owl monkey cytomegalovirus (OMCMV) has developed a strategy to evade the immune system by producing a protein called A43. This protein acts as a decoy, binding to a key immune cell receptor called 2B4, and preventing it from interacting with another protein, CD48, on the surface of infected cells. This interaction is crucial for the immune system to recognize and destroy infected cells. The study found that A43 is released from infected cells soon after infection and can bind to both owl monkey and human 2B4, impairing the ability of immune cells to function properly and control viral infection.  [E] The research paper presents an in-depth functional analysis of the OMCMV encoded CD48 homolog A43, revealing its role as a soluble decoy receptor that interferes with 2B4-mediated NK cell cytotoxic responses. The study demonstrates that A43 is an immediate early gene product that is released from infected cells and binds to host and human 2B4 with high affinity. This interaction inhibits NK cell adhesion, conjugate formation, and the establishment of the mature immunological synapse, ultimately reducing NK cell cytotoxicity and IFN-γ production. The findings highlight the viral strategy to evade the immune response through the direct blockade of a key activating receptor on NK cells and suggest potential therapeutic applications of A43 in modulating aberrant immune responses.
10.1371/journal.pbio.1002605	[L] The research paper focuses on the importance of myelin membrane integrity for the proper functioning of the nervous system. Myelin, a specialized membrane organelle, is synthesized by specific cells in the nervous system and has a high lipid-to-protein ratio, making it vulnerable to lipid metabolism disorders. The study investigates the role of astrocytes, a type of glial cell, in providing lipids for myelination. The researchers found that compromised lipid metabolism in oligodendrocytes, another type of glial cell, leads to a delay in myelin synthesis, which can be compensated by an increased uptake of fatty acids from external sources. Furthermore, they discovered that astrocytes play a crucial role in providing lipids for myelination, particularly during later stages of myelination. The study concludes that proper myelin membrane synthesis depends not only on the endogenous lipid synthesis of oligodendrocytes but also on the lipids provided by astrocytes.  [E] The research paper investigates the individual roles of oligodendrocyte and astrocyte lipid metabolism in central nervous system (CNS) myelination. It was found that myelin membrane formation relies not only on oligodendrocyte endogenous lipid synthesis but also critically depends on extracellular lipids provided by astrocytes. The study demonstrates that compromised lipid metabolism in oligodendrocytes leads to a severe developmental delay in myelin synthesis, which can be largely improved by increasing the uptake of fatty acids from external sources. Moreover, the study shows that compromised astrocyte lipid metabolism limits myelin membrane synthesis, causing persistent CNS hypomyelination. The findings suggest that CNS myelin membrane synthesis requires both endogenous oligodendrocyte lipid synthesis and extracellular lipids provided by astrocytes, and that a high-fat diet can rescue hypomyelination in astrocyte-lipid mutants. The results have important implications for understanding and treating myelin diseases.
10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003847	[L] The paper discusses the challenge of predicting protein structures from their amino acid sequences. Despite many years of research, this problem, which is crucial for understanding cellular mechanisms, remains unsolved. However, recent advances in sequencing technologies and methods for detecting sequence homology have led to the construction of accurate multiple sequence alignments, which capture the evolutionary history of proteins. The authors propose a new approach to predict protein structures by using co-evolutionary information from these alignments. Their method, called Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA), models the data set as a whole to identify direct and indirect couplings between residues. They introduce a new algorithm, gplmDCA, which includes information about gaps in the sequence alignments and improves the accuracy of contact predictions, a key step in determining protein structures.  [E] The research paper addresses the longstanding problem in bioinformatics of protein structure prediction from sequence information. It highlights the importance of the three-dimensional arrangement of proteins, which is dictated by their amino acid sequence. The authors propose an advancement in Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA), a method that uses co-evolutionary signals from multiple sequence alignments to predict protein structures. They introduce a novel algorithm, gap-enhanced pseudo maximum-likelihood direct contact analysis (gplmDCA), which incorporates gap information into the model, thereby improving the accuracy of contact predictions. This method outperforms existing algorithms, demonstrating its potential for future protein structure prediction efforts. The paper also discusses the impact of input data quality and the evolutionary pressure to conserve structure on the performance of DCA methods.
10.1371/journal.pntd.0002076	[L] The Hantaan virus (HTNV) is a type of virus that can cause a severe disease in humans, and it's spread through rodents. This study aimed to better understand how the human immune system responds to HTNV infection, specifically focusing on the role of certain immune cells called CD8+ T cells. The researchers identified five new regions of the virus that these immune cells can recognize and respond to, and found that the strength of this response is related to the severity of the disease. The results could help in developing better tests and treatments for HTNV infection, as well as inform the design of vaccines.  [E] This study investigated the HTNV-specific CD8+ T-cell responses in patients with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), a severe disease caused by HTNV. The researchers identified five novel HTNV nucleoprotein (NP) epitopes restricted by major HLA class I alleles in the Chinese Han population. They quantified the HTNV epitope-specific IFN-γ-secreting CD8+ T cells in HFRS patients and analyzed the kinetics, activation, and proliferation capacity of these cells. The results showed an inverse association between the magnitude of the epitope-specific CD8+ T-cell responses in the acute stage and the severity degree of HFRS, indicating the importance of these immune responses for virus clearance and disease control. The study provides new insights into the relationship between single epitope-specific CD8+ T-cell responses, CD8+ T-cell functional characters, and disease outcomes in acute zoonotic HTNV infections in humans.
10.1371/journal.pntd.0006060	[L] Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), also known as sleeping sickness, is a parasitic disease prevalent in Western and Central Africa. The disease is transmitted through the bite of the tsetse fly and can be fatal if left untreated. Recently, the Ebola virus disease epidemic in Guinea has impacted the control and treatment of HAT. This study investigates the effects of the Ebola outbreak on HAT screening and caring activities in three coastal areas of Guinea. The results show that the Ebola outbreak led to a significant reduction in HAT screening activities and an increase in the number of patients diagnosed at a late stage of the disease. The study emphasizes the need for increased awareness and active screening campaigns to control HAT and prevent a possible increase in disease prevalence in the future.  [E] The study examines the impact of the Ebola virus disease outbreak on human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) control activities in three coastal districts of Guinea, namely Boffa, Dubreka, and Forecariah. The retrospective analysis of data from the Guinean national HAT control program reveals a significant decrease in HAT screening activities, with active screening campaigns being abandoned during the Ebola outbreak and a reduction in passive screening activities at healthcare centers. The study also reports an increase in the proportion of patients diagnosed at a late stage of the disease and a decrease in post-treatment follow-up attendance. The results suggest that the Ebola outbreak has contributed to an increase in the burden of HAT in Guinea, with an increase in Disability Adjusted Life-Years (DALYs) from 48.7 before the outbreak to up to 466.3 during the outbreak, depending on the case fatality rate among under-reported HAT cases. The study highlights the need for increased awareness efforts, revival of passive surveillance systems, and large-scale active screening campaigns to control HAT and prevent a potential increase in disease prevalence in the future. The study also emphasizes the importance of implementing "less vulnerable" strategies, such as vector control, and reinforcing active screening campaigns to reduce transmission and human reservoir of HAT.
10.1371/journal.pgen.0040028	[L] The study investigates the genetic factors contributing to schizophrenia, a common psychiatric disorder with unknown causes. It focuses on the role of sex differences in the risk of developing the disorder and conducts a genome-wide association study using DNA samples from male and female participants. The researchers identify a specific genetic variant in the reelin gene (RELN) that is associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia in women, but not men. This finding supports the idea that sex hormones may play a role in the development of schizophrenia and highlights the importance of considering sex differences in genetic studies.  [E] This paper presents a genome-wide association study aimed at identifying sex-specific genetic risk factors for schizophrenia, a complex psychiatric disorder with a reported 80% heritability. The study independently analyzes DNA pools for men and women, employing a cost-effective approach to detect promising loci. A significant association is found between a specific SNP (rs7341475) in the reelin gene (RELN) and an increased risk of schizophrenia in women, but not men. This female-specific association is replicated across different populations, providing evidence for a potential role of sex hormones in modulating RELN gene expression and cortical structure, ultimately affecting susceptibility to psychosis. The findings underscore the importance of sex-specific genetic association studies and contribute to the understanding of the molecular basis of sex differences in schizophrenia risk.
10.1371/journal.ppat.1002592	[L] The human mouth is home to many types of microorganisms, including a fungus called Candida albicans. While usually harmless, this fungus can cause infections in the mouth, known as oral candidiasis, particularly in people with weakened immune systems like those with HIV. This study aimed to identify genes in Candida albicans that are linked to causing oral infections. The researchers discovered one gene, called DUR31, which plays a crucial role in the fungus's ability to damage cells in the mouth and its resistance to the body's immune system. The findings may help in developing new ways to treat and prevent oral candidiasis.  [E] This paper investigates the role of the C. albicans DUR31 gene in the pathogenesis of oral candidiasis, a common infection in immunocompromised individuals. The study identifies DUR31 as a key virulence factor involved in mediating adhesion, invasion, and damage to oral and endothelial host cells, as well as resistance to the immune response. Furthermore, DUR31 was found to contribute to the fungus's ability to alkalinize its environment, inducing hyphal formation, which is associated with its invasive properties. The findings provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying C. albicans pathogenesis and may have implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to combat oral candidiasis.
10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004696	[L] The paper discusses the complex process of how certain immune cells in the body, called B cells, mature and develop into different types that help fight infections. It explains that B cells go through various stages of development, influenced by signals from other cells and molecules in the body. The researchers used a computer model to understand how these signals interact and control the development of B cells, and their model suggested some new interactions that haven't been discovered yet. This model could help in understanding how B cells work and in developing treatments for diseases that affect the immune system.  [E] The study presents a computational model of the regulatory network controlling the terminal differentiation of B cells, a type of white blood cell crucial for adaptive immunity. The authors inferred the network from experimental data and used Boolean logic and continuous dynamical systems to simulate the behavior of B cells as they progress from naive precursors to germinal centers, memory cells, and plasma cells. The model successfully reproduces the known differentiation pathways and identifies potential regulatory interactions not previously characterized experimentally. The authors suggest that their model could be used to investigate the mechanisms underlying B cell differentiation and to explore therapeutic strategies for diseases involving B cell dysregulation.
