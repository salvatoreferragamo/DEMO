10.1371/journal.pgen.1003250	[L] This paper discusses the role of epigenetic mechanisms in controlling gene expression and cellular phenotypes. It focuses on the methylation of cytosine bases in DNA and the modification of histone proteins, which are important factors in epigenetic control. The researchers studied a mouse model of intestinal cancer and found specific patterns of DNA methylation that are characteristic of the disease. They also compared these patterns to human colon cancer samples and found similarities, suggesting that the findings could be relevant to human cancer as well. The study provides insights into the early stages of epigenetic modifications in cancer and could lead to the development of new diagnostic markers for early detection of the disease.[E] This paper explores the role of epigenetic mechanisms in regulating gene expression and cellular phenotypes, focusing on the methylation of cytosine bases in DNA and the modification of histone proteins. Using a mouse model of intestinal cancer, the researchers identified specific patterns of DNA methylation that occur early in the development of tumors. These patterns were found to be similar to those observed in human colon cancer, suggesting a conserved epigenetic signature between mice and humans. The study sheds light on the early steps of epigenetic modifications in cancer and provides a potential avenue for the development of diagnostic markers for early detection of the disease.
10.1371/journal.pntd.0003816	[L] Chagas disease is caused by a parasite called Trypanosoma cruzi and can range from a mild to severe form, affecting the heart in about 30% of infected individuals. The exact reasons for this variation are unclear, but factors such as the immune response, genetic differences in the host and the parasite's genetic diversity may play a role. In this study, the researchers compared two different strains of T. cruzi and their effects on human immune cells. They found that the strains led to different activation of immune cells, with one strain inducing a more balanced response and the other causing a more inflammatory response. This suggests that the genetic makeup of the parasite can influence the progression and outcome of Chagas disease.[E] Chagas disease, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a complex disease with varying clinical manifestations. In this study, the researchers investigated the immune response of human monocytes and lymphocytes to infection with two strains of T. cruzi: Y strain (Tc II) and Col cl1.7 (Tc I). They found that monocytes infected with either strain displayed higher expression of activation molecules and cytokines compared to non-infected monocytes. Interestingly, infection with Col cl1.7 led to a more balanced immune response, with higher expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, while infection with Y strain led to a more intense inflammatory profile, with higher expression of TNF-alpha and Granzyme A. Additionally, infected lymphocytes showed increased activation and cytokine expression. These findings suggest that the genetic diversity of T. cruzi strains can influence the immune response and potentially contribute to different disease outcomes in Chagas disease.
10.1371/journal.pgen.1006818	[L] This paper discusses the role of a DNA polymerase called pol ν in mammalian cells. The researchers found that pol ν is not essential for embryonic development or viability in mice, but it is highly expressed in the testes. They also found that pol ν may be involved in meiotic recombination in the testes, as there was a reduction in crossover frequency at a specific hotspot in mice lacking pol ν. However, pol ν does not appear to have a role in the tolerance of DNA crosslinks. Overall, this study provides insights into the function of pol ν in germ cells.[E] This paper investigates the role of pol ν, a DNA polymerase, in mammalian cells. The researchers generated knockout mouse models to study the effects of pol ν disruption. They found that pol ν is not essential for embryonic development or viability in mice, but it is highly expressed in the testes. Further analysis revealed that pol ν may be involved in meiotic recombination in the testes, as mice lacking pol ν showed a reduction in crossover frequency at a specific hotspot. However, the researchers did not observe any increased sensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents in cells lacking pol ν. These findings suggest that pol ν may have a specific function in germ cells, potentially related to meiotic recombination, but its role in DNA repair remains unclear.

The researchers suggest that LD2ED III could be a good candidate for a dengue vaccine.[E] This paper presents the development of a potential subunit vaccine candidate for dengue virus using the envelope protein domain III (ED III) as the antigen. The researchers expressed a recombinant form of ED III with a lipid moiety, called LD2ED III, which was highly immunogenic in mice and elicited strong antibody responses. They also found that LD2ED III had a low risk of inducing harmful effects, such as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) or autoantibody induction. The study highlights the potential of LD2ED III as a safe and effective vaccine candidate for dengue virus.
10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003357	[L] This paper explores the variability of protein kinase signaling pathways in cells. The authors focus on how external stimuli are transmitted through these pathways to trigger cellular responses. They discuss the two main types of signaling cascade behavior: gradual, which reflects the concentration of the stimulus, and ultrasensitive, which responds in an all-or-none manner once a threshold stimulus is reached. The authors analyze the dose-response behavior of these cascades and investigate how variability can be modulated by parameter tuning, gene expression noise regulation, or additional signaling mechanisms. They specifically look at the yeast pheromone pathway, which exhibits switch-like decision making with little cell-to-cell variability.[E] This paper examines the cell-to-cell variability of protein kinase signaling pathways in eukaryotic cells. The authors focus on the dose-response behavior of these pathways, exploring how the pathway sensitivity, maximal activation level, and steepness of the response curve are influenced by various factors. They investigate how negative feedback regulation, correlated protein concentration fluctuations, and other mechanisms can modulate the variability of signaling pathways. The authors also analyze the yeast pheromone pathway as a specific example, discussing how it achieves switch-like decision making with minimal cell-to-cell variability. They use mathematical models and simulations to investigate the properties of these signaling cascades and uncover the determinants of cell-to-cell variability.
10.1371/journal.ppat.1000431	[L] This paper discusses the immune response of CD8+ T cells to chronic infection with the Leishmania donovani parasite. The researchers show that the parasite is able to evade and suppress CD8+ T cell responses, leading to limited expansion, functional exhaustion, and cell death. They also demonstrate that the inhibitory receptor PD-1 and its ligand B7-H1 play a role in regulating CD8+ T cell function during the infection. Additionally, the researchers investigate the effects of B7-H1 blockade on CD8+ T cell responses and parasite burden, finding that blocking B7-H1 partially restores the CD8+ T cell response and reduces the parasite burden. The study suggests that targeting CD8+ T cell responses could be a potential therapeutic strategy against chronic Leishmania infections.[E] This paper explores the CD8+ T cell response to chronic infection with Leishmania donovani, a parasite responsible for visceral leishmaniasis. The researchers examine the expansion, function, and fate of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in mice infected with L. donovani parasites expressing ovalbumin. They find that the parasite evades CD8+ T cell responses, leading to limited expansion and functional exhaustion of the T cells. The inhibitory receptor PD-1 and its ligand B7-H1 are shown to play a role in regulating CD8+ T cell function, with B7-H1 upregulated on dendritic cells and PD-1 expressed by the CD8+ T cells. Blocking B7-H1 partially restores CD8+ T cell responses and reduces parasite burden in infected mice. The study suggests that targeting CD8+ T cell responses could be a potential therapeutic strategy for chronic Leishmania infections.
10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003057	[L] This paper investigates the misfolding of the prion protein (PrP) and the underlying molecular mechanism. The researchers performed microsecond molecular dynamics simulations of the structured C-terminal domain of the protein at low pH to mimic conditions in endosomes. They found that the protonation of a specific residue, H187, destabilizes the protein fold and leads to conformational changes. The protonation of H187 induces an electrostatic repulsion with a nearby residue, R136, which affects the structure of different regions of the protein. These findings provide insight into the possible pathways of PrP misfolding and the role of specific residues in the process.[E] This paper investigates the misfolding of the prion protein (PrP) and the role of protonation of a specific residue, H187, in destabilizing the protein fold. The researchers performed microsecond molecular dynamics simulations of the structured C-terminal domain of the protein at low pH, mimicking conditions in endosomes. They found that the protonation of H187 leads to an electrostatic repulsion with the nearby residue, R136, which affects the structure of different regions of the protein. Specifically, the protonation of H187 can lead to the unraveling of a helix in one region and the elongation of a secondary structure in another region. These conformational changes provide insights into the possible pathways of PrP misfolding and the role of specific residues in the process.
10.1371/journal.pntd.0003558	[L] This study looked at the effectiveness of a traditional treatment called epilation, which involves plucking eyelashes, compared to surgery for the treatment of trachoma, a leading cause of blindness. The researchers found that while surgery was more effective at reducing the number of lashes touching the eye, epilation was still able to control the condition for many patients. Additionally, many patients were unwilling to undergo surgery, highlighting the need for alternative treatment options for those who decline surgery. [E] This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of epilation, a traditional treatment for trachoma, with surgery in controlling trichiasis, a late-stage complication of trachoma. The researchers found that while surgery was more effective at reducing trichiasis, epilation was able to effectively control the condition for many patients. The study also highlighted the low surgical uptake among patients, suggesting a need for alternative treatment options for those who decline surgery. Overall, the findings suggest that good quality epilation, coupled with regular follow-up and access to surgery if needed, can be a reasonable second-line alternative to surgery for minor trichiasis.
10.1371/journal.ppat.0040017	[L] This scientific study focuses on the role of the mannose receptor (MR) in dengue virus (DV) infection. The researchers found that MR binds to DV and can facilitate viral entry into macrophages. They also discovered that the presence of Th2 cytokines, such as IL-4 and IL-13, increases the susceptibility of monocytes to DV infection. These findings provide a better understanding of the mechanisms behind DV infection and could potentially lead to the development of new treatments or vaccines.[E] The paper investigates the role of the mannose receptor (MR) in dengue virus (DV) infection. The researchers demonstrate that MR binds to DV and enhances viral entry into macrophages. They also show that treatment with Th2 cytokines, such as IL-4 and IL-13, increases the susceptibility of monocytes to DV infection. These findings have implications for our understanding of DV pathogenesis and may contribute to the development of therapeutics or vaccines that target MR to prevent or treat dengue.
10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005721	[L] This paper discusses the role of homeostatic mechanisms in regulating neural activity in the brain. The authors conducted simulations using a computational model and explored the effects of these mechanisms on the behavior of an agent in a virtual environment. They found that the presence of homeostatic mechanisms helped to stabilize neural dynamics and allowed the agent to navigate the environment more effectively. They also proposed that task-negative networks in the brain, such as the default mode network, may act as a counterbalance to task-positive networks, contributing to overall brain stability. [E] This paper investigates the regulatory role of homeostatic mechanisms in neural dynamics and behavior using a computational model. The authors adapt the Greenberg-Hastings model, which incorporates human structural connectivity, and introduce a virtual environment where an agent can move and interact. They explore the effects of local homeostatic plasticity mechanisms and macroscopic network balance on neural and behavioral dynamics. The findings suggest that homeostatic mechanisms are important for stabilizing neural dynamics and facilitating flexible behavior. The presence of task-negative networks, such as the default mode network, may serve as a macroscopic balancing system, counteracting destabilizing effects from sensory input. Overall, this study highlights the importance of considering multi-scale balancing mechanisms in understanding brain-environment interactions.
10.1371/journal.pgen.1006736	[L] This paper investigates how the three-dimensional organization of chromosomes in cells affects gene regulation. The researchers used a technique called Chromosome Conformation Capture to detect long-distance interactions between different parts of the genome in yeast. They found that some of these interactions can regulate gene expression. They also discovered that these interactions can affect the level of gene expression as well as the variability in gene expression between individual cells. Additionally, they identified different mechanisms by which genes can be repressed, including silencing and transcriptional interference. They concluded that the spatial organization of chromosomes plays a critical role in gene regulation.[E] This paper focuses on the role of three-dimensional chromosome organization in gene regulation. The researchers conducted experiments in yeast to investigate the impact of long-distance chromosomal interactions on gene expression. Using a reporter gene inserted at various genomic loci, they identified specific patterns of gene expression that deviate from the norm. They found that genes could be repressed through different mechanisms, such as silencing and transcriptional interference, resulting in varying levels of noise in gene expression. They also discovered that the clustering of certain genes within 3D chromosomal space can lead to their overexpression, potentially through the formation of sub-nuclear compartments with elevated concentrations of transcription factors. These findings contribute to our understanding of gene regulation and the role of chromosomal organization in this process.
10.1371/journal.pgen.1000557	[L] This paper investigates the process of chromosome separation during meiosis in yeast. It focuses on the role of a protein called Pch2 in controlling the formation of crossovers, which are crucial for the correct distribution of chromosomes. The study found that Pch2 associates with the chromosome axes and plays a role in regulating the levels and distribution of certain proteins involved in the crossover process. The authors propose a model in which Pch2 organizes the chromosome axes into modules that ensure the formation of crossovers and regulate their interference. [E] This paper explores the role of the protein Pch2 in meiosis in yeast. It specifically investigates how Pch2 controls the formation of crossovers, which are essential for the correct distribution of chromosomes. The authors demonstrate the association between Pch2 and chromosome axes and how it regulates the levels and distribution of certain proteins involved in crossover formation. They propose a model in which Pch2 organizes the chromosome axes into modules that ensure the formation of crossovers and regulate their interference. This study provides important insights into the mechanism of crossover control during meiosis.
10.1371/journal.pbio.1000139	[L] This paper discusses the role of a protein called RIN4 in regulating the immune response of plants to pathogens. The authors found that RIN4 interacts with a group of proteins known as PM H+-ATPases, which are involved in controlling stomatal apertures. Stomata are pores on the surface of leaves that allow for gas exchange, but they also serve as entry points for pathogens. The study shows that RIN4 acts as a positive regulator of PM H+-ATPases, which in turn regulate stomatal apertures in response to pathogen attack. This research provides insights into the mechanisms plants use to defend against infection.[E] This paper investigates the molecular interactions between RIN4, a negative regulator of pathogen-induced immunity in plants, and PM H+-ATPases, which are involved in stomatal regulation. The authors used yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation analyses to confirm the interaction between RIN4 and the C-terminal regulatory domains of AHA1 and AHA2, two members of the PM H+-ATPase family. They also demonstrated that RIN4 overexpression enhances PM H+-ATPase activity and stomatal opening, while rin4 knockout results in decreased PM H+-ATPase activity and impaired stomatal re-opening in response to virulent bacteria. These findings indicate that RIN4 positively regulates PM H+-ATPases, which play a crucial role in stomatal regulation during the innate immune response.
10.1371/journal.pntd.0005918	[L] This paper discusses the use of larviciding as a preventive measure against mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue and chikungunya in Europe. Larviciding involves treating potential breeding sites with larvicide products to reduce mosquito populations. The authors conducted a study in Northern Italy to assess the potential impact of larviciding on the transmission of these diseases and the resulting economic benefits. They found that larviciding can significantly reduce mosquito populations and the risk of outbreaks, particularly when implemented during the peak mosquito season. The cost-effectiveness of larviciding varied depending on the size of the urban area and the level of mosquito infestation. Overall, larviciding was found to be a sustainable and effective strategy for preventing the transmission of mosquito-borne diseases in Europe.[E] This paper presents a study that evaluates the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of larviciding as a routine vector control strategy against dengue and chikungunya in temperate climate municipalities in Europe. The authors used data from two seasons of entomological surveillance in Northern Italy to parametrize a mathematical model of mosquito population dynamics and transmission of these diseases. They found that larviciding led to a significant reduction in mosquito populations and the probability of local transmission. The timing and intensity of larviciding efforts varied depending on the size of the urban area and the level of mosquito infestation. The cost-effectiveness analysis demonstrated that larviciding was a sustainable and economically beneficial strategy in certain municipalities. However, the involvement of private citizens in larviciding activities was found to be less cost-effective. Overall, this study provides valuable insights for European municipalities in planning and implementing preventive vector control interventions against mosquito-borne diseases.

The researchers propose a sensorimotor system that relies on the timing and intensity of echoes, as well as the movement of the bat's ears, to guide its flight and prevent collisions. The system does not require the bat to create a 3D map of its surroundings, but instead utilizes real-time information to react quickly and effectively.

The controller is designed to operate in real-time, without the need for the bat to construct a 3D representation of its surroundings. The researchers conducted simulations in both 2D and 3D environments and found that the controller successfully avoided obstacles, demonstrating its potential as an efficient and responsive system for obstacle avoidance in bats.
10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000725	[L] This paper explores the evolution of metabolic networks and the optimization of metabolic pathways. The researchers use an artificial chemistry model to study the properties of optimal pathways that convert an input molecule into an output molecule. They find recurring patterns and modular organization in the pathways, as well as predictable trends in pathway length. They also observe the emergence of "universal metabolic tools" that are used across multiple optimal pathways. The researchers then compare their findings to real metabolic networks and find that some of the same patterns and principles apply, suggesting that fundamental optimality principles may have shaped biochemical networks.[E] This paper investigates the evolution and optimization of metabolic networks by studying the properties of optimal pathways in an artificial chemistry model.

They also identify "universal metabolic tools" that are used in multiple optimal pathways. Furthermore, they compare their findings to real metabolic networks and find similar patterns and principles, suggesting that fundamental optimality principles have played a role in shaping biochemical networks.
10.1371/journal.pgen.1007908	[L] This paper describes a new method called MAPS that can analyze genetic data to infer information about the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of population sizes and migration rates. The method uses geographic coordinates and genetic similarities between individuals measured by long pairwise shared coalescence (lPSC) segments.

The results showed that MAPS can reveal changes in dispersal rates and population sizes over different time periods.[E] The paper introduces a new method called MAPS (Migration And Population-size Surfaces) for inferring spatial and temporal heterogeneity in population sizes and migration rates using genetic data. The method is based on a likelihood function that relates the observed data (genetic similarities measured by sharing of long pairwise shared coalescence segments) to demographic parameters (migration rates and population sizes). MAPS draws inferences from the observed levels of pairwise shared coalescence segments, allowing for the estimation of absolute migration rates and population sizes. The authors tested MAPS on simulated data and applied it to a dataset of individuals from Europe, obtaining insights into the spatial and temporal patterns of population structure and migration.
10.1371/journal.pbio.2006972	[L] This study investigates the impact of insulin resistance on wound healing in the liver. The researchers used a mouse model to study the effects of knocking out the Irs2 gene on the ability of the liver to repair itself during chronic injury. They found that mice lacking Irs2 had impaired wound healing, reduced production of a growth factor called FGF7 by stromal cells, and decreased sensitivity of hepatic epithelial cells to FGF7. These findings suggest that insulin resistance may disrupt communication between stromal and epithelial cells and impair the healing process in the liver. [E] The paper investigates the role of insulin resistance in wound healing in the liver, focusing on the interaction between stromal and epithelial cells. The study uses a mouse model with knockout of the insulin receptor substrate 2 (Irs2) gene and examines the effects on hepatic wound healing during chronic injury. The results show that Irs2 deficiency leads to impaired liver repair, reduced production of fibroblast growth factor 7 (FGF7) in the stromal cells, and decreased sensitivity of hepatic epithelial cells to FGF7. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms by which insulin resistance may affect wound healing in the liver and highlights the importance of stromal-epithelial crosstalk in the healing process.
10.1371/journal.pgen.1006579	[L] The paper discusses the role of a protein called IRE-1 in the development of neuronal dendrites, which are branch-like structures that help neurons transmit signals. The researchers studied the PVD neuron in the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans and rat hippocampal neurons to understand how IRE-1 affects dendrite growth. They found that IRE-1 is necessary for proper dendrite branching and that inhibiting IRE-1 activity leads to defects in dendrite morphology. The study also revealed that reducing insulin/IGF-1 signaling, a pathway involved in growth and metabolism, can restore normal dendrite architecture in animals lacking IRE-1. These findings highlight the importance of IRE-1 and insulin/IGF-1 signaling in neuronal development and suggest potential new approaches for treating neurodegenerative disorders.[E] This paper investigates the role of the protein IRE-1 in dendrite arbor morphogenesis, the process by which dendritic branches form. The authors demonstrate that IRE-1 is necessary for proper dendrite branching in the PVD neuron of C. elegans and rat hippocampal neurons. They show that inhibiting IRE-1 activity leads to defects in dendrite morphology, specifically in higher order branching. The study also reveals that reducing insulin/IGF-1 signaling can restore normal dendrite architecture in animals lacking IRE-1. Furthermore, the authors provide evidence that the localization defect of the DMA-1 receptor in ire-1 mutants is a consequence of a block in the secretory pathway. They propose that the effect of reducing insulin/IGF-1 signaling on dendrite morphology may be due to improved ER homeostasis. Overall, this work establishes a conserved role for IRE-1 in dendritic dendrite morphogenesis and suggests that modulating insulin/IGF-1 signaling could be a potential therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative disorders.
10.1371/journal.pgen.1003839	[L] This paper discusses the importance of maintaining redox balance in cells and the role of the ArcA transcription factor in regulating this balance. The authors used various techniques, including chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing, to map the binding sites of ArcA in E. coli. They found that ArcA regulates the expression of many genes associated with aerobic respiratory metabolism, as well as genes involved in adapting to microaerobic or anaerobic environments. They also identified a novel binding motif for ArcA and showed that the architecture of ArcA binding sites can vary. Overall, this study provides new insights into the physiological role and mechanism of action of ArcA in E. coli. [E] This paper investigates the regulation and mechanism of action of the ArcA transcription factor in Escherichia coli. The authors used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing and microarray hybridization to map the binding sites of ArcA in the E. coli genome. They identified 176 binding regions and discovered a novel binding motif for ArcA that extends the previously described recognition site. They also performed gene expression profiling to identify the direct targets of ArcA and found that it regulates the expression of many genes associated with aerobic respiratory metabolism. The authors also investigated the architecture of ArcA binding sites and found that they can vary in the number and spacing of direct repeat elements. This study provides new insights into the regulatory role of ArcA in E. coli and expands our understanding of its physiological functions.
10.1371/journal.pgen.1001271	[L] The pituitary gland is an important part of the body that regulates various functions such as growth, reproduction, and stress responses. Pituitary tumors can cause serious complications and the development of these tumors is not fully understood. In this study, researchers investigated the role of a gene called usp39 in pituitary development using zebrafish as a model organism. They found that loss of usp39 led to defects in a gene called rb1, which is involved in regulating cell growth. This resulted in an expansion of pituitary cell populations. The researchers also identified another gene called e2f4, which was overexpressed in usp39 mutant fish and contributed to the cell expansion. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms underlying pituitary tumor formation.[E] This study focused on the role of the usp39 gene in pituitary development using zebrafish as a model organism. The researchers found that loss of usp39 resulted in defects in rb1 mRNA splicing, leading to downregulation of the rb1 gene. This was associated with an expansion of pituitary cell populations, particularly in corticotropes and lactotropes. The study also identified e2f4 as an important factor involved in the cell expansion, as its overexpression was observed in usp39 mutant fish. Knockdown of e2f4 partially rescued the pituitary phenotype in usp39 mutants, indicating the involvement of e2f4 in the expansion of adenohypophyseal cell lineages. Overall, these findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying pituitary development and may have implications for understanding pituitary tumor formation.
10.1371/journal.ppat.1003200	[L] Viral infections in the fetus and young infant can cause abnormal brain development and permanent neurological problems. This study focused on neonatal mice infected with murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) to understand the effects of inflammation on brain development. The researchers found that inflammation caused by MCMV infection led to abnormalities in cerebellar development, including delayed lamination and reduced cerebellar area. Treatment with anti-inflammatory glucocorticoids reduced inflammation and normalized the developmental abnormalities. These findings suggest that inflammation in the brain during viral infections can disrupt normal brain development. [E] This study investigated the effects of inflammation on brain development in neonatal mice infected with MCMV. The researchers found that MCMV infection led to abnormalities in cerebellar development, including delayed lamination and reduced cerebellar area. These abnormalities were associated with an increase in the inflammatory response in the CNS. Treatment with anti-inflammatory glucocorticoids, such as dexamethasone or prednisolone, reduced inflammation and normalized cerebellar development. The study suggests that inflammation during viral infections can have detrimental effects on brain development and that reducing inflammation could be a potential therapeutic approach.
10.1371/journal.pntd.0001428	[L] Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is a bacteria that causes diarrheal illness in developing countries, leading to many infections and deaths each year. ETEC is the most common cause of traveler's diarrhea and is found in areas with poor sanitation and clean drinking water. ETEC produces toxins that cause diarrhea and uses colonization factors to attach to the small intestine. Current vaccine development for ETEC is limited because these colonization factors are not cross-protective and many strains of ETEC do not produce them. This study focuses on other surface proteins of ETEC called autotransporter proteins, specifically antigen 43 and plasmid-encoded autotransporter protein (pAT). The researchers found that these proteins are recognized by the immune system during ETEC infection and can elicit protective immune responses. They suggest that these autotransporter proteins could be potential targets for ETEC vaccine development.[E] Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is a major cause of diarrheal illness, particularly in developing countries, resulting in a significant number of infections and deaths each year. This study explores the potential of autotransporter proteins, specifically antigen 43 and plasmid-encoded autotransporter protein (pAT), as targets for ETEC vaccine development. Previous vaccine efforts have focused on plasmid-encoded colonization factors, but their heterogeneity and lack of cross-protection make them challenging targets. The researchers found that the passenger domains of antigen 43 and pAT were recognized during experimental infections in animals and natural infections in humans. Immunization with these passenger domains stimulated immune responses and provided protection against subsequent ETEC colonization. These findings suggest that autotransporter proteins could be promising targets for ETEC vaccines and highlight the importance of exploring conserved, chromosomally-encoded antigens in vaccine development.
10.1371/journal.pntd.0007100	[L] Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a serious and often fatal infection caused by a virus transmitted by ticks. The virus has been found in many countries and can infect animals, as well as humans. People can become infected through tick bites or through direct contact with the blood or body fluids of infected individuals or animals. Symptoms include fever, muscle pain, headache, and bleeding, and the disease can be deadly. The mortality rate varies across countries. In Oman, where this study was conducted, cases have been reported since 1995, with an increase in recent years. The study examined the clinical and epidemiological features of CCHF cases in Oman and analyzed the genetic characteristics of the virus. It found that the majority of cases occurred in males involved in butchering or slaughtering animals. The study provides insights into the spread and impact of CCHF in Oman and the surrounding region.[E] Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a severe viral infection with a high mortality rate caused by the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV). This study investigated the clinical and epidemiological features of CCHF cases in Oman between 1995 and 2017, as well as the genetic characteristics of the virus. The study found that CCHF cases in Oman have been increasing since 2011, with a peak in 2015. Most cases were male and involved individuals involved in the butchering or slaughtering of animals. The study also identified the prevalent clade of CCHFV in Oman, which belonged to the Asia lineage 1 (clade IV). These findings highlight the endemic nature of CCHF in Oman and the need for improved surveillance and prevention strategies.
10.1371/journal.pgen.1000919	[L] This paper discusses the robustness and fragility of the budding yeast cell cycle in response to overexpression of certain genes. The researchers used a genetic experiment called "genetic tug-of-war" to measure the copy number limit of overexpression of cell cycle-related genes. They found that dosage imbalance between certain enzymes and their inhibitors caused cellular fragility upon overexpression of the genes. By modifying a mathematical model of cell cycle regulation, they were able to reproduce the experimental results and gain insight into the mechanisms underlying fragility and robustness in the yeast cell cycle.[E] This paper investigates the robustness and fragility of the budding yeast cell cycle when certain genes are overexpressed. The researchers used a genetic experiment called "genetic tug-of-war" to measure the copy number limit of overexpression for cell cycle-related genes. They discovered that fragility arose from dosage imbalance between certain enzymes and their inhibitors. By modifying a mathematical model of the cell cycle, they were able to accurately predict the experimental results and gain a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms. This study highlights the importance of dosage balance in maintaining the robustness of cellular systems and demonstrates how mathematical modeling can be used to improve our understanding of complex biological processes.
10.1371/journal.ppat.1007416	[L] This paper discusses the role of the protein STAT6 in the replication of the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and other human herpesviruses. The authors found that KSHV induces the degradation of STAT6 during the lytic phase of the virus's life cycle, which is necessary for viral replication. The degradation of STAT6 is mediated by the viral protein RTA, which interacts with STAT6 and promotes its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. This process is dependent on both the proteasome and lysosomal pathways. The authors also discovered that the degradation of STAT6 is not specific to KSHV, but also occurs during the lytic replication of other herpesviruses, including Epstein-Barr virus, human cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus 1.[E] This paper elucidates the mechanism by which the protein STAT6 is degraded during the lytic replication of KSHV and other human herpesviruses. The authors demonstrate that the viral protein RTA interacts with STAT6 and promotes its ubiquitination and degradation via the proteasome and lysosomal pathways. This degradation of STAT6 is not dependent on phosphorylation at a key tyrosine residue, but rather on its interaction with RTA and subsequent ubiquitination. The authors also show that the degradation of STAT6 is not specific to KSHV, but also occurs during the lytic replication of other herpesviruses. These findings highlight the importance of STAT6 degradation in the lytic replication of herpesviruses, and suggest that targeting this process could be a potential therapeutic strategy for viral infections.

10.1371/journal.pgen.1006312	[L] This paper discusses the process of endosporulation, which is a bacterial cell differentiation process that allows a vegetative cell to transform into a spore. Spores are highly resistant and can survive in extreme conditions, making them an important vehicle for pathogens like Bacillus anthracis, Bacillus cereus, and Clostridium difficile. C. difficile causes antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and its spores contribute to the transmission and establishment of the bacteria in the environment. While sporulation has been extensively studied in other bacteria, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of spore development in C. difficile is limited. The paper explores the genetic control and differences in sporulation between aerobic bacilli and anaerobic clostridia, highlighting the importance of communication between the mother cell and forespore during the process.[E] This paper delves into the intricate process of endosporulation, a highly conserved bacterial cell differentiation process that transforms a vegetative cell into a spore. The authors focus specifically on Clostridium difficile, a pathogenic bacterium responsible for antibiotic-associated diarrhea. They provide a comprehensive analysis of the genetic control and molecular mechanisms underlying sporulation in C. difficile, comparing it to the model organism Bacillus subtilis. The paper highlights the differences and similarities in the signaling pathways and regulation of sporulation genes between aerobic bacilli and anaerobic clostridia. Additionally, it investigates the role of specific proteins, such as CD1231 and CD1234, in skinCd excision, an essential step in the regulation of sporulation in C. difficile. The findings contribute to our understanding of spore development in this pathogenic bacterium and shed light on potential targets for therapeutic interventions.

10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003830	[L] The paper investigates the relationship between the rate of evolution of the HIV-1 virus and the risk of disease progression in patients with different genetic backgrounds. The researchers found that patients with higher CD4+ T cell counts at baseline had lower rates of viral evolution and were at lower risk of progressing to AIDS. They observed that the difference in viral evolution rates between patients with high and low risk of disease progression was mainly driven by changes in synonymous (neutral) substitutions. This suggests that the replication rate of the virus is influenced by the state of the host's immune system and that higher CD4+ T cell counts can help control viral replication.[E] This paper focuses on the relationship between HIV-1 viral evolution rates and disease progression in patients with different genetic backgrounds. The researchers studied six untreated HIV-1 infected patients who carried the HLA-B*5701 allele and followed them over seven years. They found that patients with higher CD4+ T cell counts at baseline had lower rates of viral evolution and were at a lower risk of disease progression. Further analysis revealed that the difference in viral evolution rates between patients with high and low risk of disease progression was primarily driven by changes in synonymous (neutral) substitutions. This suggests that the replication rate of the virus is influenced by the host's immune system, specifically the CD4+ T cell counts. The findings provide insights into the factors that contribute to the variability in disease progression among HIV-1 infected individuals.

The authors identified a gene, TbMCP14, that is involved in the mode of action of these drugs. They found that down-regulation of TbMCP14 in trypanosomes resulted in resistance to the choline analog drugs, while over-expression of the gene increased susceptibility to the drugs.

10.1371/journal.pbio.3000175	[L] This paper discusses the BRS3 receptor, which is a protein involved in transmitting signals within the body. The authors show that BRS3 is considered an orphan receptor, meaning it does not have a known ligand that activates it. However, the authors demonstrate that BRS3 may actually have endogenous ligands called NMB and GRP in nonplacental vertebrates. They also find that in placental mammals, BRS3 has undergone changes that prevent it from binding to these ligands, and instead it constitutively activates signaling pathways in a ligand-independent manner. The study suggests that BRS3 may be a genuinely orphan receptor in placental mammals, including humans. [E] The paper investigates the evolutionary history and functional characteristics of the BRS3 receptor. The authors analyze the genetic relationships among BRS3, GRPR, NMBR, and other related receptors across different vertebrate species. They find that BRS3 in nonplacental vertebrates is connected to its endogenous ligands NMB and GRP, while placental mammalian BRS3 has lost this connection. They also identify key residues and structural differences that contribute to the ligand-independent constitutive activity of placental mammalian BRS3. The study provides insights into the evolution and function of BRS3 in different vertebrate species.

The researchers found that the parasite is able to manipulate host cell pathways to acquire isoprenoids for its own use. They also discovered that drugs that inhibit the production of isoprenoids in the host cell are effective in killing the parasite. They propose a strategy of combining inhibitors of both the parasite and host pathways as a potential treatment for T. gondii infection. [E] This paper investigates the importance of isoprenoids in the growth and survival of the parasite Toxoplasma gondii. The researchers demonstrate that T. gondii is able to manipulate host cell pathways to acquire isoprenoids for its own synthesis. They also show that drugs that inhibit the production of isoprenoids in the host cell, such as statins, are effective in killing the parasite. The researchers propose a double-hit strategy of combining inhibitors of both the parasite and host isoprenoid pathways as a potential treatment for T. gondii infection. They provide evidence from in vitro and in vivo experiments to support the efficacy of this strategy.

The authors sequenced the genomes of P. musae and P. eumusae, and compared them with the previously sequenced genome of P. fijiensis, in order to understand the genomic changes associated with shifts in virulence. They found that the three species exhibit differences in genome size and composition, as well as in their gene content and functional categories. These differences likely contribute to the variation in their virulence and ability to infect and damage banana plants.[E] This paper presents a genomic analysis of three closely related fungal species that cause the Sigatoka disease in banana plants.

10.1371/journal.pntd.0005123	[L] This paper investigates the gene expression patterns in individuals infected with Leishmania donovani or L. infantum parasites, which can cause a range of clinical outcomes from asymptomatic infection to active visceral leishmaniasis (VL). The researchers hypothesize that understanding the gene expression in individuals with different states of infection can reveal new insights into the immunological processes involved in VL. They collected whole blood samples from individuals with VL, individuals under remission of the disease, asymptomatic individuals, and uninfected controls. They conducted microarray analysis and identified differentially expressed genes that were associated with different states of infection. They found that VL patients exhibited down-regulation of genes related to the innate immune response, up-regulation of genes related to T cell activation, and increased expression of type I interferon-related genes. Patients under remission of disease showed increased expression of B cell-related genes. These findings provide new insights into the immunobiology of human VL, suggesting that different molecular mechanisms are involved in the progression of the disease.[E] This paper investigates the gene expression profiles in individuals with different clinical states of infection with Leishmania donovani or L. infantum parasites.

Their findings provide insights into the evolutionary dynamics of social interactions in D. discoideum and suggest that seemingly complex social behaviors can emerge from a simple underlying signaling system.
10.1371/journal.pgen.1008248	[L] This paper discusses the process of mRNA targeting and localized translation, which is important for controlling protein synthesis in cells.

However, they present evidence suggesting the existence of additional pathways, as well as the involvement of mRNAs encoding proteins without signal sequences in ER localization. Through computational analysis and experimental tools, they identify a sequence motif called SECReTE that is enriched in mRNAs encoding secretome proteins. This motif is shown to play a role in mRNA stability, localization, and translation at the ER. The authors propose that SECReTE may have a conserved function across different organisms and could have practical applications in biotechnology.

The researchers used RNA-seq technology to analyze the gene expression of 44 different mutant mouse lines. They found that both TRAP and DEL mutations led to local effects on nearby genes, with DEL mutations showing a higher frequency of these effects.

10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006579	[L] This paper discusses the reproducibility of embryonic development in multicellular organisms and the impact of biochemical reactions at the single-cell level, which are inherently stochastic. The authors used computational modeling to study somitogenesis, a process in vertebrate embryos where equal-sized somites are continuously produced. They found that the clock and wavefront model, which explains somitogenesis, does not take into account the effect of noise on development. By incorporating noise into their computational model, the authors observed that somite formation was still possible even in the absence of the clock but resulted in irregularly sized somites. They also identified the role of cell-cell interactions and positive feedback in reducing the impact of noise on somitogenesis. Overall, this study highlights the importance of considering noise and its management in understanding developmental reproducibility.[E] This paper investigates the impact of noise on the reproducibility of embryonic development, specifically focusing on somitogenesis in vertebrates. By developing a computational model, the authors demonstrate that even in the presence of noise, the stepwise shift in ERK activity that is essential for somite formation can still occur. They also show that cell-cell interactions and positive feedback play crucial roles in reducing the impact of noise and maintaining reproducibility. Additionally, they find that while the clock is necessary for precise somite formation, the irregularity observed in clock-deficient embryos can be attributed to the presence of noise. This study provides insights into the mechanisms that contribute to the robustness and reproducibility of developmental processes in the presence of intrinsic noise.

The study revealed distinct phylogenetic lineages within Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia, indicating limited viral dispersal between countries. The researchers also assessed the role of landscape features and human activities, such as road networks and population sizes, in shaping the spread of rabies in dog populations. They found that road distances were the best predictor of viral spread, suggesting that human-assisted dog movement plays a significant role in the transmission of rabies. The study highlights the importance of understanding the factors influencing rabies transmission for effective control strategies.

10.1371/journal.pntd.0003174	[L] Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a fungal infection commonly found in South America. Despite advances in knowledge about the disease, it still has high mortality rates and is not well-known. The gold standard for diagnosing PCM is to visualize yeast cells or isolate the fungus in a culture. However, these methods can be time-consuming and not always accurate. Serological tests have been developed as a simpler and cheaper alternative for diagnosing PCM. However, different laboratories use different protocols and antigen preparations, leading to inconsistencies in the results. In this study, researchers compared the performance of six different reference centers in Brazil that perform serological diagnosis of PCM. The results showed that there were major discrepancies among the laboratories, which could potentially lead to conflicting treatment decisions for patients. This highlights the need for better standardization of serological diagnosis for PCM.[E] Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a systemic fungal infection endemic to South America. Although much progress has been made in understanding the disease since its discovery in 1908, PCM still poses a significant public health concern with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Currently, the gold standard for diagnosing PCM involves the visualization of yeast cells or isolation of the fungus in culture. However, these methods have limitations in terms of sensitivity and turnaround time. Serological tests have been established as a rapid and inexpensive diagnostic tool for PCM, but there is significant variability in the protocols and antigen preparations used by different laboratories. This study compared the performance of six medical mycology reference centers in Brazil that routinely perform serological diagnosis of PCM. The results revealed inconsistencies among the laboratories, leading to conflicting information regarding patient treatment. The findings emphasize the need for improved standardization of serological diagnosis for PCM to ensure accurate and reliable diagnostic results.

10.1371/journal.pntd.0006446	[L] Schistosomiasis, also known as bilharziasis, is a chronic infectious disease caused by a parasite called Schistosoma. This parasite infects millions of people worldwide and is a major public health concern in many developing countries. Treatment for schistosomiasis relies on a single drug, but there is a need for alternative therapies. In this study, researchers focused on a specific enzyme called SmSP2, which is produced by the schistosome parasite. They characterized the enzyme and found that it plays a role in various physiological processes, including blood clotting and blood pressure regulation. SmSP2 was also shown to process host proteins and peptides, which may interfere with the parasite's survival and immune evasion mechanisms. These findings suggest that SmSP2 could be a potential target for new anti-schistosomal treatments.[E] This paper describes the biochemical and enzymatic characterization of the serine protease SmSP2 from the parasite Schistosoma mansoni. SmSP2 is abundantly expressed in blood-dwelling stages of the parasite and has been identified as a potential vaccine target. The researchers purified the enzyme and determined its substrate specificity, pH activity profile, and inhibition profile. They showed that SmSP2 preferentially cleaves peptides with basic amino acids at the P1 position. They also demonstrated that SmSP2 can process various host proteins and peptides involved in blood clotting, fibrinolysis, and blood pressure regulation. The localization of SmSP2 in different tissues of the parasite, along with its presence in the excretory/secretory products, suggests that it plays a role in various physiological processes and may be a target for new anti-schistosomal therapeutics.

10.1371/journal.pgen.1002192	[L] This study developed a method to study stem cells and tissue dynamics in mammals. The researchers used somatic microsatellite mutations to reconstruct cell lineage trees and gain information about the history and behavior of stem cells. They applied their method to study the intestinal epithelium and found that stem cells in this tissue undergo constant symmetric cell divisions and monoclonal conversions, and do not retain an immortal strand of DNA. They also found that colon crypts are separate from other cell types, such as hematopoietic stem cells, suggesting that there is no renewal of the intestinal epithelium by bone marrow cells during adulthood.[E] The study presents a novel method for studying stem cell and tissue dynamics in mammals, using somatic microsatellite mutations to reconstruct cell lineage trees. The researchers applied this method to the intestinal epithelium and obtained important insights into the behavior of stem cells in this tissue.

These findings suggest that targeted cytotoxic interventions, such as immunotoxins, may be effective in complementing ART for the eradication of HIV.
10.1371/journal.pntd.0000360	[L] Dengue is a tropical disease caused by a virus called dengue virus. It can cause mild symptoms like fever, or more severe symptoms like bleeding and shock. There are currently no vaccines or specific treatments for dengue, so early diagnosis is crucial for proper patient management. This study evaluated the accuracy of two commercial tests for diagnosing dengue by detecting a protein called NS1. The tests were found to be specific for dengue, but their sensitivity varied depending on factors like the level of virus in the patient's bloodstream and the presence of certain antibodies. The study also found that NS1 levels were higher in patients with more severe disease. Overall, the NS1 tests provide an additional tool for diagnosing dengue, but further research is needed to fully understand their limitations and potential benefits.[E] This study aimed to assess the performance of two commercial tests, the Platelia ELISA and a lateral flow rapid test (NS1-LFRT), in accurately diagnosing acute dengue infection. The tests detect the NS1 protein, which is secreted by cells infected with dengue virus. The sensitivity and specificity of both tests were evaluated in a population of Vietnamese patients with different disease severities and viral serotypes. The study found that both tests were specific for diagnosing acute dengue, but their sensitivity varied depending on factors such as the level of virus in the patient's bloodstream and the presence of certain antibodies. The NS1 tests were more sensitive within the first 3 days of illness and in primary dengue cases. However, their sensitivity was lower in patients with secondary dengue and DENV-2 infections. The study also found that NS1 levels were higher in patients with more severe disease. These findings suggest that NS1 tests can be a useful additional tool for diagnosing acute dengue, but their limitations should be taken into consideration. Further research is needed to fully understand their potential prognostic value and the implications for patient management.
10.1371/journal.pntd.0006159	[L] This study investigates the barriers to vaccinating dogs against rabies in urban areas of Sub Saharan Africa. The researchers conducted a city-wide mass dog vaccination campaign in Blantyre, Malawi and analyzed data on dog owners' attendance at static vaccination points (SPs).

These compounds could be potential candidates for the development of new drugs to treat the disease.[E] Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by parasites of the Leishmania genus. Visceral leishmaniasis, the most severe form of the disease, has high morbidity and mortality rates. The current treatment is inadequate due to issues such as toxicity, high cost, and drug resistance. In this study, researchers investigated the potential of bacteria associated with ants to produce natural products with antiprotozoal activity. They isolated several strains of actinobacteria from different ant species and found that some of these strains exhibited strong inhibition against a pathogenic fungus that infects the ants. Further analysis led to the identification of four compounds, including antibiotics and ionophores, with potent activity against the parasite that causes leishmaniasis. These findings highlight the potential of bacteria associated with ants as a source of antiprotozoal compounds and provide valuable leads for the development of new drugs to combat leishmaniasis.

10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002897	[L] This paper explores how the brain can learn and process information by changing the connections between neurons based on the timing of their signals. The authors focus on a specific learning rule called spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), which adjusts the strength of connections based on the relative timing of pre- and post-synaptic spikes. They show that STDP can encode temporal correlations in neuronal activity and can lead to the selection of specific axonal delays in the connections between neurons. This learning mechanism could potentially explain how the brain processes sound localization and pitch perception.[E] In this paper, the authors investigate how the brain can learn patterns and process information using spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) and the encoding of temporal correlations in neuronal activity. They examine how STDP can lead to the selection of specific axonal delays in the connections between neurons, enabling the encoding of temporal information. They also explore how STDP affects the response of the network to oscillatory inputs, demonstrating that it can lead to frequency selectivity. Additionally, they extend their analysis to networks with a wide range of delays and multiple groups of neurons, showing how delay selection can occur in these more complex scenarios. The authors provide both analytical derivations and numerical simulations to support their findings.

The study uses a mathematical model to predict the efficacy of this intervention. The results show that significant reductions in human incidence of infection can be achieved by treating a high percentage of dogs with systemic insecticides, and that the insecticides should have an initial efficacy greater than 80% and remain effective for at least 6 months. This intervention could be an alternative or complementary strategy to current control measures for ZVL transmission.[E] This paper presents the results of a mathematical modeling study that evaluates the efficacy of using systemic insecticides in dogs as a strategy to reduce human infections of Leishmania infantum causing Zoonotic Visceral Leishmaniasis (ZVL). The modeling exercise simulates different intervention scenarios and calculates the number of infected dogs and new human infections for each scenario. The results show that significant reductions in human incidence of infection can be achieved by community-wide use of systemic insecticides in dogs, with the minimum requirements being an initial efficacy greater than 80% and a duration of effectiveness above 65% for at least 6 months. The study also explores the sensitivity of the model to various parameters and identifies sand fly mortality as the parameter that has the greatest impact on the reduction in human incidence. The findings suggest that systemic insecticides for dogs could be a viable intervention strategy for controlling ZVL transmission in endemic regions.
10.1371/journal.ppat.1000746	[L] This paper discusses the importance of understanding the molecular processes involved in the invasion of red blood cells by the malaria parasite in order to develop new strategies to combat malaria. The researchers studied the release of microneme and rhoptry proteins in Plasmodium falciparum merozoites, the stage of the parasite responsible for invading red blood cells. They found that the release of these proteins is triggered by different external signals, with the release of microneme proteins being stimulated by exposure to low potassium ion concentrations, and the release of rhoptry proteins being triggered by interaction with specific receptors on the red blood cell surface. Understanding these signaling pathways could lead to the development of new drugs and vaccines to inhibit invasion and limit parasite growth.[E] This paper presents a detailed study on the molecular mechanisms involved in the invasion of red blood cells by the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. The researchers focused on the release of proteins from micronemes and rhoptries, two important organelles involved in the invasion process. By using various techniques such as flow cytometry and immunofluorescence assays, they determined that the release of these proteins is triggered by distinct external signals. The release of microneme proteins, such as EBA175 and AMA1, is stimulated by exposure to low potassium ion concentrations, whereas the release of rhoptry proteins, such as CLAG3.1 and PfRH2b, is triggered by interaction with specific receptors on the red blood cell surface. Furthermore, they found that the rise in cytosolic calcium levels plays a crucial role in the release of microneme proteins, while the engagement of these proteins with their receptors is required for the release of rhoptry proteins. These findings provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms of invasion and could potentially lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for combating malaria.
10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005724	[L] This paper discusses the challenges of delivering drugs to solid tumors due to the abnormal structure of tumor blood vessels. The authors explain that these abnormal vessels, along with the lack of a functional lymphatic system, cause an increase in interstitial fluid pressure within the tumor, making it difficult for drugs to penetrate the tumor. They propose using antiangiogenic agents, which can decrease vessel permeability and density, as a way to "normalize" the tumor vasculature and improve drug delivery. The authors use mathematical modeling to simulate the effects of different drug regimens on drug extravasation and tumor response. They find that combining antiangiogenic agents with chemotherapy can lead to improved drug delivery, with the best results observed when the antiangiogenic treatment starts before chemotherapy.[E] This paper presents a mathematical model to study the impact of tumor vasculature normalization on drug delivery in solid tumors. The authors highlight the abnormal structure of tumor blood vessels and the resulting increase in interstitial fluid pressure, which hinders the penetration of drugs into the tumor. They suggest using antiangiogenic agents to normalize the tumor vasculature and improve drug delivery. The mathematical model incorporates tumor growth, vessel dynamics, interstitial fluid flow, and drug transport. The authors investigate different drug regimens and observe that combining antiangiogenic agents with chemotherapy can lead to improved drug extravasation and tumor response. They emphasize the importance of carefully tailoring the dosing and scheduling of combination therapy to maximize drug delivery and tumor regression.
10.1371/journal.ppat.1003291	[L] This paper discusses how HIV uses dendritic cells to spread throughout the body. Dendritic cells are immune cells that can pick up HIV particles and transfer them to other cells, allowing the virus to evade the immune system. The researchers discovered that a protein called CD169 plays a key role in this process. CD169 binds to a sugar molecule called GM3 that is found on the surface of HIV particles, allowing the virus to attach to dendritic cells. By targeting CD169, scientists may be able to develop new strategies to prevent the spread of HIV.[E] This paper investigates the role of CD169 in HIV capture and transfer by dendritic cells. The researchers found that CD169 acts as a receptor for GM3 on HIV particles, facilitating the attachment and capture of the virus by dendritic cells. They also demonstrated that CD169 is responsible for the enhanced capture of HIV particles by mature dendritic cells. Inhibition of CD169 expression or blocking CD169 activity significantly reduced viral capture and transfer. Furthermore, CD169 was shown to mediate the trafficking of captured virus particles to dendritic cell-T cell synapses. The results suggest that CD169 is a crucial factor in dendritic cell-mediated HIV infection and may serve as a potential target for intervention strategies.
10.1371/journal.pgen.1002246	[L] This paper investigates the role of proteoglycans (PGs) in the development of vertebrate bone. The researchers studied zebrafish mutants with defects in PG synthesis genes and found that loss of chondroitin sulfate PGs (CSPGs) accelerated the process of bone formation, while loss of heparan sulfate PGs (HSPGs) delayed it. They also discovered that the mutations in PG synthesis genes caused premature differentiation of chondrocytes, leading to early bone formation. These findings contribute to our understanding of the genes involved in skeletal development and could have implications for the treatment of skeletal defects.[E] This paper investigates the role of proteoglycans (PGs), specifically chondroitin sulfate PGs (CSPGs), in the regulation of endochondral ossification, the process by which vertebrate bone develops. The researchers studied zebrafish mutants with defects in fam20b and xylt1, two critical genes involved in CSPG synthesis. They found that loss of CSPGs resulted in accelerated bone formation, while loss of heparan sulfate PGs (HSPGs) had the opposite effect. The mutants exhibited premature differentiation of chondrocytes, which are responsible for producing the cartilage matrix. This premature differentiation was associated with altered expression of markers of chondrocyte maturation and increased expression of indian hedgehog (ihh), a key regulator of endochondral ossification. The results of this study provide new insights into the role of PGs in skeletal development and expand our understanding of the genes involved in regulating the timing of endochondral ossification.

Through a comprehensive survey conducted in Jiangsu province, China, the researchers investigated the presence of SFTSV in ticks and small wild animals. They found evidence of vertical transmission of the virus in Haemaphysalis longicornis ticks, suggesting that this tick species may serve as a natural reservoir host for SFTSV. The study also identified SFTSV RNA and viral antibodies in small wild mammals, indicating that these animals may act as amplifying hosts for the virus. Additionally, SFTSV antibodies were detected in migratory birds captured during the tick-feeding season, implying a potential role for these birds in long-distance transmission of SFTSV. These findings contribute to our understanding of SFTS and can inform efforts to prevent the further spread of the disease.

10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005793	[L] This paper investigates how changes in protein interaction networks can impact the function of genes in breast cancer. By analyzing gene expression data from breast tumors and healthy breast tissue, the authors identified changes in the protein interaction networks that led to significant gains or losses in gene function in cancer. These changes were associated with an increased frequency of mutations in the genes involved, as well as an impact on patient survival. The authors also showed that using this network-based approach to assess gene function was more predictive of patient survival than traditional methods that only consider gene expression levels.[E] This paper explores the impact of protein interaction network (PIN) changes on gene function in breast cancer. By analyzing gene expression data from breast tumors and healthy breast tissue, the authors identified changes in the PIN that led to significant gains or losses in gene function in cancer. They found that these changes were associated with an increased frequency of mutations and copy number decreases in the genes involved, suggesting that alterations in the PIN may contribute to functional changes in cancer. Furthermore, they showed that these functional changes were associated with patient survival risk and could be used to predict clinical subtypes of breast cancer. Overall, this network-based approach to assessing gene function provides a more comprehensive and predictive understanding of breast cancer biology.
10.1371/journal.ppat.1006419	[L] This paper discusses the process of diversification in pathogen populations, specifically focusing on influenza A viruses (IAVs) in ducks. The study found that mallards pre-challenged with a strain of low-pathogenic IAV (LPIAV) were protected against homologous re-infection for up to 15 weeks. The ducks also exhibited partial protection against heterologous subtypes, indicating the development of cross-immunity. Additionally, the study found that the level of protection was influenced by the genetic relatedness of the different IAV subtypes.

10.1371/journal.pgen.1003892	[L] This paper discusses the role of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in bacterial evolution and the spread of antibiotic resistance. The main mechanisms of HGT are transformation mediated by natural competence, transduction, phage-related chromosomal islands (PRCI), and conjugation performed by plasmids or integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs). The paper focuses on the regulation of conjugation in B. subtilis plasmid pLS20. The authors identify an Xre-type repressor as the main transcriptional repressor that keeps the pLS20 conjugation system off. They also find that conjugation is not activated by recipient-produced pheromones but instead by a plasmid-encoded anti-repressor called RapLS20. Activation of the conjugation genes is ultimately controlled by a signaling peptide called Phr*LS20, which regulates the activity of RapLS20. The authors provide insights into the regulation and function of the pLS20 conjugation system and how it may play a role in bacterial evolution and spread of antibiotic resistance.[E] This paper explores the regulation of the conjugation system in the B. subtilis plasmid pLS20. The authors identify an Xre-type repressor, RcoLS20, as the main transcriptional repressor that keeps the conjugation system off. They demonstrate that RapLS20, a plasmid-encoded anti-repressor, activates conjugation by relieving the repression of RcoLS20. The authors also find that the Phr*LS20 signaling peptide plays a critical role in regulating the timing of conjugation activation. They provide detailed insight into the regulatory circuitry of the pLS20 conjugation system and its implications for bacterial evolution and antibiotic resistance.
10.1371/journal.pntd.0001385	[L] This study investigated how the mosquito Aedes aegypti interacts with the dengue virus (DENV) and how this interaction affects the mosquito's ability to transmit the virus. The researchers identified genes in the mosquito that are involved in the response to DENV infection. They found that different genes are activated in mosquitoes that are susceptible to DENV compared to those that are resistant. They also found that certain pathways, such as the JAK-STAT pathway, are involved in the mosquito's response to the virus. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying DENV infection in mosquitoes, which could lead to the development of new strategies for controlling the spread of dengue fever.[E] This paper presents a genome-wide transcriptome analysis of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in response to dengue virus (DENV) infection. The researchers identified 2,454 DENV responsive genes and demonstrated that these genes interact in well-defined patterns, forming distinct modules. They found that the susceptible and refractory strains of mosquitoes have different gene expression patterns in response to DENV infection, suggesting that the mosquito's ability to transmit the virus is determined by specific pathways and gene networks. The study also revealed the involvement of several important pathways, such as the JAK-STAT pathway, in the mosquito's response to DENV infection. This research provides valuable insights into the molecular basis of DENV-mosquito interactions and could inform the development of novel strategies for controlling dengue fever.
10.1371/journal.pntd.0006750	[L] This study looked at the impact of repeated annual treatment with ivermectin on the parasitic infection loiasis, which is endemic in areas of Africa. The researchers found that after several years of treatment, there was a significant reduction in the prevalence and intensity of the infection. They also found that adherence to the treatment was associated with a lower risk of developing complications from the infection. However, the study also found that a substantial proportion of people in the communities still had the infection, indicating that more work needs to be done to fully eliminate the disease.[E] The study investigated the impact of repeated annual ivermectin treatment on the parasitological indicators of loiasis in areas of onchocerciasis-loiasis co-endemicity in Cameroon. The results showed a marked reduction in the prevalence and intensity of loiasis after several years of treatment.

However, a substantial proportion of the population still had the infection, suggesting that alternative strategies may be needed to fully eliminate the disease. Further research is also needed to develop safe and effective drugs for the treatment of loiasis.
10.1371/journal.pgen.1000810	[L] This paper investigates the impact of head-on collisions between transcription and DNA replication in bacteria. The researchers found that when transcription and replication are running in opposite directions on the same DNA template, it can cause disruptions to the replication process. This disruption is particularly detrimental when it occurs at highly transcribed regions such as rRNA genes. The study also showed that these collisions between transcription and replication can lead to cell death and an increase in mutation rates. The findings suggest that the co-orientation of transcription and replication in the genome has evolved to maintain genome integrity and prevent mutagenesis.[E] The study explores the consequences of head-on collisions between transcription and DNA replication in bacteria. The researchers demonstrate that when transcription and replication travel in opposite directions on the same DNA template, it can lead to a slowdown of replication and even complete blockage at highly transcribed regions such as rRNA genes. This disruption of replication can activate DNA repair processes, but in some cases, it can also result in cell death. The study also reveals that the collision between transcription and replication increases the mutation rate of specific genes, especially when essential genes are affected. These findings shed light on the evolutionary forces that shape genome organization and highlight the importance of co-orientation of transcription and replication for maintaining genome integrity.

10.1371/journal.pntd.0003280	[L] This study looked at a protein called LipL32 in Leptospira bacteria, which causes the disease leptospirosis. The researchers found that LipL32 is modified with chemical groups called methyl groups at specific locations in the bacteria that are found in rats. They also found that these modifications can decrease the immune system's recognition of the protein. These findings suggest that LipL32 modifications may help the bacteria to avoid being attacked by the immune system and could contribute to the bacteria's ability to persist in the body.[E] This paper presents an investigation into the post-translational modifications (PTMs) of the major leptospiral lipoprotein LipL32. The study found that LipL32 in Leptospira bacteria isolated from rats, a major reservoir host of leptospirosis, was modified with methyl groups at specific lysine residues. These modifications were not observed in LipL32 from in vitro-cultured bacteria. The presence of these PTMs may contribute to the bacteria's survival by altering the protein's structure and function, and by reducing immune recognition. The study highlights the potential role of PTMs in bacterial persistence and immune evasion, providing important insights into the pathogenesis of leptospirosis.
10.1371/journal.ppat.1006782	[L] This paper investigates how the immune system is able to remember infections and protect against future ones. The researchers focus on a specific type of immune cell, called CD8 T cells, which are important for fighting infections. They find that these cells can remember different infections at the same time, and that the presence of one infection does not affect the memory response to another infection. However, they also find that certain infections can lead to a decrease in the number of CD8 T cells, which can impact the immune response. Overall, this study helps us understand how the immune system can remember multiple infections and provides insights into the development of vaccines. [E] This paper explores the factors that contribute to the long-term maintenance of T cell memory, specifically effector memory CD8 T cells. The researchers investigate if there is a limit to the number of different infections that can be remembered by the immune system, as well as how pre-existing memory cells can impact the development of new memory cells. They use mouse models of infection with different viruses to study these processes. The results show that the immune system is able to accommodate multiple inflating memory cell populations from unrelated infections, and that the presence of one infection does not impact the size of another infection-specific memory cell population. However, they also find that certain infections can cause a depletion of pre-existing memory cells, which can affect the overall immune response. The study provides valuable insights into how the immune system remembers infections and how this can impact vaccination strategies.
10.1371/journal.pgen.1004098	[L] This paper explores the evolution of sex-specific traits in animals, focusing on the dramatic differences in growth between males and females. The study specifically investigates the development of mandibles in stag beetles and identifies a gene called dsx that plays a major role in sexual differentiation and growth of these traits. The researchers found that dsx gene expression is different between males and females, with male-specific isoforms promoting growth and female-specific isoforms inhibiting growth. Additionally, they discovered that the hormone juvenile hormone (JH) plays a role in mandible growth, but female mandibles are not responsive to JH, suggesting that dsx may be involved in regulating this sensitivity. Overall, the study highlights the complexity of sex-specific trait development and the interplay between genetic and hormonal factors.[E] This paper investigates the developmental mechanisms underlying the growth of sex-specific mandibles in stag beetles.

10.1371/journal.ppat.1007957	[L] Zinc deficiency is a common problem affecting about one third of the world's population. This deficiency can weaken the immune system and make people more susceptible to bacterial infections. In this study, researchers investigated the role of zinc in protecting against pneumococcal infection, which can cause pneumonia. They found that mice on a zinc-restricted diet had higher levels of the bacteria in their lungs and blood, and had a shorter survival time compared to mice on a normal diet. The researchers also found that zinc deficiency affected the ability of immune cells to kill the bacteria. Overall, this study highlights the importance of zinc in protecting against bacterial infections and emphasizes the need for adequate dietary zinc intake.[E] Zinc is a vital nutrient that plays a crucial role in immune function. This study aimed to further understand the mechanisms by which zinc contributes to resistance against bacterial infections, particularly pneumococcal infection. The researchers found that zinc deficiency in mice resulted in higher bacterial burden and increased mortality rates after pneumococcal infection. They observed changes in zinc homeostasis in various tissues, with the lungs showing an increase in zinc levels during infection. Furthermore, zinc deficiency compromised the ability of phagocytic cells to kill the bacteria. These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the link between dietary zinc intake, immune response, and susceptibility to pneumococcal infection.
10.1371/journal.pgen.1006224	[L] This paper discusses the role of downstream antisense transcription in gene regulation. The researchers used a method called Start-seq to identify the locations where antisense transcription starts in human breast cancer cells. They found that these locations coincide with specific genomic features, such as nucleosome positions and histone modifications, associated with active gene expression. Contrary to previous studies, they also found that genes with downstream antisense transcription are not less expressed than genes without this type of transcription. The researchers suggest that downstream antisense transcription may play a role in establishing a specific chromatin environment and can potentially impact gene regulation.[E] This paper investigates the role of downstream antisense transcription in gene regulation. The researchers used Start-seq to identify the locations where antisense transcription initiates in human breast cancer cells. They found that these locations correspond to specific genomic features associated with active gene expression, such as nucleosome positions and histone modifications. Contrary to previous studies, they found that genes with downstream antisense transcription are not repressed and do not display lower expression levels. The researchers propose that downstream antisense transcription may contribute to the establishment of a chromatin environment that supports gene expression and suggest further studies to elucidate the functional significance of this type of transcription.

10.1371/journal.pmed.1002645	[L] This study looked at the effectiveness of a crowdsourced intervention in increasing HIV testing rates among men who have sex with men (MSM) in China. The intervention consisted of a multimedia campaign, an online testing service, and local testing promotion campaigns. The results showed that the crowdsourced intervention significantly increased HIV testing rates among MSM, including an increase in HIV self-testing. This suggests that crowdsourcing can be an effective tool in developing and promoting HIV testing services.[E] This paper presents the findings of a stepped wedge cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) that evaluated the effectiveness of a comprehensive crowdsourced intervention in increasing HIV testing uptake among MSM in China. The intervention was developed through crowdsourcing, utilizing a nationwide open contest, a regional designathon, and local participatory contests to engage the community in shaping the intervention. The results showed that the crowdsourced intervention was effective in increasing HIV testing rates among MSM, with an 8.9% absolute increase in testing during the intervention period compared to the control period. The intervention also increased HIV self-testing rates. These findings highlight the potential of crowdsourcing as a tool for developing and promoting HIV testing services among key populations in low- and middle-income countries.
10.1371/journal.ppat.1007658	[L] This paper discusses the role of a viral protein called A43 in immune evasion during cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. The researchers found that A43 acts as a decoy receptor, blocking the interaction between the protein 2B4 on natural killer (NK) cells and the CD48 protein on infected cells. This prevents NK cells from killing infected cells and reduces their production of immune signaling molecules. The study also found that A43 can inhibit the formation of an immune synapse, a structure necessary for NK cell activation. The authors suggest that A43 may be a useful target for developing therapies to modulate immune responses. [E] This paper investigates the function and mechanism of action of the CMV-encoded protein A43 during infection. The authors demonstrate that A43 acts as a decoy receptor, blocking the interaction between the protein 2B4 on NK cells and the CD48 protein on infected cells. They show that A43 binds with high affinity to 2B4, preventing the activation of NK cells and their killing of infected cells. The authors also find that A43 can inhibit the formation of an immunological synapse between NK cells and infected cells. This study sheds light on how CMV evades the immune response and provides insights into potential therapeutic targets for immune modulation.
10.1371/journal.pbio.1002605	[L] This study investigated the importance of lipid metabolism in the formation of myelin, a crucial component of the nervous system. The researchers found that myelin membrane synthesis depends not only on the lipid synthesis of oligodendrocytes, but also on extracellular lipids provided by astrocytes. When either oligodendrocyte or astrocyte lipid synthesis was compromised, there was a delay in myelin formation. However, the use of a high-fat diet partially rescued this delay in mice with compromised astrocyte lipid metabolism. These findings suggest that astrocytes play a significant role in providing lipids for myelin synthesis and highlight the potential of dietary interventions to improve myelination in certain conditions. [E] This study explored the role of lipid metabolism in myelin formation and function in the central nervous system. The researchers discovered that myelin membrane synthesis relies not only on endogenous lipid synthesis by oligodendrocytes, but also on extracellular lipids provided by astrocytes. They used mouse models with compromised lipid synthesis in either oligodendrocytes or astrocytes to demonstrate that both cell types contribute to myelin membrane synthesis. Additionally, they found that a high-fat diet could partially rescue the delay in myelination caused by compromised astrocyte lipid metabolism. These findings have implications for understanding the mechanisms of myelin formation and provide insights into potential dietary interventions for myelin disorders.

The authors suggest that their approach could lead to further improvements in the field of protein structure prediction.
10.1371/journal.pntd.0002076	[L] Hantaan virus (HTNV) is a virus that causes a severe illness called hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). It is transmitted to humans through infected rodents and can cause outbreaks in Asia, Europe, and North and South America. This study aimed to identify specific immune responses to HTNV in HFRS patients and determine if there is a correlation between these responses and the severity of the disease.

The researchers also observed variations in the response to different epitopes and differences in the activation and proliferation capabilities of CD8+ T cell subsets. These findings contribute to our understanding of the immune response to HTNV infection and have implications for immunotherapy and vaccine development.
10.1371/journal.pntd.0006060	[L] This paper discusses the impact of the Ebola outbreak on the screening and treatment of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), also known as sleeping sickness, in coastal Guinea. HAT is a parasitic disease transmitted by tsetse flies and can be fatal if left untreated. The Ebola outbreak in Guinea led to a significant reduction in HAT screening activities, both through active campaigns and passive detection. As a result, fewer cases were diagnosed and treated during the Ebola period, with a higher proportion of patients being diagnosed at a late stage of the disease. The authors estimate that the Ebola outbreak increased the burden of HAT in Guinea, with an increase in Disability Adjusted Life-Years (DALYs) from 48.7 before Ebola to as high as 466.3 during Ebola. They emphasize the need for targeted vector control measures and the revitalization of screening campaigns to mitigate the impact of future crises and work towards the goal of HAT elimination.[E] This paper investigates the impact of the Ebola outbreak on the screening and treatment of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) in coastal Guinea.
