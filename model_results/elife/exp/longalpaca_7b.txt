This paper discusses how the cerebellum can learn to perform movement sequences using feedback signals from previous movements. The cerebellum can learn to perform a sequence of movements by using feedback signals from the previous movement as a cue to learn the next movement. The paper tested this hypothesis by training rabbits to perform a sequence of eyelid responses using electrical stimulation of mossy fibers as a cue. The results show that when the first eyelid response is elicited by the cue, it can serve as a feedback signal for the cerebellum to learn the next eyelid response. The second eyelid response is associated with the feedback signal from the first response. The cerebellum also uses the timing of the first eyelid response to predict the timing of the second response. The paper shows that the same Purkinje cells are involved in generating the first and second eyelid responses, suggesting the same cerebellar mechanisms are used. The study suggests that feedback signals from previous movements can be used by the cerebellum to learn a sequence of movements.
This paper describes the structure of the human mTORC2 complex, which is a key regulator of cellular growth and metabolism. The authors expressed and purified the core components of human mTORC2 using an expression system called MultiBac, and cryo-electron microscopy was used to visualize the complex. They found that mTORC2 is composed of a dimer of the mTOR and mLST8 subunits, with Rictor and SIN1 as accessory proteins. The structure is similar to that of the yeast TORC2, with the mTOR dimer forming a C2 symmetric complex. The mTOR dimer has a tower-like structure that is stabilized by the Rictor-mTOR interaction, and the SIN1 interaction deepens the active site cleft. The cap region is not well resolved but likely corresponds to the SIN1 interaction with mTOR. The mTORC2 complex shows similar features to mTORC1, including C2 symmetry, Raptor and Rictor interactions, and substrate recruitment. The high flexibility of the accessory proteins limited the resolution of the complex, but the authors were able to obtain a 7.4 Å resolution map of the complete mTORC2 structure with C2 symmetry. The focused refinement of the accessory factors yielded a 6.2 Å resolution map. The paper highlights the similarities and differences between mTORC1 and mTORC2, and the potential reasons for the distinct structures. The authors deposited the cryo-EM maps of the complete mTORC2 structure and the accessory factors in the EMDB database.
The paper investigates the relationship between number perception and space perception in the human brain. The authors show that motion direction can influence number perception, with leftward motion leading to an overestimation of small numbers and rightward motion leading to an underestimation of large numbers. This effect is found to occur in areas of the brain that are involved in processing space, specifically the intraparietal sulcus (IP) and lateral occipital complex (LIP). The authors propose that this cross-adaptation effect is evidence that circuits originally processing space are able to adapt and process number, rather than being fully replaced by number processing circuits. The results suggest that number processing retains its spatial associations and can influence space perception, rather than the two being strictly segregated. The authors propose an opponent coding model that explains the observed cross-adaptation effect, where broadly tuned neurons coding for large and small numbers compete and adaptation leads to a shift in the tuning curves. This model is supported by the observed effects of large adaptor-probe distances and lack of effects for matching the number of dots in the adapter and probe. The findings suggest that number processing and space processing share a common neural basis and that motion can influence number perception through an opponent coding mechanism, which may be useful for identifying children at risk for dyscalculia.
The authors identified a novel mechanism of inhibition by fatty acids of the Musashi-1 (MSI1) RNA-binding protein. They showed that fatty acids with a double bond between 18 and 20 carbons specifically inhibit MSI1 activity. They used a molecular dynamics simulation and docking model to predict that fatty acid binding alters the dynamics of the protein, stabilizing a beta-sheet and altering the position of certain amino acids required for RNA binding. They found that oleic acid, a fatty acid with a double bond between 18 and 20 carbons, inhibits MSI1 by inducing a conformational change that perturbs the position of amino acids required for RNA recognition. They also showed that SCD, an enzyme that catalyzes the ω-9 desaturation reaction, is a MSI1 regulatory target. The results suggest that MSI1 regulates cellular proliferation through a feedback loop involving SCD and its enzymatic products, such as oleic acid. The authors identified oleic acid as the most potent inhibitor and GW747, a PPARalpha agonist, as another inhibitor. They found that SCD expression is increased in MSI1-expressing cells, which correlates with changes in the cellular lipid profile. The results suggest that MSI1 regulates cellular proliferation through a metabolic pathway involving SCD and fatty acid metabolism.
The paper investigates the role of the Ca2+ sensor syt7 in regulating Ca2+-dependent synaptic vesicle replenishment in hippocampal neurons. The authors find that syt7 functions as a Ca2+ sensor that regulates Ca2+-dependent SV replenishment during high-frequency stimulation. They show that syt7 is specifically required for Ca2+-dependent replenishment, but not asynchronous release, by analyzing the recovery of the replenishment ratio after high-frequency stimulation. They find that CaM, a Ca2+-binding protein, interacts with syt7 to regulate the Ca2+-dependent pathway. They propose that the Ca2+ sensor for replenishment consists of a complex formed between syt7 and CaM. The study suggests that syt7 may regulate replenishment by either conveying vesicles from reserve pools or lysosomes, or clearing vesicle release sites. The findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of Ca2+ sensing and signaling in synaptic transmission.
The paper discusses the effects of inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) on stress-related behaviors in mice. The authors found that inhibition of COX-2 activity with either a newly developed substrate-selective COX-2 inhibitor (L-4131) or traditional COX-2 inhibitors (Lumiracoxib, Celecoxib) reduced stress-induced anxiety-like behaviors in mice, including increased feeding latency and conditioned fear expression. The effects were observed in both male and female mice and after both acute and subchronic stress exposure. The authors suggest that the COX-2 inhibitors may act via different mechanisms, including reducing prostaglandin production, enhancing endogenous cannabinoid levels, and/or reducing cellular excitability. In vitro electrophysiology studies showed that L-431 reduced amygdala neuron excitability, which was mimicked by FAAH inhibition. The results suggest that COX-2 inhibition could be a potential therapeutic approach for stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly depression and anxiety.
The paper describes a new method for reconstituting membrane proteins in a detergent-free environment using a peptide called the peptidisc. The peptidisc is made up of multiple copies of an amphipathic peptide that wraps around a target membrane protein, without the need for additional lipids during reconstitution. The peptide design was optimized to stabilize both alpha-helical and beta-barrel membrane proteins of different sizes and complexities. The peptidisc was found to be effective at capturing membrane proteins, retaining their functional properties, and maintaining their stability at high temperatures. The method was tested with various membrane proteins, including FhuA, MalFK2, and the photosynthetic reaction center BRC. The peptidisc was found to be more efficient and cost-effective than traditional scaffold proteins like nanodiscs, and offered advantages like simplicity, stability, and lack of lipid instability. The peptidisc was also able to capture membrane proteins regardless of their initial lipid content.
This paper describes a method called CirSeq for identifying transcript errors in prokaryotes. The method involves circularizing RNA fragments, generating cDNA with tandem repeats, and then sequencing the cDNA to identify transcript errors. The authors applied the method to E. coli, B. subtilis, A. tumefaciens and M. florum. They found that transcript errors are much higher than genetic mutation rates in these species, with M. florum having the highest transcript errors. They also found a bias towards C-U substitutions and an increased frequency of nonsense errors at the 3' end of mRNAs, which suggests the presence of an NMD-like mechanism in prokaryotes. The authors propose that the high concentration of rATPs in prokaryotes may contribute to this bias and that cellular quality control mechanisms may also play a role. They suggest that future research could evaluate the rate at which transcript errors are degraded after initial generation to resolve the major mechanisms involved in transcript error degradation. The CirSeq method was effective in identifying transcript errors and revealed a high transcript error rate in prokaryotes, indicating a potential mechanism of transcript error degradation that differs from eukaryotic NMD.
The paper investigates the relationship between limb usage patterns and cortical reorganization in individuals with unilateral upper limb amputation. The authors found that individuals who rely more on their intact hand for daily tasks exhibit increased activity in the part of the brain that represents the missing hand during intact hand movements, while individuals who rely more on their residual arm exhibit increased activity in the part of the brain that represents the intact hand. This dissociation in cortical representation was found to be present in both congenital and acquired limb loss groups. The authors also found that the degree of intact hand representation in the deprived cortex was related to the degree of residual arm usage, with individuals who incorporated their residual arm more into daily tasks showing reduced intact hand activity in the deprived cortex. The findings demonstrate that adaptive plasticity in the adult brain is driven by the usage strategies adopted by individuals rather than age at deprivation, and that the deprived cortex is employed by the part of the body that individuals rely on more to compensate for their disability. The study sheds light on the scope for adult brain plasticity in individuals with unilateral limb loss and may inspire future rehabilitation approaches that target both residual and intact arms.
The paper investigates the early evolution of long bone elongation and bone marrow in tetrapods, specifically in stem tetrapods and amphibians. The authors examine the limb bones of three stem tetrapods (Apedis, Acanthostega, and Metoposaurus) and two amphibians (Seymouria and Discosaurus) using 3D virtual histology and thin section analysis. They find that stem tetrapods likely elongated their long bones through globuli ossei, while amphibians elongated through a columnar growth plate. The bone marrow processes in the amphibians open up into multilocular spaces in the trabecular mesh of the metaphysis, while those in the tetrapods open directly into the bone shaft. The authors propose that the bone marrow processes in tetrapods likely only played a role in initiating endochondral ossification for elongation of the limb bone but not in haematopoiesis. The study suggests that haematopoies likely migrated into bone marrow in amphibians after they ventured onto land, not in the earliest tetrapods. The findings provide new insights into the evolutionary history of long bone elongation and bone marrow and their role in tetrapod evolution.
The paper discusses how alcohol consumption and stress can lead to maladaptive stress responses in the brain. Long-term alcohol drinking and withdrawal experiences result in heightened responsiveness to stressors, which can contribute to relapse. The paper shows that dysregulation of cortical inputs to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) may underlie this maladaptive stress response. The BST is known to mediate negative affective states and anxiety-like behaviors. The authors demonstrate that KOR signaling in the BNST regulates behavioral responses to stress during protracted alcohol abstinence, specifically the lack of burying behavior in response to a predator odor. They identify that increased c-Fos expression and Pdyn expression in the BNST after alcohol drinking and stress exposure. This suggests that increased KOR signaling in the BNST may underlie the maladaptive stress responses. The authors also show that intra-BNST norBNI infusions and genetic deletion of BNSTPDYN neurons normalize alcohol-induced impairments in behavioral responses to stressors during protracted abstinence. The results suggest that KOR signaling in the BNST is a critical pharmacological target for treating alcohol use disorders. The findings highlight that increased corticolimbic connectivity may underlie the dysregulation of corticolimbic-driven stress neuropeptide signaling during alcohol withdrawal, and that altered mPFC-BNST connectivity may serve as a potential biomarker for negative outcomes.
The paper describes a study on the protein eEF1A, also known as eRF1A, which is involved in the heat shock response. The authors found that eEF1A regulates the expression of heat shock proteins HSP70 by recruiting the transcription factor HSF1 to the HSP70 promoter and activating its transcription. eEF1A also interacts directly with the 3' untranscribed region of HSP70 mRNA and stabilizes it, which facilitates its transport from the nucleus to the cytoplasm for translation. The loss of eEF1A leads to reduced HSP70 expression and thermotolability, indicating that eEF1A is required for the synchronized and robust expression of HSP70. The authors propose that eEF1A could be a target for therapies aimed at diseases associated with dysregulated heat shock response, such as spinal muscular atrophy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
This paper explores a mechanism for how auxin regulates flower development in plants. Auxins are involved in initiating flower primordia from the shoot apex, but how auxin signaling is translated into gene expression is poorly understood. The authors find that auxin regulates flower development by recruiting chromatin remodeling complexes, specifically the SWI/SNF ATPases BRM and SYD, to target loci that are repressed by auxin-sensitive Aux/IAA proteins. These chromatin remodeling complexes unlock compacted chromatin, allowing additional transcription factors to access their binding sites and recruit the general transcriptional machinery, leading to flower initiation. They show that SWI/SNF ATPases are essential for flower initiation and that Aux/IAA proteins prevent this recruitment by the chromatin remodeling complexes. This study uncovers a simple and general mechanism for how auxin signaling can rapidly and precisely control chromatin state changes to change cell identities and support diverse transcriptional and cell fate outcomes.
The paper discusses how a mouse model was generated with a 2 Mb deletion of a genomic segment that is syntenic to a human chromosome 7q2 segment, which is frequently deleted in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients. The mouse model exhibited hematopoietic abnormalities, including a bias towards myeloid lineages, impaired lymphoid repopulating potential, and a pronounced expansion of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells with age. The authors conclude that the 7q2 deletion likely contributes to MDS pathogenesis by impairing lymphoid differentiation and modestly enhancing the growth of GATA2 mutant hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. The deletion affected multiple genes involved in mitochondrial function and oxidative phosphorylation, which may contribute to the hematopoietic abnormalities. The results provide evidence that segmental genomic deletions, like 7q2, can cooperate with other mutations to drive myeloid transformation and progression to acute myeloid leukemia.
This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the molecular classification of somatosensory neurons in the mouse. The authors used cell-type specific transcriptomics to identify three major somatosensory neuron populations, which were then analyzed at the single cell level using parallel RT-PCR. They found that each population had distinct expression patterns of genes that correlated with their functional specialization, including ion channels, neurotrophic receptors and G-protein coupled receptors. They identified at least six novel neuronal subgroups at the single cell level that were not captured by the binary classification of IB4 or IB4 staining. The analysis revealed new markers for non-peptidergic nociceptor, proprioceptor and pruriceptive neurons, and a pruritic neuron population that expressed IL31ra and Nppb. The study demonstrates the complexity of somatosensory neurons and highlights the need for more granular analysis at the single cell level to fully understand their molecular identity and function.
The paper describes the functions of the ZHP1/2 and ZHP3/4 RING finger proteins in regulating crossover formation during meiosis in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. The authors found that these proteins, which are homologous to RNF12 and HEI10 in other organisms, localize to the synaptonemal complex and synapsis initiation complex, restrict pro-crossover factors to a single recombination intermediate on each homolog, and promote their accumulation at a subset of sites, thereby limiting the number of recombination intermediates and ensuring proper chromosome segregation. They showed that ZHP1/2 are required for restricting pro-crossover factors to a single site, while ZHP3/4 are required for stabilizing these factors at that site. The ZHP proteins also regulate chromosome remodeling in response to crossover designation, with ZHP1/2 promoting the accumulation of PLK2 along one chromosome arm and ZHP3/4 depleting SC proteins from the corresponding site. The ZHP proteins function as a heterodimeric complex, with ZHP1/2 promoting the accumulation of ZHP3/4 at recombination intermediates. The study suggests that a biochemical signaling cascade within the synaptonemal complex mediates the regulation of crossover formation and chromosome remodeling, with the ZHP proteins acting upstream of other regulators. The ZHP proteins are required for the asymmetric localization of PLK2 along chromosomes, which is important for chromosome remodeling. The findings support the idea that CO regulation is mediated through a liquid crystalline material within the synaptonemal complex.
The paper presents a study on how proteolysis and phosphatase activity regulate the events of mitotic exit in mammalian cells. The authors used high-resolution mass spectrometry and live cell imaging to investigate the dephosphorylation of key regulatory proteins during mitotic exit. They found that the graded series of dephosphorylations is encoded into the system based on the individual phosphate sites, with early sites dephosphorylating more rapidly than later sites. The destruction of the key protein cyclin B1 triggers the graded dephosphory, which in turn activates the APC/C to degrade regulatory phosphatases. The APC/C inhibition does not affect the order in which the dephosphorylations occur. The authors propose that the bulk of mitotic exit is triggered by the destruction of the protein cyclin B1, which in turn activates the APC/C. The APC/C inhibition does not prevent the dephosphorylation, but instead stabilizes the cellular state to allow the APC/C to degrade regulatory proteins and reset the cell cycle. The study suggests that dephosphorylation, rather than proteolysis, determines the order of events during anaphase, and that the preference for phospho-threon sites in the APC/C holoenzymes determines the order of events.
This paper investigates the role of a gene called Wfs1 in the prefrontal cortex of the brain in response to stress. The authors found that Wfs1 is expressed in superficial layer 2/3 pyramidal cells in the prefrontal cortex, particularly in the medial prefrontal cortex, and hippocampus. When Wfs1 expression is deleted from these cells, mice become more sensitive to stress-induced depressive behaviors, such as increased immobility in forced swim tests and decreased sucrose preference. The authors also found that loss of Wfs1 in these cells leads to altered endoplasmic reticulum function, specifically in the release of growth factors and neurotrophins. The authors conclude that Wfs1 is required in the prefrontal cortex to regulate the response to stress and normal function of these cells. They suggest that dysfunction in Wfs1-expressing cells in the prefrontal cortex may contribute to the development of depression.
The paper discusses how protein function is regulated through different levels of modulation, including site-specific mutations, cochaperone binding, and macro-molecular crowding. The authors investigate how these different modulations affect the conformational dynamics and function of the protein Hsp90. They find that all three modulations result in similar steady-state distributions, but have different kinetic effects. The point mutation A57I destabilizes the open conformation and leads to a stiffened structure, while macro-molecular crowding stabilizes the closed conformation by sterical confinement. The cochaperone Aha1 combines both mechanisms with additional rearrangements. The authors conclude that the reduction of non-productive structural flexibility stimulates Hsp90's ATPase function through conformational combinatorics, and that conformational confinement by localized or global modulations is an important mechanistic concept with wide-spread implications for protein function. They also find that macro-molecular crowding has strong thermodynamic, kinetic and functional effects, which could be missed in vitro. The paper demonstrates that protein function is regulated through a dynamic structure-function relationship and that conformational combinatorics plays an important role in protein regulation.
The study finds that competition between polarity clusters is the main mechanism that enforces the rule that most cells develop only one front or bud. The authors used a variety of experiments to test this hypothesis. They found that slowing the exchange of polarity factors between the polarity clusters and the cell interior allowed cells to form more than one bud, demonstrating that the presence of a competing cluster is necessary to eliminate excess clusters. The study suggests that cells have sufficient polarity factors to make multiple functional buds, but the competitive process ensures that only one bud is allowed to persist. The authors propose that this competition is driven by the insatiable nature of the process, where the winning cluster starves the losing clusters of polarity factors. This competition has parallels with coarsening phenomena in physics. The study argues that similar competition between polarity clusters may occur in other situations in cells that generate a single front, such as plant root hairs.
This paper reports experiments using single-molecule FRET to demonstrate that RecA filaments, which are involved in homologous recombination, can slide along DNA strands to assist in homology search during strand exchange reactions. The RecA filament slides along the DNA strands by electrostatic interactions, rather than through full dissociation and rebinding. The experiments show that RecA filaments can recognize a homologous sequence during sliding, and this allows for rapid homology recognition and base pairing. Adding even a single nucleotide of complementary base pairs to a minimum recognition unit of 6 nucleotides is sufficient for homology recognition. The ability of RecA filaments to slide between nearby homology sites during sliding could serve as a mechanism to rapidly scan neighboring sequences for the existence of an optimal sequence for base pairing and heteroduplex extension reactions. The study establishes that sliding along DNA strands, combined with intersegmental transfer, can dramatically accelerate homology search, and search by RecA filaments. The results provide an example of a multi-protein complex bound to DNA that can slide along DNA strands to locate a matching sequence of bases.
The paper describes the crystal and solution structures of the protein M2-1 from the human metapneumovirus HMPV. The protein has a zinc finger and tetramerization domain and is involved in antitermination of viral mRNA transcription. The authors found that the protein exists in both open and closed conformations and that the closed state is stabilized by binding to adenosine bases in the zinc finger. The adenine recognition is specific and the closed state is coupled with the formation of higher order oligomers. The authors propose a model of gene end recognition by M2-1, where the zinc finger recognizes adenine base 5 and the core domain recognizes the polyadenosine tract. The closed state is also coupled with protein-protein interactions that prevent protein aggregation. The results provide insights into the mechanism of antitermination in the Pneumovirinae family of viruses and the role of M2-1 in viral morphogenesis.
The paper describes the first quantitative imaging of lysosomal chloride in vivo in Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes and mammalian cells using DNA-based fluorescent sensors. They show that lysosomes in nematodes are highly enriched in chloride compared to extracellular chloride levels, and that lysosomal chloride dysregulation correlates with loss of degradative function of the lysosome. In nematode models of lysosomal storage disorders, lysosomal chloride is significantly depleted. In mammalian cell culture models of lysosomal storage diseases, lysomes are found to have higher chloride levels compared to extracellular chloride concentrations. Decreasing lysomal chloride impedes the release of calcium from the lysome, suggesting an interplay between chloride and calcium ions in the lysome. The ability to quantitate lysomal chloride enables investigations into the broader mechanistic roles of chloride ions in regulating lysome function. Decrease in lysomal chloride impedes the degradative function of the lysome, indicating that chloride dysregulation may have more widespread roles in regulating lysome function beyond just countering lysomal proton levels.
The paper explores the neural mechanisms that allow monkeys to use head gaze to shift attention to the location of an observed conspecific's gaze. The authors trained monkeys to use head orientation to identify a spatial target while ignoring head orientation. They found that a specific patch of brain activity in the posterior superior temporal sulcus was associated with gaze following behavior, which was found to be unilateral in one of the two monkeys. This patches was distinct from face-selective patches in the same region. The authors propose that this gaze following patch corresponds to the pSTS region in humans, which is devoted to eye following and is the substrate of the calculations needed to translate head orientation into precise shifts of attention. The results suggest that the neural mechanisms for eye following in monkeys and humans are homologous, with the gaze following patch in monkeys corresponding to the pSTS region in humans.
The paper investigates how monocular deprivation, or deprivation of one eye in early life, affects visual function in mice. The authors find that long-term monocular deprivation causes significant loss of visual acuity and reduced responsiveness in the visual cortex, with slow recovery in adulthood, even after reopening the deprived eye. They use intrinsic signal imaging and single cell recordings to show that locomotion, or running on a treadmill, enhances recovery of visual responses in the deprived eye, particularly to the specific visual stimuli experienced during running. This enhancement is specific to the stimuli presented during locomotion, not just general increases in neural activity. The study suggests that enhancement of visual function through locomotion may be due to the active state induced by running, which facilitates plasticity. The results suggest that enhancement of visual function in adulthood may involve decreased intracortical inhibition, consistent with the observed changes in broad-spiking and narrow-spiking neuron activity.
The paper describes the results of a study on how leaf-cutting ants and their fungal cultivars cooperate to degrade plant material. The ants produce fecal fluid containing enzymes that help degrade plant material, while the fungi produce enzymes that produce hydrogen peroxide to break down cellulose. The enzymes in the fecal fluid produce hydroxyl radicals, which are used to break down cellulose. The ants produce glucose dehydrogenase to reduce iron back to iron, while the fungi produce aryl alcohol oxidases to produce hydrogen peroxide. The iron concentration in the fecal fluid is high enough to allow the Fenton chemistry to occur. The paper finds that the enzymes in the fecal fluid are mostly fungal and serve the ant-fungal symbiosis. The fecal fluid contains hydrogen peroxide, iron, and glucose dehydrogenase, which are all necessary for the Fenton chemistry. The ants and fungi thus cooperate to produce hydroxyl radicals that degrade plant material. The ants do not directly add fecal fluid to existing Fenton pellets, but instead collect and concentrate it in droplets before distributing it. This compartmentalizes the potentially harmful hydroxyl radicals. The paper suggests that the ability to use inorganic chemistry has evolved to help the ants become efficient herbivores.
The paper investigates the role of Greatwall (GWL) in cell transformation and tumour growth. The authors found that GWL overexpression promotes cell transformation in immortalised cell lines and primary human fibroblasts, as well as invasiveness in cancer cell lines. GWL overexpression was found to increase AKT phosphorylation on S473, which in turn promoted cell proliferation, migration and anchorage-independent growth. The authors show that GWL overexpression leads to decreased PHLPP levels, which in turn activates AKT and promotes cell transformation. They propose that GWL may phosphorylate another protein to activate GSK3 and induce PHLPP degradation, leading to AKT phosphorylation on S47. The study suggests that GWL represents a potential tumour marker and target for future therapeutic approaches.
The paper discusses the impact of the new anti-tuberculosis drug bedaquiline (BDQ) on human macrophages. The authors found that BDQ does not affect the immune response in the same way as other anti-TB drugs. While other anti-TB drugs increase autophagy and phagosome-lysosome fusion, BDQ instead induces a metabolic reprogramming of macrophages, increasing acidic compartments and proteolytic activity. BDQ specifically upregulates genes involved in lysosome biogenesis and acidification. BDQ activates the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor EB, which in turn activates autophagy and lysosomal genes. BDQ-treated macrophages are able to better control Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, showing that BDQ enhances macrophage innate immune defense mechanisms. BDQ also potentiates the activity of other anti-TB drugs. The study suggests that BDQ may be useful in host-directed therapy, which could help combat the growing number of bacteria resistant to existing antibiotics.
The authors investigated how the Hippo signaling pathway, specifically the transcription factor YAP, regulates lung development. They found that YAP is expressed throughout the lung epithelium and regulates the expression of genes that control cell proliferation and mechanical force production. They used conditional alleles of YAP to inactivate YAP in specific parts of the lung epithelium and observed that loss of YAP in the distal airway leads to cystic lung phenotypes, while loss of YAP in the proximal airway did not affect branching or cell types. They propose that disruption of local epithelial properties, rather than changes in cell type specification, underlies the cystic phenotypes. They identified new targets of YAP that regulate pMLC levels and cellular contractility, and found that reduced pMLC levels disrupt mechanical force production. They propose that YAP regulates multiple pathways to control pMLC generation and that dynamic changes in cellular properties are required for lung development. The work provides new insights into how YAP controls lung development and how Hippo signaling executes lung patterning.
The paper describes the first visualization of injectisomes from Yersinia enterocolitica and Shigella flexneri inside intact bacterial cells. The injectisomes were visualized using cryo-electron microscopy and structure was determined using cryo-electron tomography, X-ray crystallography, and molecular dynamics simulations. The results show that the basal body of the injectisomes is significantly longer in the intact bacteria than expected from isolated structures, suggesting that tertiary structure elasticity allows the injectisomes to cope with membrane stresses. The elongation of the basal body is found to be anisotropic, with the secretin YscC contributing the most to the elongation. The injectisomes were found to have an extended periplasmic domain that is similar in size to that of the homologous bacterial flagellar motors, despite the different in situ and isolated structures. The authors propose that the elasticity of the basal body allows the injectisomes to adapt to changes in the periplasmic space and membrane tension, providing a mechanism for membrane protection.
This paper investigates the role of the FER (FER) receptor kinase in plant development and growth. FER is an important regulator of female fertility and participates in various signaling pathways. The authors find that FER interacts with two related GPI-anchored proteins, LRE and LLG1, which are required for FER localization to the cell membrane. Loss of LLG1 or LRE leads to similar growth and developmental defects as loss of FER, indicating that LLG1/LRE are essential for FER function. The authors propose a model where FER interacts with LRE in the ER, and then co-localizes with LRE in the cell membrane as a GPI-anchored complex that mediates ROS-dependent signaling. LLG1 and LRE are also shown to physically interact with FER on the membrane. The results demonstrate that GPI-anchored proteins like LLG1/LRE provide versatility for FER to regulate different signaling pathways and functions. The findings provide insight into how FER localizes to the cell membrane and mediates its multiple biological roles, and highlight the importance of GPI-anchored proteins as signaling regulators.
This paper compares the chromatin structure and nucleosome occupancy in the archaeon Haloferax volcanii with that of eukaryotes. The authors find that while the histones in Haloferax volcanii are similar to eukaryotic histones, the nucleosomes are shorter and have a different periodicity due to the smaller genome size. They construct a genome-wide nucleosome occupancy map of Haloferax volcanii using micrococal nuclease digestion of crosslinked chromatin, RNA-seq, and computational methods. They show that nucleosome midpoints are enriched with G/C nucleotides and depleted with A/T nucleotides, consistent with previous studies. They also find that nucleosome-depleted regions (NDRs) are conserved at transcriptional start sites (TSSs) and terminations (TTSs), indicating that the interplay between chromatin and transcription is similar in archaea and eukaryotes. However, the nucleosome occupancy profiles are shorter in Haloferax volcanii due to the smaller genome size. This suggests that while histones and chromatin architecture likely arose before the divergence of Archaea and Eukarya, higher-order chromatin structures may have evolved independently in eukaryotes. The authors propose that archaeal chromatin is necessary but not sufficient for genome compaction, while eukaryotic chromatin is required but not sufficient. The study provides a rich dataset to investigate the evolution of chromatin and its role in gene expression regulation.
The paper discusses the role of serotonin signaling in Drosophila melanogaster in determining the value of dietary protein and its impact on aging. The authors used a new continuous feeding monitor called the Fly Liquid-food Interaction Counter (FLIC) to measure protein preference in flies that were starved and then provided with protein or sugar. They found that serotin signaling through the 5HT2a receptor is required for protein preference in starved flies. Serotin signaling also influenced aging in a macronutrient valuation context, independent of overall caloric intake. They identified the amino acid transporter JhI-21 as a key upstream regulator of serotin signaling. They showed that serotin signaling is required during the post-ingestive phase and acts acutely to induce behavioral and physiological responses. They also found that serotin signaling modulates aging independently of mechanisms that regulate reproduction and total food intake. The results suggest that the macronutrient valuation process itself is a potent factor that modulates organismal aging, possibly through an integration of sensory perception and internal evaluation of nutrient demand.
The paper presents an analysis of the transcriptome of 50 pairs of kidney cancer (ccRCC) tumor and normal tissue samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TGA). The study shows that transcription read-through, which occurs when RNA polymerase II extends beyond the annotated gene boundaries, is a common feature of ccRCC, and is associated with poor patient survival. The most frequently mutated gene, SETD2, is found to be involved in the read-through defects, and its ectopic expression can rescue the transcription termination defects of SETD2-mutant ccRCC cells. The study also shows that the effects of impaired transcription termination extend beyond the affected gene, contaminating the expression of neighboring genes. The correlation between transcription read-through and the expression of the anti-apoptotic oncogene BCL2 suggests a new mechanism of aberrant expression of cancer-related genes. The study also reveals recurrent RNA chimeras, which are generated from intergenic splicing following a read-through event, and are recurrently detected in multiple tumor samples. The findings suggest that the widespread incidence of aberrant termination in ccRCC may play an important role in expanding the transcriptome diversity that drives cancer development and progression, and that chimeric transcripts may produce functional oncoproteins. However, further studies are needed to fully elucidate the impact of impaired transcription termination on cancer.
The paper describes the interaction between Glycoprotein Lipase LPL and Glycoprotein B1 (GPIB1). GPIB1 is essential for the lipolytic processing of triglycerides along capillaries. The authors show that GPIB1 contains an intrinsically disordered N-terminal acidic domain that plays a key role in binding to LPL. The acidic domain has a major effect on the association rate constant for the GPIB1•LPL interaction and stabilizes the LPL catalytic domain, preventing unfolding of the catalytic domain. The LPL•GPIB complex has two discrete interaction sites that cooperate to promote ligand binding and stabilization of LPL activity. The authors propose a model where the acidic domain plays an important role in mobilizing heparin-bound LPL within interstitial spaces, driving LPL into association with endothelial cells. The paper provides insights into the mechanism of LPL mobilization by GPIB1, which could help structure determination of LPL by X-ray crystallography. The acidic domain stabilizes the interdomain interface of LPL, limiting protein dissociation and unfolding of the partner monomers of an LPL homodimer. The authors suggest that incubating LPL with peptides derived from GPIB1's acidic domain could promote stabilization of LPL, increase its conformational homogeneity, and enhance the likelihood of growing well-diffracting crystals.
The paper describes a study on the structure and function of the Escherichia coli RNA polymerase transcription initiation complex. The authors used cryo-electron microscopy to examine the structure of the TraR-Eσ70 complex, which is a complex of TraR, σ70, and RNA polymerase. They found that TraR binds to β-Si1 and β-Si3 in a way that weakens interactions between σ701 and the main channel, allowing σ701 ejection during transcription initiation. TraR also induces conformational changes in RNA polymerase that alter σ701 interactions, allowing σ701 ejection. These effects occur at activated promoters, but not inhibited promoters. The results suggest that TraR alters the energy landscape of transcription initiation, allowing more efficient transcription from activated promoters. The study proposes a model of TraR function that involves weakening σ701 interactions, dissociation from the complex, and blocking NTP access to the active site. The model accounts for the effects of TraR on transcription activation and inhibition across different promoters.
This paper investigates the neural mechanisms through which ghrelin, a hormone that stimulates appetite, controls feeding behavior. The authors show that ghrelin secreted in anticipation of food stimulates the ventral hypothalamic area (LHA) through its receptors in the ventral hypothalamic nucleus, specifically vascular hypothalamic neurons (vHP). This neural pathway activates orexin-expressing neurons in the LHA, which in turn increases appetite and feeding behavior. The vHP-LHA pathway is shown to be necessary for ghrelin-mediated hyperphagia, as blocking this pathway eliminates ghrelin-induced hyperphagia. The authors also demonstrate that ghrelin signaling in the LHA, while not as relevant for conditioned feeding, likely plays a role in non-conditioned appetitive feeding behavior. The study highlights the novel neural circuit through which ghrelin from the stomach communicates with the central nervous system to control feeding behavior, specifically the vHP-LHA pathway.
The paper discusses the dynamics of a dengue fever outbreak in Fiji in 2013/2014. The authors used a combination of laboratory-confirmed case reports and serological survey data to investigate the transmission dynamics and evaluate the role of climate and control measures in the outbreak. They found that the majority of infections occurred in the 20-29 age group, although surveillance data showed the highest per capita level of reported disease in that age group. The ELISA results suggested that fewer than 50% of individuals under age 20 had been infected. Serological surveys provided insights into age-specific patterns of infection that were not captured by seroprevalence thresholds alone, and found that self-reported symptoms were associated with DENV infection. A model fitting both surveillance and serological data found that seasonal variation in transmission and herd immunity alone could not explain the decline in transmission in 2014, but an additional reduction in transmission in March 2014 coinciding with a nationwide clean-up campaign likely contributed to the observed patterns. The model suggested that the effective reproduction number during the outbreak was around 1.2. The results demonstrate the benefits of combining serological and surveillance data for modeling dengue transmission dynamics and provide insights into the potential factors that influenced the outbreak.
The paper presents evidence that African trypanosomes, which lack glutathione-dependent peroxidases, have a trypanothione-based redox metabolism in both the cytosol and mitochondria. The authors generated novel biosensors, Tpx-roGFP2 and roGFP2-hGrx1, that specifically respond to the trypanothione redox state in the cytosol and mitochondria. The biosensors showed that the trypanothione redox potential in the mitochondria is slightly lower than in the cytosol. Depletion of the mitochondrial thiol peroxidase mPrx resulted in a decrease in the ability of the parasites to cope with exogenous oxidants, indicating that mPrx is the key peroxidase that couples hydrogen peroxide reduction to trypanothione oxidation in the mitochondria. The study provides evidence that the mitochondria harbors a trypanothione-based thiol metabolism, but the reducing capacity is lower than in the cytosol. The authors propose that a small fraction of cytosolic Tpx may be present in the mitochondria and that another oxidoreductase may transfer electrons between the trypanothione redox couple and the mitochondrial thiol peroxidases.
The paper investigates the role of DNA methylation in Paget's disease of bone (PDB). Methylation profiles from PDB patients were compared to controls and meta-analysis of discovery and cross-validation revealed 14 genome-wide significant differentially methylated sites (DMS) and differentially methylated regions (DMR). Many were located within or near genes with functional relevance to PDB pathogenesis, including bone-related functions and environmental triggers associated with PDB. The study identified 95 differentially methylated sites that had the highest predictive ability when tested on a validation set, indicating the potential for these sites as biomarkers for PDB susceptibility. The study highlights genes involved in immune responses, cell cycle, cytoskeleton organization and bone metabolism. The findings suggest that epigenetic markers, possibly combined with genetic profiling, could be used to assess risk of developing PDB in people with a family history of the disorder so that early intervention could be considered where clinically appropriate. However, the identified methylation changes were not shown to occur in osteoclasts, the main cells of interest in PDB pathogenesis, and more research is needed to determine their effect on gene expression.
The paper describes the identification of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the early first instar larval lymph gland of Drosophila. Previous studies had shown that hematopoiesis in Drosophila begins in the posterior signaling center (PSC), but the HSCs were thought to be absent in the early larval lymph gland. The authors discovered that there are a small number of HSCs in the first instar lymph gland that express Notch, STAT, and homothax. These HSCs are found next to the dorsal vessel and depend on the PSC for maintenance. The authors found that the PSC releases a signal called Dpp that is required for HSC maintenance. They showed that loss of Dpp signaling in the first 18 hours after hatching leads to loss of HSCs, while loss of the niche cells does not affect the PSC number. This indicates that the HSCs are transient and depend on the PSC for maintenance. The identification of HSCs in the early larval lymph gland provides a new model for understanding the development and maintenance of AGM-related HSCs, which is more similar to the vertebrate model. The authors propose that the larval lymph gland can be used to study early HSC expansion, division, and genetic dissection of the mechanisms that distinguish arterial and hematopoietic fates. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms regulating early HSC development and offers avenues for studying developmental hematopoies, which may have implications for stem cell therapy.
The paper describes a study on the molecular mechanisms of alveolar formation during lung development. The authors found that a Wnt5a-Ror2-Vangl2 axis controls the secretion of PDGF ligands from alveolar type I and type II cells to fibroblasts/myofibblasts, which promotes their proliferation and migration. This is necessary for the formation of secondary septa and alveoli. They found that loss of the Wnt5a-Ror2 axis in alveolar epithelial cells or mesenchyme disrupts the ability of fibroblasts/myofibblasts to secrete PDGF ligands and results in defective alveolar formation. They identified that morphological changes in alveolar type I cells are also critical for secondary septa formation. The study provides new insights into how the Wnt5a-Ror2-Vangl2 axis operates in both the lung epithelium and mesenchyme and controls distinct aspects of cellular properties required for alveogenesis. They propose that this axis controls cell shape changes in both alveolar cells and myofibroblasts, and that the actin cytoskeleton plays a key role in mediating these cellular properties. The findings suggest that the developmental programs executed by the Wnt5a-Ror2-Vangl2 axis are utilized for tissue repair in the lung, and may contribute to diseases such as bronchopulitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
The paper discusses the role of tRNA aminoacylation editing in preventing the incorporation of non-proteogenic amino acids into proteins during translation. The authors investigate the editing activity of the E. coli tRNA aminoacylation enzyme (PheRS) and its role in preventing the incorporation of methionine into proteins during oxidative stress conditions. They find that E. coli PheRS is able to efficiently edit methionine-tRNA, but this editing activity is essential for cellular growth and survival under oxidative stress conditions. The authors show that the lack of methionine-tRNA editing in yeast leads to the accumulation of methionine in proteins, which is cytotoxic. In contrast, yeast PheRS is mainly edited at the cognate position, reflecting differences in the factors that drive quality control mechanisms between the two organisms. The results suggest that non-proteinogenic amino acids pose a substantial challenge for protein synthesis quality control and that the editing of non-cognate amino acids by tRNA synthetases may be essential under conditions that lead to their accumulation. The study highlights the importance of tRNA editing in maintaining the proper functioning of the translation machinery and demonstrates that the incorporation of non-proteinogenic amino acids into proteins can have cellular effects that are codon-dependent.
The paper investigates how the extracellular matrix (ECM) influences the formation of taenidial folds in the trachea of Drosophila melanogaster. The ECM provides a supracellular structure that instructs cells to organize their actin filaments in a specific way, which in turn shapes the chitin synthesis and deposition in the trachea. The actin rings in the trachea prefigure the taenidial folds, and the taenidial folds run parallel or perpendicular to the tube axis depending on the orientation of the actin bundles. The authors found that genes involved in actin organization, like tal/pri and Blimp-1, affect chitin deposition, and chitin deposition in turn affects actin bundling. They also found that tracheal cells are able to sense a global cue and align their actin bundles appropriately even when their continuity is disrupted at the cell-cell junction level. They propose a model where chitin synthesis feedbacks on actin organization via Src2A phosphorylation, which in turn stabilizes actin bundles. This feedback mechanism is necessary for the formation of the supracellular taenidial structures that expand the tracheal tube. The results suggest that cell-cell junctions are central to ensuring continuity of intracellular actin bundles as a patterning element for the overall tube, and that chitin deposition feeds back on cellular architecture via the modulation of Src2A phosphorylation.
The paper critiques the models proposed by Hyafil and Moreno-Bote that attempt to explain hierarchical decision-making in the visual cortex using a flat model with multiple accumulators. The authors find that these models fail to account for several aspects of the behavioral and neurophysiological data. The models assume that evidence at the higher level is only influenced by evidence at the lower level, but the data shows that evidence at the higher level can influence the lower level. The models also assume that evidence accumulation is serial, but the data shows that evidence can accumulate in parallel. The authors conclude that flat models lack the flexibility to account for hierarchical decision-making tasks, as they require a single accumulator for each configuration of successive decisions. The paper also shows that humans can accumulate evidence in parallel when task complexity increases, while the models require multiple accumulators. The authors argue that understanding the neuronal mechanisms that enable hierarchical decision-making will require studying neurons with persistent activity and focusing on the mechanisms that improve interactions between successive decisions.
The paper investigates how humans represent and generalize information from probabilistic reward-guided learning tasks. The authors find that during such tasks, stimuli with high payout probability share a neural code with larger numbers, while stimuli with lower value share a neural code with lower numbers. They propose that an abstract neural code for magnitude forms a conceptual basis set or "scaffold" for learning new information, allowing new relational structures to be learned more quickly and effectively. This neural code is aligned with the mental number line, which is a conceptual representation of magnitude that humans recycle to encode reward probabilities. The authors simulate this using a neural network and find that shared structure between stimuli facilitates retraining, even for stimuli with different physical input features. The neural code is found to be low-dimensional but not simply univariate, and the authors suggest that the shared structure can promote generalization and faster learning. However, the true dimensionality of the shared code remains unclear due to the limited spatial resolution of EEG data.
The paper discusses how Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium uses acidification to activate its pathogenicity genes, specifically the SPI-2 island genes that encode type-3 secretion systems and effectors. The authors investigate how the two regulatory proteins SsrA and SsrB are involved in this process. They find that acidification leads to an increase in the levels of SsrA and SsrB proteins, which in turn leads to increased expression of SPI-2 genes. Higher levels of SsrB proteins are observed in acidic conditions, and the DNA binding affinity of SsrB is increased, allowing it to bind to DNA more efficiently. They propose that the conformational change in acidic conditions is the key factor in this process. SsrB binding to DNA is also found to be more efficient in acidic conditions, but not a conserved feature of response regulators.
The paper describes the development of an optogenetic system to specifically activate the Ras-RalB signaling pathway in cells, which was used to investigate the role of RalB in driving cell invasion and metastasis. The system uses a light-gated protein-interaction module based on the interaction between a cryptochrome and a ras protein to selectively activate RalB at the plasma membrane. By locally activating RalB, the authors found that it promotes cell edge dynamics and protrusion formation, leading to increased cell invasion. They showed that RalB is required for invasion in the context of oncogenic K-Ras mutations, while MAPK and PI3K pathways are not necessary. The results suggest that the RalB pathway is a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment, especially in cases where RalB is overexpressed or amplified. The authors also found that RalB expression increases with disease progression in breast cancer tumors, consistent with a role for RalB in cancer invasion and metastasis. The study provides evidence that the RalB pathway may be a dominant driver of invasion in certain contexts, contradicting previous assumptions that MAPK and PI3K are key.
The paper presents a detailed analysis of how side-binding proteins affect actin filament dynamics, using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. The study shows that side-binding proteins can alter the elongation kinetics and pausing behavior of actin filaments at both the barbed and pointed ends. The barbed end elongates faster and has a higher critical concentration for polymerization compared to the pointed end. The pointed end exhibits more pauses and has a lower critical concentration for polymerization. The paper proposes that the pointed end is in a non-elongating state and that side-binding proteins alter the structure of the filament to modulate its kinetics. The experiments demonstrate that different side-binding proteins alter the filament structure and kinetics over different length scales. The study suggests that modulation of filament kinetics through structural changes is a general regulatory mechanism of actin dynamics, which may play a more active role in cellular processes.
The paper describes a method called fastFISH that enables real-time detection of nascent RNA transcripts at the single-molecule level. The method uses fast, intrinsically unstructured 19-mer probes that are designed to hybridize with randomly selected 3-base RNA targets. Self-quenching of the probes reduces background fluorescence from free probe molecules, allowing the use of higher concentrations for real-time imaging. The authors show that by using this method they can detect transcription cycles of the bacteriophage T7 RNAP at the sub-second level. The fastFISH probes are able to detect RNA production within 1 second of its formation, and the timing of RNA detection correlates with the known transcription kinetics of T7RNAP. The method has the potential to detect endogenous RNAs in situ and in vivo, silence gene expression, and build novel nucleic acid nanostructures.
This paper presents a study on the mechanism by which histone H3K9M mutations, which are associated with cancer, inhibit histone H3 lysine methylation. The authors used fission yeast as a model system to investigate the mechanism by which these mutations block histone methylation. They found that histone H3K9M inhibits histone methyltransferase Clr4 by trapping it at heterochromatin nucleation centers. The interaction between H3K9M and Clr4 is mediated by the SET domain of Clr4. The methionine side chain of H3K9M occupies the same binding pocket as the dimethylated lysine residue in Clr4. The presence of SAM does not directly contribute to the interaction between H3K9M and Clr4, but instead stabilizes the structure of the protein. They determined a crystal structure of the G9a histone methyltransferase in complex with an H3K9M peptide, which showed that the methionine side chain adopts a similar orientation to the dimethylated lysine side chain. They also identified ways to alleviate the trapping of Clr4 by H3K9M, such as by increasing the enzymatic activity of Clr4 or reducing its dosage. These results provide insights into the mechanism by which histone K-to-M mutations function as dominant negative regulators of histone methylation and suggest approaches for detoxifying their effects.
This paper discusses the discovery of the enzymatic activity of JMJD6, a protein that cleaves a protein called MePCE within the 7SK snRNP complex. JMJD6 was previously thought to be a demethylase, but the authors found that it actually cleaves MePCE within the complex. They used various biochemical assays and structural modeling to determine that JMJD6 specifically binds to MePCE, and that the cleavage of MePCE releases the P-TEFb complex, which in turn phosphorylates Ser2-CTD of Pol II. This process is similar to how TAT protein is involved in transcriptional regulation of HIV. The authors propose a model where JMJD6 binds to newly transcribed RNAs, recruits P-TEFb through BRD4, and then cleaves MePCE to release the P-TEFb, allowing phosphorylation of Ser2-CTD of Pol II. The finding of JMJD6 as a protease of MePCE helps explain the growth defects in cells lacking JMJD6.
The paper describes a study on the function of the protein ZCWP1, which is co-evolves with the PRDM9 protein that is involved in meiotic recombination. ZCWP1 recognizes sites marked by PRDM9's dual histone modifications of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 and recruits PRDM9 to these sites. ZCWP1 is required for proper DSB repair and synapsis in mice, but does not position DSBs. The study finds that ZCWP1 is recruited by PRDM9 to PRDM9-bound sites, and this recruitment depends on PRDM9's ability to deposit the H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 marks. ZCWP1 is also required for proper DMC1 removal at hotspots bound by PRDM9. Loss of ZCWP1 leads to defects in DMC1 removal and synapsis, indicating that ZCWP1 plays a role in PRDM9's second function beyond positioning DSBs. The study shows that ZCWP1 is recruited to PRDM9-bound sites independently of whether PRDM9 positions DSBs. The results suggest that ZCWP1 functions by attaching to PRDM9-bound homologous chromosomes and marking possible repair locations for DSB sites to help pair homologous chromosomes during synapsis.
This paper investigates how the non-coding RNA protein Xist evolved to recruit the protein Spen to silence transposon-derived elements in cis. Xist is derived from a retroviral insertion and is rich in transposable elements. Spen binds to these elements through its RNA-binding domains, which recognize a structural feature in the RNA. The authors find that Spen binds ERVK-derived RNA in the nucleus in a similar manner as it binds the A-repeat of Xist, with similar affinity and specificity. They show that the A-repeat is derived from a retroviral insertion and that inserting ERV elements into Xist led to the functionalization of Xist. This suggests that Xist evolved to recruit Spen via the insertion of ERV elements. They demonstrate that Spen can directly bind ERVK-derived RNA and recruit chromatin silencing complexes to silence these elements in cis, and that Xist silencing of the X chromosome is restricted to the Xist locus. Their results provide evidence that lncRNAs can evolve to form protein-binding domains through interactions with proteins, and that the invasion of an ERV-like sequence into Xist led to the functionalization of Xist. The study highlights the evolutionary origin of cis-restriction of Xist and the role of Spen in Xist-mediated gene silencing.
This paper investigates the role of kines-4 KIF21B in regulating microtubule organization and dynamics during T cell polarization. KIF21B is found to act as a factor that inhibits microtubule growth and induces pausing and catastrophes. KIF21B depletion leads to excessive microtubule elongation, which inhibits efficient centrosome translocation to the immunological synapse. The study shows that KIF21B acts as a fast and processive kinesin in T cells, walking along microtubules and inducing pauses at the plus ends. KIF21B-GFP expression in KIF21B-knockout cells partially rescues their defects in centrosome polarization, indicating that KIF21B's activity at the plus ends limits growth by inducing microtube pausing and catastrophes. The authors simulate the role of KIF21B in regulating microtubule dynamics using a computational model, showing that a small number of KIF21B molecules can significantly restrict microtube length and inhibit centrosome polarization. These results support the idea that KIF21B acts as a factor that restricts microtube elongation, which inhibits centrosome translocation and polarization.
The paper investigates how sexual interactions between males and hermaphrodites in the nematode species Caenorhabditis elegans affect the lifespan of these organisms. Previous studies have shown that long-term interactions between young hermaphrodites and males shorten their lifespan, but brief interactions do not. This study shows that brief sexual encounters with young males actually protect young hermaphrodites from premature death, even when self-sperm is present. The mechanism involves a sensing pathway between the somatic gonad and germline that is mediated by the protein CEH-18 and the Ephrin receptor VAB-1. Self-sperm, but not self-fertilization, is sufficient to protect hermaphrodites from the negative impact of mating. This pathway involves repressing the expression of genes that regulate the germline in the somatic gonad. The authors identify genes that are differentially expressed between young hermaphrodites and feminized individuals and contain a CEH-18 binding site and show that these genes are enriched for longevity-related GO terms. They propose that the ability of self-sperm to protect hermaphrodites may have evolved independently in multiple nematode species as a strategy to maximize reproductive success.
This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of nitrogen metabolism in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a major cause of tuberculosis. The authors found that Mycobacterium tuberculosis can utilize all 20 proteinogenic amino acids as nitrogen sources, but prefers glutamate, glutamate, aspartate, and asparagine as the most efficient nitrogen sources. The bacterium can take up and metabolize these amino acids, leading to a significant increase in intracellular pool size. However, most of the other amino acids are not homeostatically controlled and can only be utilized to a lesser extent. The authors also found that nitrogen atoms from glutamate and aspartate are utilized in a preferential manner, while amino acids containing two nitrogen atoms like aspartate and alanine are not easily utilized. The study shows that Mycobacterium tuberculosis can take up and metabolize multiple nitrogen sources simultaneously, including amino acids, but co-metabolism does not provide a growth advantage. The results suggest that Mycobacterium tuberculosis has evolved to utilize a number of nitrogen sources, which is likely important for its ability to persist in the human host. The findings reveal new details about Mycobacterium tuberculosis' nitrogen metabolism and may inform drug discovery efforts to target nitrogen uptake.
The paper describes the discovery of a novel oxygen-independent HIF-3α isoform, Hif-3α2, which lacks the N-terminal region and contains only the N-terminal AD and LZIP domains. Hif-3α2 is expressed in all embryonic stages and adult tissues but has weaker transcriptional activity compared to full-length Hif-3α1. Hif-3α2 regulates gene expression in an HRE-dependent manner and has a weaker effect on target gene expression compared to Hif-3α1. Hif-3α2 overexpression causes global growth retardation and developmental delay, as well as defective lateral symmetry, which suggests it acts at the Kupffer's vesicle development stage. The authors propose that Hif-3α2 inhibits the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by directly binding to β-catenin and promoting its degradation, which is distinct from the mechanisms reported for HIF-1α and -2α. This mechanism is specific to Hif-3α2 and not related to GSK3β/β-TrCP-mediated degradation.
The paper reports a new discovery about how stem cells in the C. elegans gonadia exit their niche. The niche consists of the distal tip of the gonad (DTC), the Sh1 cell, and the germ cells. The researchers found that some germ cells at the DTC-Sh1 interface divide asymmetrically, with one daughter staying associated with the DTC and the other becoming enwrapped by the Sh1 cell. This division is thought to be the primary mechanism of stem cell niche exit. The Sh1 cells extend distally into the progenitor zone and grow over the dividing daughter cell, allowing the germ cells to differentiate. This study shows that the Sh1 cells play an important but overlooked role in regulating the balance between stem cell renewal and differentiation. The results have implications for understanding how stem cells exit their niche and how the progenitor zone is organized.
The paper presents a comprehensive cytoplasmic model of Mycoplasma genitalium based on homology modeling and complexes. The model includes proteins, nucleic acids, metabolites, ions, and water, and is meant to capture the full cytoplasmic environment. The authors performed all-atomistic molecular dynamics simulations in MGm1, MGm2, and MGh to study the behavior of biomolecules in the cytoplasm. They found that the diffusion of biomolecules is significantly affected by the local crowding environment. Translational diffusion coefficients decrease as a function of the square of the Stokes radius, as expected, but metabolites have much slower diffusion due to interactions with macromolecules. Metabolites interact extensively with macromolecules and bind at different sites, which affects their binding kinetics. The model suggests that the inclusion of the full cytoplasmic environment and cellular components leads to more complex behavior than just volume exclusion. Weak protein-protein interactions consistent with recent NMR studies destabilize native states. The results indicate that biological systems may have evolved to exhibit these characteristics. The simulations revealed electrostatic effects play an important role in altering the interactions between proteins and metabolites. The study highlights the significance of cellular environments for understanding biological systems and motivates the development of whole-cell models that can capture the full physical details of the cytoplasm.
The paper discusses how the influenza virus hemagglutininin (HA) protein facilitates fusion between the virus and target cell membrane. The authors propose a model where HA trimers independently undergo conformational changes under low pH conditions, with each trimer inserting its fusion peptide into the target membrane. The fusion peptide release from its pre-fusion pocket is rate-limiting for virion arrest, and hemifusion. The authors show that the number of participating HA trimers, N, determines the rate of arrest and hemifusion. They experimentally validate this model by comparing the lag times between virion arrest and hemifusion for HA mutants that affect the HA-H2 interface. The model predicts that the rate of arrest is related to the number of HA trimers participating in the hemifusion reaction, and the rate of hemifusion is related to the number of HA trimers exposed to the target membrane. The simulations agree well with the experimental data and suggest that the number of participating HA trimers, N, is between 3-4. The results provide evidence for a long-lived extended HA intermediate that is rate-limiting for arrest and hemifusion, and could be a target for entry inhibitors. The paper suggests that the HIV fusion protein may also require recruitment of additional envelope trimers beyond the first one to mediate fusion.
The paper describes a systematic approach to characterize the functional connectivity and short-term dynamics of recurrent excitatory synapses in the adult mouse and human visual cortex. The authors used two-photon optogenetics to probe excitatory neurons and measured synaptic connections across different layers and cell types. They found that recurrent connections were sparse but not absent in both mouse and human cortex, with different connection rates between cell types. In the mouse, most excitatory connections depressed after 8 action potentials, while in the human, excitatory connections showed higher recurrent connectivity rates. They used a model to capture short-term dynamics and estimated release probability and recovery kinetics. The results suggest that recurrent connectivity may be a general property of excitatory neurons that is regulated by target region, but the observed differences between mouse and human connectivity may be related to differences in age. The authors propose that future work combining their results with other methods could generate a comprehensive description of the cortical circuit.
The paper describes a screen to identify neurons that promote aggression in Drosophila. They found that activation of a subset of P1 neurons in the medial hypothalamus, which were previously identified as promoting courtship behavior, can also induce aggression. They showed that activation of these P1 neurons resulted in a sustained increase in aggression without a concomitant increase in wing extension, indicating that the aggression phenotype reflects a fly-intrinsic influence. They also found that the aggression phenotype could be uncoupled from wing extension by activating a small subset of FruM+ P1 neurons. The experiments revealed that the threshold for optogenetic enhancement of aggression is lower than that required for wing extension. The paper suggests that P1 neurons may promote a persistent internal state that facilitates future social behavior, which can endure without any increase in locomotor activity. The authors propose that P1 neurons may play a direct or indirect role in regulating aggression, with the possibility of a direct model where P1 neurons directly activate or prime persistent aggression-promoting circuitry, and an indirect model where P1 neurons trigger a persistent internal state that is neutral with respect to aggression or courtship. The discovery of a small cluster of neurons that control both fighting and mating behavior in Drosophila and mice suggests that there may be an evolutionarily conserved circuit motif for the organization and control of innate social behaviors.
This paper investigates recombination in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, specifically meiotic recombination during meiosis. The authors generated 131 recombination events through crossing tetrads of a quartet background and single pollen tetrads. They identified 10 putative gene conversion events (NCO-GCs) and 60 crossover events (COs) through genotyping and sequencing of tetrad offspring. They found that NCO-GCs are significantly longer than COs, with an average length of around 30-40 bp. They also found that NCO-GCs are associated with open chromatin regions and poly-A motifs, which are known to be inaccessible to nucleosomes. The authors conclude that meiotic recombination in A. thaliana targets open chromatin and is negatively correlated with nucleosome occupancy. They also found that NCO-GCs generate new allelic variants of genes, but COs introduce copy number variations that can lead to gene conversions. Overall, the paper suggests that meiotic recombination is an important mechanism for generating new alleles in A. thaliana, but at a relatively low rate compared to other organisms.
This paper investigates the effect of muscle fatigue on motor skill learning. The authors found that even when participants were only fatigued on the first day of training, their learning rate was significantly lower on both days, indicating that fatigue had a long-lasting negative effect on motor skill acquisition. However, a subgroup of fatigued participants who continued training for an additional two days caught up to the level of the non-fatigued group on the second day. They also found that fatigue impaired learning in the untrained hand, suggesting that fatigue affects central motor-skill learning mechanisms beyond any potential effect within the fatigued muscles. To determine if the effect of fatigue was centrally mediated, they disrupted primary motor cortex function with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) after training on the first day. This diminished the detrimental effect of fatigue on learning, indicating that the effect is at least partly centrally mediated. The detrimental effects of fatigue were found to be specific to tasks that require fine force control, but not cognitive demanding tasks. These findings have implications for designing training protocols that take fatigue into account, particularly in sports and rehabilitation programs for patients with neurological conditions.
This paper presents a new microscopy-based assay to quantitatively measure DNA double-strand break (DSB) resection in living cells, specifically the long-range phase of resection catalyzed by the RecQ helicase Rqh1/Dna2. The assay involves engineering a 10.3 kb LacO array at an endogenous gene and a nearby ApoI site to generate a site-specific DSB, and then tracking the appearance of Rad52 foci that form as the DSB is resected. The assay allows for the visualization of resection in individual cells, revealing the time course and variability of resection rates. The authors find that loss of the RecQ helicase inhibitors Crb2 and Rev7 leads to a shift in the resection pathway from the Exo1-dependent pathway to the Rqh1/Dna2 pathway, resulting in faster resection rates. This suggests that loss of these inhibitors allows BRCA1/p53-deficient cells to become resistant to PARP inhibitors by compensating for the increased DSB load through the Rqh1/Dna2 pathway. The results indicate that RecQ helicases, when paired with DNA2, can drive hyperresection when derepressed, and this could promote genome instability. The findings provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying DNA repair and may have implications for cancer treatment strategies.
The paper describes a systematic study to uncover genetic variation that affects the probability of a Caenorhabditis elegans embryo surviving a gene perturbation. The researchers targeted 29 maternally-expressed genes in 5 wild-type strains from around the world and measured embryonic lethality across multiple generations. They found extensive variation in embryonic lethality between strains, with some strains showing high and low lethality across all targeted genes, indicating gene-specific and informational modifier effects. They identified gene-specific modifiers that affect embryonic lethality, which they determined using a quantitative genetic approach that partitioned the variation into genetic and informational modifiers. The genetic modifiers were found to be pervasive in natural populations, and could act via multiple mechanisms, such as network bypasses or pleiotropy. The study identified cryptic genetic variation affecting embryonic lethality, which was found to be rare. The researchers also used genome-wide association mapping to identify genetic variants associated with the modifier effects. The study demonstrates that cryptic alleles are likely to be common in populations and may mediate expression of genetic diseases arising from loss-of-function mutations. The results have implications for understanding how complex traits evolve and genetic architecture.
The paper investigates the heterogeneity in gene expression among single bacterial cells and how this heterogeneity relates to the production of acetate and acetoin, two metabolites produced in response to high levels of glucose and malate. The authors constructed a library of strains expressing fluorescent protein reporters for genes involved in carbon metabolism and found that two genes, sucC and alsS, exhibited heterogeneous expression. The expression of sucC was associated with high acetate production, while expression of alsS was associated with acetoin production. The sucC expression was found to be controlled by the competence system, which is a noise-excitable gene circuit that stochastically induces differentiation in individual cells. The authors used microfluidic experiments to observe the dynamics of sucC and alsS expression over multiple generations and found that sucC+ cells exhibited slower growth and higher acetate production, while alsS+ cells had slower growth and acetoin production. The authors propose that the sucC+ cells may provide an advantage in producing acetate early in growth and then switch to the alsS+ state later when acetate accumulates, allowing for acetoin production to protect against the acidic environment. The findings suggest that single cell analysis can reveal metabolic heterogeneity and subpopulations of cells that are specialized for different metabolic pathways, which could provide a predictable benefit in dynamic environments.
The paper discusses the repair of replication forks that are blocked at a specific point called the replication fork barrier, known as the RTS1 site, which is located near the ade6 locus on chromosome 3 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The paper shows that when replication forks are blocked at RTS1, Rad52 proteins are recruited to the site and initiate recombination, leading to the formation of double-stranded DNA. The paper argues that this recombination is similar to the repair of DNA double-strand breaks induced by the homologous recombination (HR) repair pathway in S. The paper shows that most replication forks converge at RTS1 within 10-60 minutes of the blockage, which is sufficient time for Rad52 proteins to recruit. However, some replication forks may converge later, leading to further recombination. The paper finds that deleting the ori-1253 origin, which fires closest to RTS1, increases the frequency of recombination at RTS1, indicating that the blocked replication fork is sufficient to initiate recombination. The paper concludes that the rapid induction of recombination following replication fork collapse at RTS1 is not required for cell viability, as deleting ori-1253 does not affect cell growth or viability. The paper proposes that the high frequency of recombination downstream of RTS1 indicates that restarted forks remain prone to recombination over a distance, and that this may help resolve recombination problems that occur during convergence.
The paper describes the results of an analysis of non-crossover recombination (NCO) events in mammals using genotyping array data from 34 three-generation pedigrees of Mexican American individuals. The authors found that NCOs localize to the same hotspots as crossing over (CO) events, with a sex-averaged rate of 5.9 x 10-6 per meiosis. They identified 103 putative NCO events from 12 million informative sites, of which 76% were single NCO sites and 28% were from ambiguous sites. They observed strong transmission bias towards the GC allele at NCO sites, with no difference in GC-bias across different recombination rates. They found that NCO events are more common in females than males and tend to occur at telomeres. They also identified complex NCO resolutions involving multiple NCO sites within short intervals, and long continuous NCO tracts that span hundreds of base pairs. They estimated the strength of gene conversion (gBGC) in NCOs and found that it is high, consistent with previous studies. The results suggest that NCOs play a role in shaping haplotype variation and may be responsible for observed patterns of LD. The authors also identified several long-range NCO events that were not detected in previous studies of human sperm. The study demonstrates the utility of whole genome sequencing for analyzing de novo NCOs in mammals.
The paper discusses the role of the disordered C-terminal tails of the XRCC4 and XLF proteins in DNA end-joining. The authors find that simultaneously mutating the phosphorylation sites in the disordered tails of both XRCC4 and XLF, which normally promote DNA bridging, completely abrogates DNA tethering in vitro. This suggests that the tails function together and that phosphorylation of both is required to disrupt the XRCC4-XLF complexes bound to DNA. Phosphorylation of the tails, even when studied in combination, does not affect the ability of XLF to stimulate the LIG4/XRCC4 complex or the ability of XRCC4 to promote V(D)J recombination. The results suggest that DNA bridging by XRCC4-XF complexes is required for efficient repair of chromosomal DNA double-strand breaks, but not for repair of episomal DNA ends. The study shows that disruption of the XRCC4-XLF complexes after repair is a crucial step in non-homologous end joining, possibly by releasing the Ku ring.
The paper presents evidence that the protein p21, also known as p21Cip1 or p2Cip1Waf1, functions as a positive regulator of DNA replication during the S phase of the cell cycle, rather than its previously thought negative regulator role in CDK inhibition. The authors found that p21 levels are insufficient in cycling cells to in order to inhibit CDK activity. Instead, p21 localizes to replication forks and recruits alternative DNA polymerases, preventing the loading of Polκ to replication factories. When p21 is depleted, it promotes nascent DNA elongation, but also allows the misuse of Polκ, leading to DNA replication defects and genomic instability. p21's ability to interact with PCNA is required for this function. The paper shows that p21 depletion causes under-replicated/unresolved genomic regions to enter mitosis, transmitting DNA damage. The results indicate that p21 acts as a novel tumor suppressor by controlling DNA replication events at every S phase, relying on its ability to interact with PCNA. The paper suggests that p21's role in undamaged DNA replication is most likely related to controlling DNA synthesis events on undamaged templates, allowing the selection of the most adequate polymerase on the go.
The paper presents a structural and functional study of Tribolium castaneum kinase 1 (TcINK1), an ortholog of human parkin 1 (hPINK1), which is a key regulator of mitochondrial quality control and autophagy. The authors identify that the third insertion in the kinase domain of TcINK1, Ins3, contributes to formation of a binding site for ubiquitin that is critical for TcINK1-mediated ubiquitin and Parkin phosphorylation. They find that autophosphorylation of Ser205, in addition to Ins3, helps recognize substrates. The study shows that TcINK1 shares mechanisms for substrate recognition and kinase activity with hPINK1, providing insights into the molecular basis of hPINK1 mutations associated with familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease. The structure of TcINK1 defines functional roles for its unique loop insertions in ubiquitin substrate recognition and catalytic activity, which could aid drug discovery efforts. The study highlights the importance of the hydrophobic core in the C-terminal extension of TcINK1 and provides clarity on the impact of disease-associated mutations on hPINK1 structure and function.
The paper discusses the role of mast cells in dengue fever infection. The authors found that mast cells are activated during dengue infection and release vasoactive factors that promote vascular leakage. They showed in mouse models that mast cell activation is sufficient to induce vascular permeability, and that drugs targeting mast cells or their products can limit this leakage and vascular pathology. They also found that high levels of mast cell activation were associated with severe vascular complications in human patients, including dengue haemorrhagic fever. The authors suggest that mast cells may be a useful biomarker for predicting the severity of dengue disease, and that targeting mast cells could be a potential strategy to treat dengue-induced vascular pathology.
This paper discusses the results of an investigation into the role of phosphorylation of specific sites on the glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) in the development of Alexander disease, a rare and fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by missense mutations in the GAP gene. The study found that missense mutations affecting certain sites on GAP promote the accumulation of GAP within perinuclear aggregates and nuclear invaginations, which are characteristic of Alexander disease. The phosphorylation of a site on the head domain of GAP, serine 13, was found to promote the formation of perinuclear aggregates and was selectively elevated in brain tissue from patients who died very young. In vitro, phosphorylation of serine 13 on GAP inhibited the assembly of filaments and promoted the incorporation of GAP within perinuclear aggregates, similar to what was observed in Alexander disease astrocytes. The study also found that increased expression of caspase-6, a protease involved in cleaving GAP, was associated with the most severe form of Alexander disease. The results suggest that phosphorylation of GAP may contribute to the development of Alexander disease by promoting the accumulation of GAP within perinuclear aggregates, which may compromise the nuclear envelope. The study provides a new phosphorylation signature that could potentially be used for diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for Alexander disease.
The paper proposes using mobile phones as acoustic sensors to collect mosquito wingbeat frequencies for automated identification. They demonstrate that mobile phones with built-in microphones can record mosquito wingbeats with sufficient sensitivity to distinguish between different species, even at distances of up to 50mm. They compare the acoustic quality of different mobile phones and find that even a basic phone can collect high-quality data. They then develop a machine learning algorithm to classify mosquito species based on their wingbeat frequency distributions, showing that their method can correctly identify species with overlapping frequency distributions. They test their approach in the field, collecting acoustic data from mosquitoes in various environments and locations, and show that pooling mobile phone recordings from multiple volunteers can produce spatiotemporal maps of mosquito distributions that are more detailed and localized than traditional trapping methods. They propose a citizen science approach to mosquito surveillance using this technique, where volunteers can quickly collect data using their mobile phones, providing a scalable and low-cost means of sampling mosquito populations in resource-constrained areas. The approach has the potential to screen for exotic or invasive species, map fluctuations in mosquito populations over time, and inform mosquito control strategies tailored to a given location.
The paper discusses how positively selecting self-peptides can shape the post-selection CD4+ T cell repertoire by enhancing the selection of good responders. The authors used the cytochrome c model system to investigate the relationship between positively selecting self-peptides and post-selection CD4+ T cell repertoire. They found that a single positively selecting self-peptide, gp250, could select a large number of CD4+ T cells and positively selected a full TCR Vβ repertoire, including Vα1+Vβ3+ TCRs, which were the dominant responders to the antigen. The gp250-selected Vα1+Vβ3+ TCRs exhibited conserved CDR3 features, including serine at CDR3α9, which hydrogen bonds with the MCC peptide tyrosine residue at P328. The results suggest that positively selecting self-peptides may favor the selection of TCRs and CDR3 features that are specific for a specific antigen, shaping the post-selection CD4+ T cell repertoire. The study provides evidence that a positively selecting self-peptide can optimize the immune response to a specific antigen by enhancing the positive selection of good responders, and that a single positively selecting self-peptide can select many CDR3s with conserved features for specific antigen recognition. The findings offer new insights into how to generate a post-selection CD4+ T cell repertoire with desired antigen specificities through engineering the positively selecting self-peptide.
This paper investigates the topography of the missing hand in individuals who have suffered upper limb amputation. The authors used ultra high-field functional MRI to study the digit maps of the primary somatosensory cortex in 2 amputees and 13 controls. They found that the digit maps of the missing hand showed characteristics of digit selectivity and inter-digit overlap, consistent with the two main principles of digit topography described in the literature. However, the maps were weaker and noisier compared to the controls. Despite the lack of peripheral inputs from the injured nerve, the digit maps in the missing hand persisted, suggesting that the missing hand topography is driven by central nervous system processing rather than peripheral inputs. This finding provides evidence that the original function of the cortical territory can be preserved even after sensory input is lost. The authors suggest that the preserved digit maps may be maintained by motor signals from the motor system. The results have implications for the development of intuitive neuroprosthetics that require representation of individual digits in disabled populations.
The paper describes the results of knockout mice of the epithelial splicing factors Esrps 1 and 2 in order to study the role of epithelial-specific splicing in development and organogenesis. The authors found that Esrps 1 and 2 are required for development of the epithelial layer of the skin, with loss of Esrps resulting in defects in cleft lip and palate, facial morphology, and skin, lung and salivary gland development. The degree of splicing defects varied between mice with loss of Esrps alone or in combination, with the most severe defects seen in mice with combined loss of both. The authors conclude that the Esrps play an essential role in epithelial cell development and regulation of epithelial-specific splicing events, providing insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying cell type-specific splicing factors and their role in organogenesis.
The paper presents evidence that the satiety hormone Leptin-Chromorphin 2 (LCN2) crosses the blood-brain barrier in non-human primates and binds to the melanocortin 4 receptor in the hypothalamus, leading to appetite suppression. In humans, postprandial LCN2 levels increase after meals and correlate with a decrease in hunger sensation. However, the postprandial response is blunted in obese individuals, suggesting that this mechanism may contribute to the development of obesity. The paper finds that LCN2 can be administered to monkeys to increase appetite suppression, with a 17-fold increase in circulating levels and a 28% reduction in food intake compared to baseline. While the effects were not statistically significant due to the small sample size, the results suggest that LCN2 has potential as a treatment for obesity. The paper concludes that the postprandial regulation of LCN2 is conserved across species, but its response is blunted in individuals with obesity.
This paper investigates how the barrel cortex encodes wall position and motion during whisker-guided locomotion. The authors used tactile virtual reality and optogenetic experiments to test whether neural activity in the barrel cortex is necessary for guiding whisker-based locomotion. They found that mice use neural activity in the barrel cortex to guide locomotion along a wall. They showed that neural activity in the barrel cortex can drive a behavior resembling wall tracking, with neural activity in layer 4 sufficient to guide locomotion in an illusory corridor. They also found that barrel cortex neurons have a rich representation of wall distance, with some neurons showing non-monotonic tuning curves. The authors propose that complex tuning curves in barrel cortex neurons are generated through cross-columnar inhibition and short-term synaptic plasticity, and that mice adjust their whisker movements in subtle ways with wall distance to change the strength of the interactions. This allows the barrel cortex to represent wall distance in a population of tuned neurons, which is robust to metabolic costs. The findings suggest that the barrel cortex encodes wall distance through a simple code of excitation and inhibition, and that wall-tracking behavior likely involves a combination of neural activity in the barrel cortex and downstream brain areas.
The paper investigates the mechanisms by which peptide immunotherapy (PIT) induces tolerance in CD4+ T cells. The authors find that PIT drives the expression of the immune checkpoint protein PD-1 on CD4+ T cells, which is required for tolerance. PD-1 expression is associated with demethylation of the Pd1 gene promoter and the loss of 5-hydroxymethylation of the Pd1 promoter. The authors propose that PD-1 expression is a key component of PIT-induced tolerance, which is distinct from the mechanisms of PD-1 expression in exhausted CD8+ T cells. PIT-treated CD4+ T cells had reduced levels of the repressive histone mark H3K27me3 at the Pd1 promoter, indicating that demethylation occurred. They also found that T cells exposed to PIT had reduced expression of CD25 and IL-2, which was not evident in PD-1+ T cells. The results suggest that PIT-induced PD-1 expression is required for PIT-driven tolerance in CD4+ T cells, which is distinct from the mechanisms of PD-1 expression in exhausted CD8+ T cells.
The paper examines dental calculus and ground stone tools from Mesolithic and Neolithic sites in the Danube Gorges area of the north-central Balkans to investigate the use of wild grasses and other plant species by foragers. The study analyzes hundreds of starch granules and phytoliths from 50 individuals to determine which plant species were consumed by Mesolithic and Neolithic foragers. The results show that Aegilops species, a wild grass of the genus Aegilops, were consumed by Mesolithic foragers as early as 950 BC and likely since the beginning of the Holocene. The presence of starch granules still lodged in dental calculus and on GSTs from Mesolithic individuals suggests that Mesolithic foragers had a familiarity with domesticated cereals, which were not introduced in the Danube Gorges area until the mid-7th millennium BC. The study also finds that wild grasses, oats, legumes, millets, acorns, and cornelian cherries were consumed by Mesolithic foragers, and some species of the Poaceae family, including Avene and Fabaceae, were identified on GSTs. The evidence from dental calculus and GSTs suggests that Mesolithic foragers had a long-term familiarity with wild plant species, which likely allowed them to adopt domesticated cereals when Neolithic groups arrived. The results provide new insights into how Mesolithic foragers managed wild plant resources and contributed to the development of agriculture.
The paper describes a strategy to identify novel driver mutations in cancer genes that are not commonly detected by current genomic sequencing approaches. The authors focused on genes that had previously been identified as cancer drivers in mouse models but had not been frequently altered in human cancer. They found that one such gene, MAGI3, was frequently truncated by premature cleavage and polyadenylation of its intron 10, leading to the production of a truncated protein that inhibited YAP activity and promoted anchorage-independent growth. The truncated protein was found to physically interact with full-length MAGI3, interfering with its interaction with YAP. The authors propose that these truncated MAGI3 proteins may act as dominant-negative mutations that contribute to cancer development by disrupting the inhibitory interaction between full-length MAGI3 and YAP. Their findings suggest that premature cleavage and polyadenylation of genes can generate truncated proteins that have functional consequences even when expressed at lower levels than the full-length isoform, providing a new mechanism for driver mutations in cancer.
The paper describes a study on how zebra fish larvae detect and pursue small moving prey. The authors identified a subset of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) that are selectively activated by small moving objects, called af7-projecting RGCs, which are tuned to specific sizes and speeds of prey stimuli. They found that these RGCs project to the anterior visual field and the superficial layers of the optic tectum, which are involved in prey capture behavior. They showed that ablating af7-projecting RGCs significantly reduces prey capture behavior, suggesting that these cells are required for this behavior. They identified two types of neurons that project to the af7 neuropil, one that projects to the rostral tectum and one that projects to the nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus, which could modulate or gate tectal output. They propose a model where af7 neurons provide excitatory input to tectum neurons, which then trigger prey capture swims based on visual information and behavioral state. The results suggest that parallel and interconnected pathways between the retina and midbrain areas are involved in prey detection and capture.
This paper investigates the composition of trophallactic fluid in the carpenter ant Camponotus floridanus. Trophallactic fluid is a social fluid transmitted between individuals in social insect colonies that contains nutrients and molecules that help coordinate social behavior. The authors analyzed trophallactic fluid from young and mature colonies, as well as individual workers and queens. They found that trophallactic fluid contains many enzymes involved in metabolism and protein products of metabolism, which may be important for consolidating resources and determining caste roles. They identified 519 proteins in the trophallactic fluid and found that proteins abundant in mature colonies were more likely to be involved in metabolism and oxidative stress, while proteins abundant in young colonies were more involved in carbohydrate metabolism. The authors suggest that this difference in trophallactic fluid composition may help explain why social insects are able to subvert the tradeoff between reproductive fitness and lifespan. The study demonstrates that trophallactic fluid transmits molecules related to metabolism, stress response, and social behavior, and may play a role in controlling the social life cycle of colonies.
The paper describes a new method called ensemble refinement that uses X-ray diffraction data to model protein dynamics. The method restricts the number of structures in the ensemble refined from the diffraction data, which reduces the risk of overfitting. This allows for more detailed analysis of the dynamics of the protein structures. The authors applied the method to 20 protein datasets from the PDB and found that the resulting ensembles provided insights into the molten cores of some proteins, which may indicate intermediates or support dynamic fluctuations that are important for function. They also found that the ensembles revealed details of order-disorder transitions between active site and core residues, suggesting a mechanism of entropy compensation to support enzymatic activity. The difference in dynamics between cryo and ambient temperatures showed that crystal annealing removes crystallographic conformational fluctuations that are functionally relevant. In summary, the method provides a new way to model protein dynamics that complements existing high-resolution structural information from crystallography, and could enhance our understanding of molecular mechanisms.
The paper discusses how a mutation in the CDON gene, which codes for a component of the Sonic Hedgehog pathway, when combined with fetal alcohol exposure during embryonic development, leads to a spectrum of holoprosencephaly and craniofacial defects. The study shows that CDON functions early in development, likely regulating Nodal signaling, and that CDON mutations synergize with fetal alcohol exposure to produce the defects. The authors find that CDON mutations reduce expression of genes involved in Nodal signaling, including Lefty1 and Lefty2, and that CDON and LRP2 both bind to TDGF1, a component of the Nodal receptor. The study proposes a model where CDON and LRP2 function together to regulate Nodal signaling during the formation of the primitive streak, and that a combination of CDON and fetal alcohol exposure during a narrow window of sensitivity results in defects in the rostroventral midline. The exact mechanism by which CDON interacts with Nodal signaling is not yet clear, but the study suggests that CDON regulates Nodal signaling in addition to its known function as a co-receptor for Hedgehog. The findings provide insight into how environmental factors interact with genetic mutations to cause birth defects and the role of Nodal signaling in developmental patterning.
The paper describes a study on the neural circuits that mediate presystemic regulation of antidiuretic hormone (AVP) release in response to water and food intake. The authors found that water-related presystemic signals are relayed to AVP neurons through the lateral hypothal nucleus (LH) and the medial preoptic nucleus (MPO), specifically through magnocellular and paraventricular AVP neurons. Excitatory and inhibitory inputs from the LT are required for water-related presystemic regulation of AVP neurons. The MnPO/OVglut2 neurons are the main entry point for water-related presystemic information. However, MnPO/OVglut2 neurons play no role in mediating food-related presystemic signals, indicating that food-related presystemic regulation involves a distinct neural pathway. The authors identified three groups of LT neurons that provide direct input to AVP neurons: SFOVglut2, MnPO/OVglut2, and MnPO/OVglut2 neurons. Silencing of MnPO/OVglut2 and MnPO/OVglut2 neurons showed that both excitatory and inhibitory inputs from these neurons are necessary for water-related presystemic regulation of AVP neurons. They found that the MnPO/OVglut2 neurons are responsible for pre-estive suppression and the MnPO/OVglut2 neurons for post-estive suppression. The study suggests that the MnPO is the main entry point for water-related presystemic information and that the ARC and PNZ may also play roles in mediating food-related presystemic regulation.
The paper presents a study of human footprints found in the Grotta della Bàsura cave in Italy dating back to the Upper Paleolithic period around 14,000 years ago. The researchers analyzed 107 human footprints, digit and handprints found on the cave floor and walls, as well as traces of bear and other animals, to reconstruct the activities of a small heterogeneous group of people who explored the cave. They identified five main footprint morphotypes indicating a minimum of five individuals, and estimated the stature and gender of the producers based on footprint measurements. They found that the humans were likely a small group of children, adolescents, sub-adults and adults, with a male as the probable trackmaker of the largest footprint group, based on digitigrade and semi-plantigrade footprints. The knee and patella impressions also provided information on the body structure of the trackmakers. The findings support the idea that Upper Paleolithic people were not only driven by subsistence needs, but also engaged in social and symbolic activities, as evidenced by the presence of child and adolescent footprints in the cave. The study highlights the importance of considering age and gender in analyzing ancient human remains, as the footprint morphology and measurements suggest a mixed gender composition of the group.
The paper presents a new assay to measure the olfactory preferences of individual Drosophila larvae using a Y-maze assay. They show that larvae can learn to associate odor with reward neuron activation and form a discrete and quantized memory that persists overnight. The training protocol involves presenting larvae with CO2 and air in a maze, and rewarding them with activation of the DAN-i1 neuron. The authors find that the larvae either form a preference for or avoidance of CO2 based on the timing of the reward, and that repeated presentation of CO2 without reward can erase the memory. They demonstrate that they can form stable protein-synthesis dependent long-term memories that persist overnight by training the larvae with spaced rather than massed training. The results suggest that larvae form a discrete switch from innate avoidance to learned indifference, and that the training protocol determines whether this switch is all-or-none or graded. The experiments demonstrate a new apparatus capable of measuring olfactory learning in situ.
The paper proposes a new hypothesis to explain how bats navigate using echolocation. According to the hypothesis, bats do not reconstruct a 3D layout of the environment from their echoes, but instead recognize places by remembering their echo signature - their echo signature or template. This template-based approach is analogous to view-based place recognition in insects. The paper tests the viability of this hypothesis by analyzing the templates derived from ensonification data collected at different sites with varying levels of clutter. The results show that templates from more cluttered environments have larger linear catchment distances and higher probability of correct classification, indicating that bats navigate by maintaining a distance from reflectors that balances the opposing effects of motion parallax on template linear catchment distance and probability of correct classification. This suggests that bats use a preferred distance to reflectors to facilitate navigation. The paper argues that bats likely use a cognitive map, but there is currently little evidence to support this. The proposed template-based place recognition mechanism is an alternative to the 3D modeling approach that has been proposed. Future experiments could test the prediction that bats cannot distinguish between complex scenes if their 3D layout is similar, but their templates are different.
The paper proposes a Brownian ratchet mechanism for protein translocation, where the ATPase activity of SecA regulates the opening and closing of the SecY channel, allowing only narrow regions of substrate to pass through the channel while larger substrates are blocked. The SecY channel is mostly open when ATP-bound to SecA and mostly closed when ADP-bound. The closed channel selectively blocks larger substrates, while the open channel allows narrow regions of substrate to pass through. This mechanism requires only an open SecY state to function. The model accounts for many observed properties of SecYEG-SecA complexes, such as the ATP-bound and ADP-bound states, the narrow width of the SecY channel, and the dependence of translocation rate on substrate length. The mechanism represents a breakthrough in understanding SecY-mediated protein export and may be a common mechanism for other transport systems.
The paper discusses how the nervous system of the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans controls the acquisition of male-specific features during the transition from larva to adult. The authors identify a regulatory pathway composed of genes that control the timing of sexual maturation in the nervous system. This pathway includes the genes lin-28, lin-4, and lin-1, which are expressed in a temporally controlled manner and regulate the expression of other genes involved in neuronal differentiation. The lin-29 gene is specifically expressed in male neurons and is required for the acquisition of male-specific neuronal and behavioral features. The lin-29 gene is expressed in a sexually dimorphic manner and its expression is controlled by a complex regulatory mechanism involving the heterochronic gene regulatory pathway, the sex determination pathway, and terminal selector genes. The lin-29 gene is required for the acquisition of male-specific postural and locomotor behaviors, such as the ability to locate a vulva and mate. The authors identify two targets of the lin-29 gene, the mab-3 and dmd-3 transcription factors, which are expressed in neurons in a sexually dimorphic manner and control the timing of neuronal differentiation. The results suggest that the nervous system of C. elegans has a modular organization with distinct regulatory pathways controlling different aspects of sexual maturation.
The paper identifies a protein antigen that is expressed in cells carrying a heritable genome, specifically germ cells, and is conserved across many eukaryotic species. The antigen, called Gcna, has a disordered protein structure that has evolved over billions of years. The Gcna protein is found to be essential for male fertility in mice, as mice lacking the gene exhibit sterility. The Gcna protein is also expressed in stem cells and cells derived from germ cells, indicating it is involved in cells that carry the genome that will be passed to the next generation. The Gcna protein is a member of a small family of proteins with similar disordered regions and motifs, suggesting it functions in molecular recognition and DNA binding. The authors propose that Gcna may help cells maintain the integrity and stability of heritable genomes across generations.
The paper discusses how the female reproductive tract epithelial cell ERα regulates fertilization and embryo development in the ovary. The authors found that mice lacking ERα in the ovary epithelial cells have reduced fertilization and embryo development. They propose that this is due to the fact that the absence of ERα leads to an increase in protease activity in the ovary lumen, which disrupts the zona pellucida and plasma membrane, allowing antimicrobial peptides to access and cause protease-mediated embryo lysis. The results suggest that elevated estrogen levels in the preovulatory period via epithelial ERα act to suppress protease-mediated innate immunity in the ovary to allow fertilization and embryo development. Disruption of estrogen signaling, such as from endocrine disruptors or post-coital contraceptives, could potentially prevent pregnancy by interfering with this mucosal immune response. The paper also suggests that embryotoxic effects of abnormally elevated innate immune mediators in the fallopian tubes may contribute to infertility in women with hydrosalpinges, endometriosis, or unexplained infertility.
The paper discusses the role of FOXL2 in regulating estrogen signaling in granulosa cells. FOXL2 is found to be required for the expression of the estrogen receptor ESR2, which is the main effector of estrogen signaling in granulosa cells. FOXL2 regulates ESR2 expression by cooperating with Activin/SMAD3. FOXL2 also activates the expression of Cyp19a1, the rate-limiting enzyme in estrogen production. FOXL2 is shown to be required for the production and receptivity of estrogen signaling, establishing a coherent loop that maintains granulosa cell identity. The authors use chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) to identify FOXL2 binding sites in granulosa cells and find that FOXL2 binds intronic regulatory elements. They show that FOXL2 is required for the upregulation of ESR2 expression and that ESR2 is the main effector of estrogen signaling in granulosa cells. The results provide evidence for a coherent feed-forward loop in which FOXL2 stimulates both estrogen production and receptivity to maintain granulosa cell identity. The findings complement a previous model in which FOXL2 and ESR1 cooperate to repress Sox9 expression. The study provides insights into the mechanisms by which FOXL2 regulates granulosa cell differentiation and highlights the importance of FOXL2 in estrogen signaling.
This paper describes a study on how the vomeronasal organ detects pheromones from mice to trigger mating behaviors. The vomeronasal organ expresses more than 30 vomeronasal receptors (VRs), but most have not been identified. To identify VRs that receive specific pheromone signals, the authors used a technique that profiles individual vomeronasal neurons' responses to urine samples from different sexes and reproductive statuses. They identified two VRs, V1rj2 and V1rj3, that respond specifically to sulfated estrogens. These receptors were then cloned and expressed in vomeronasal neurons to purify their ligands. The authors found that both V1rj2 and V1rj3 were activated by sulfated estrogens, but only V1rj3 was activated by the female-specific gender cue. The V1rj2 receptors were found on chromosome 7 while V1rj3 were on chromosome 17, indicating that the receptors are likely homologous. The authors propose that redundant receptor expression may have evolved to detect the female gender cues. The study suggests that the vomeronasal system has two logical mechanisms to process pheromone signals: one that requires both estrus and gender cues to trigger mating behavior, and another that requires only gender cues. The authors propose that the redundant expression of gender receptors may improve detection of important signals and provide better quantitative information of pheromone ligands. The study highlights the importance of identifying receptors and their ligands to understand pheromone communication.
The paper describes how two transcription factors, HOXB13 and CDX2, can bind to two distinct DNA sequences with similar affinities. The authors crystallized the DNA-binding domains of these proteins bound to their optimal and alternative DNA sequences and determined their structures using X-ray crystallography. They found that while the overall conformations of the proteins and DNA were similar, the residues involved in the protein-DNA interface were different. The thermodynamic properties of the two DNA sequences were found to be different, with one sequence, TCG, having a higher enthalpy and lower entropy, while the other, CAA, had a lower enthalpy and higher entropy. The authors propose that the ability of some transcription factors to bind to two distinct DNA sequences with similar affinity is due to the presence of both an enthalpy and entropy optima. They suggest that the enthalpy and entropy optima are due to the stability of the water network at the protein-DNA interface, and that the two optima are located at different positions in sequence space. They argue that the observed phenomenon is likely to be widespread and that models for transcription factor binding should be adjusted to include features that allow two or more optima. The findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanism behind genetic epistasis, where a single mutation can affect multiple binding sites.
The paper describes the first crystal structure of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa flagellum protein FliD at 2.2 Å resolution. The structure reveals that FliD consists of two flexible regions outside of the head domains that are necessary for oligomerization, which are not conserved across bacteria. The crystal structure shows that FliD oligomers into hexamers in solution and in the crystal, and that the head regions are stabilized by intermolecular interactions. The paper also shows that the flexibility of the flexible regions outside of the head domains is necessary for FliD oligerization, and that FliD can be constrained to its hexameric state by inter-subunit disulfide bonds, which makes it functional in vivo. The results provide insights into the oligomeric states of FliD in different bacteria and the structural determinants of its function as a capping protein for flagella. The study highlights the dependence of FliD oligomerization on its flexible regions, which enhances the prospects of developing small molecule inhibitors of FliD oligomerization and flagellum function as a novel antibiotic agent.
The paper discusses a new mechanism of vancomycin resistance in Escherichia coli. The authors find that a mutation in the waaL gene, which encodes an O-antigen ligase, produces a novel form of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that is directly responsible for vancomin resistance. The mutation, waaL15, allows the LPS molecules to be modified with lipid II, a scarce lipid that is used to synthesize peptidoglycan, creating additional glycoforms. These LPS glycoforms are able to bind vancomin, which is then sequestered outside of the cell, preventing it from reaching its target inside the cell wall. This mechanism of vancomin resistance is different from previously described resistance mechanisms in Gram-positive bacteria, where vancomycin binds to existing peptidoglycan. The ability of LPS* to bind vancomin is demonstrated through live cell microscopy and in vitro binding assays. The authors suggest that the waaL15 mutation confers resistance by acting as a molecular decoy for vancomin, titrating it away from the true target inside the cell. Overall, the ability of LPS* to modify lipid II and confer resistance is remarkable, and demonstrates the tremendous adaptability of bacteria under antibiotic stress.
The paper discusses the regulation of TRPM3 channels by G protein coupled receptors. The authors found that activation of μ opioid, GABA, and NPY receptors inhibits TRPM3 channels in DRG neurons. The inhibition was mediated by Gβ subunits rather than Gα subunits. The effect was observed in both intracellular and whole-cell patch recordings. The authors also showed that constitutive activity of μ opioid and NPY receptors inhibits TRPM3. In vivo, agonists that activate these receptors inhibited nociceptive behaviors. The results suggest that TRPM3 in sensory neurons is subject to Gi/o GPCR regulation via a Gβ subunit action. Activation of μ opioid and GAB receptors are important analgesic mechanisms that operate both peripherally and centrally, including actions on the central terminals of sensory nerves in the spinal dorsal horn.
The paper used high-throughput sequencing to study the memory CD4 T cell repertoire of healthy adults before and after administration of an HB vaccine to investigate the influence of preexisting memory T cells on vaccine-induced immunity. They found that preexisting memory CD4 T cells specific to the antigenic component of the vaccine, HBsAg, could predict which individuals would mount an early and more vigorous immune response to the vaccine, as evidenced by a higher fold change in anti-HBs antibody titer and more significant induction of antigen-specific CD4 T cells. This was observed in early-converters, but not in late-converters or non-converters. An expanded subset of 4-1BB+ CD45RA- TREG cells was found in late-converters, which may explain the delayed immune response. The authors suggest that preexisting memory CD4 T cells likely result from the complex interplay between cellular immunity and the human microbiome and that the microbiota may play a role in modulating immunity to viral infection. The study highlights the potential of using the memory CD4 TCRβ repertoire to predict vaccine-induced immunity and identifies an expanded subset of 4-1BB+ CD45RA- TREG cells as a possible mechanism for vaccine-induced immunosuppression.
The paper discusses how changes in the conformational cycle of tubulin, the protein that makes up microtubules, can affect microtubule dynamics. The authors found that a specific mutation in tubulin, T238A, that makes microtubules more stable by straightening the conformation, reduces the frequency of catastrophe and shrinking of microtubules. They conclude that the conformational cycle of tubulin in the microtubule lattice determines the dynamic properties of microtubules and makes them more amenable to regulation. The mutation affects the allosteric response to GDP in the lattice, which in turn affects the rate of shrinking and frequency of catastrophe. The authors propose that cooperative conformational linkage in the lattice amplifies the individual response to nucleotides and allows microtubules to be regulated by cellular factors that enhance elongation, trigger catastrophe, and promote nucleation.
This paper describes a technique called Poly-Ribo-Seq that improves upon ribosome profiling to study the translation of small open reading frames (smORFs) in Drosophila cells. The authors developed Poly-Ribo-Seq to specifically target the actively translated smORFs, which are difficult to detect using traditional ribosome profiling methods. Poly-Ribo-Seq purifies mRNA based on ribosome binding, and then performs ribosome profiling on the purified mRNA. This approach detects many more smORFs translated in Drosophila cells compared to traditional ribosome profiling, which detects all mRNA bound by ribosomes. The authors show that the translated smORFs have similar translation efficiencies, amino acid compositions and bioinformatic characteristics to canonical coding proteins, indicating they are functional. They also detect smORFs translated from non-coding RNAs and 5' UTRs, although these are less efficiently translated. The results indicate that thousands of smORFs may be translated in metazoan genomes, with two types of translated smORFs: longer ones producing peptides similar to canonical proteins, and shorter ones lacking peptide markers. The longer smORFs may be membrane associated.
The paper discusses how different sensory channels integrate their information to drive responses in the primary somatosensory cortex. The authors find that different sensory afferents, such as rapidly adapting and pacinian afferents, integrate their signals differently in the somatosensory cortex. While rapidly adapting afferents increase their firing rate with stimulus amplitude, pacinian afferents saturate at low stimulus amplitudes and are highly frequency-dependent, the pacinian afferents exhibit more precise spiking patterns. As a result, the pacinian afferents primarily determine the timing of cortical responses. The authors simulate the responses of different afferent classes and find that the optimal filters for encoding natural textures are excitatory, narrower, and have balanced excitation and suppression indices, matching the observed filters derived from cortical neurons. They conclude that the integration of different sensory channels reflects their response properties and the statistics of the stimuli encountered during everyday interactions with objects, and that the process of integration allows the cortex to efficiently encode information from disparate sensory channels.
This paper investigates the mechanisms by which neuronal activity regulates blood flow in the brain using optogenetics. The authors use a mouse line that expresses a light-sensitive protein called ChR2 in a subset of GABAergic neurons in the cortex, called INs. They show that selective stimulation of these INs with light pulses of light can induce a biphasic change in arterial diameter consisting of dilation followed by constriction, consistent with previous studies. However, the constriction phase is specific to activation of INs and not excitatory neurons. The authors identify the vasoactive molecule as NPY acting on Y1 receptors, which are expressed in INs. The study demonstrates that the initial dilation occurs in deeper layers and the constriction in superficial layers, consistent with the idea that vasoactive messengers are released from deep neurons rather than axons. The results suggest that neuronal activity directly regulates blood flow through release of vasoactive messengers, rather than through changes in energy metabolism. The findings provide evidence that direct activation of specific neuron populations can drive vasoactive effects.
The paper describes a structural and biochemical study of the FGFR2 kinase, which is a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays important roles in development, tissue homeostasis, and metabolism. The authors used X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy to investigate the conformational changes of the kinase domain when the A-loop tyrosine is phosphorylated, and how this affects the molecular brake, DF latch, and αC tether. They found that the A-loop tyrosine phosphorylation causes conformational changes that disengage the molecular brake and activate the kinase. The molecular brake is held in place by hydrogen bonds between the molecular brake residues and the catalytic loop, and the DFG latch. The αC tether also plays a role in transmitting the conformational changes between the molecular brake and the active site. The authors identified a four-site allosteric mechanism that couples the molecular brake, DF latch, and αC tether to the active site through the A-loop tyrosine phosphorylation. They showed that weakening the DF latch and αC tether through mutations leads to increased kinase activity. They also used NMR to validate their model and found that mutations that target the molecular brake and αC tether have the expected effects on kinase activity. They also found that ATP binding does not directly induce the conformational switch from the inhibited to active conformation, suggesting that mutations that target the molecular brake and DF latch are the main effectors of allosteric switching.
The paper presents a method called SynEM that aims to automatically detect synapses in large-scale electron microscopy images of the mammalian cerebral cortex. The method first uses volume segmentation to extract interfaces between neurite segments and then classifies these interfaces into synaptic or non-synaptic based on texture and shape features. The classifier outputs a score that determines whether an interface is synaptic or not. The method achieves high precision and recall for detecting synapses, allowing it to directly provide the location, size and synaptic partners of synapses without requiring human annotation. The method is able to detect synapses in high-resolution EM images, and the authors show that it can also be applied to lower-resolution images with higher efficiency, making it scalable to large volumes. The method outperforms existing synapse detection methods, and the authors demonstrate its effectiveness by applying it to a sparse local cortical connectome. The authors discuss the advantages of their approach and how it can be extended to other types of EM data.
This paper investigates how the balance between sleep and sexual drive determines whether a male fruit fly sleeps or engages in courtship. The authors find that male flies suppress their sleep in the presence of a female fly, and that this is mediated by a subset of octopaminergic neurons in the subesophageal ganglion called MS1 neurons. Activating these neurons leads to a reduction in sleep in male flies, while inhibiting them leads to increased sleep loss. They also identify a subset of FRU neurons that receive input from MS1 neurons and mediate the courtship behavior of male flies. The authors propose that MS1 neurons act upstream of FRU neurons to promote wakefulness, and that excitatory input from MS1 neurons to multiple FRU clusters mediates the balance between sleep and courtship. The findings provide insight into how motivational factors like sex drive are integrated into neural circuits to control the choice between competing behaviors like sleep and courtship.
The paper investigates the differences in function between the Delta-like ligands DLL1 and DLL4, which are expressed redundantly during embryonic development. Previous work showed that DLL4 is more potent than DLL1 in activating Notch receptors in cell culture, but DLL1 is needed for proper somite patterning. The authors generated mice expressing chimeric ligands containing the extracellular domain of one ligand and the intracellular domain of the other to test whether the extracellular or intracellular domain determines the differences in function. They found that the extracellular domain of DLL1 determines its function during somite patterning, while the intracellular domain of DLL1 is not sufficient for this function. They also found that residues outside of the binding interface, such as EGF repeats 1-3, contribute to the differences in function between DLL1 and DLL4. Domain swaps showed that the MNNL-EGF3 region of DLL4 is responsible for the discriminatory potential between the two ligands. These results suggest that interactions between the N-terminal EGF repeats of DLL1 and EGF repeats 8-10 of Notch receptors, as well as interactions outside the known binding interface, contribute to the differences in function between DLL1 and DLL4. The authors conclude that the contact aminoacs in the MNNL and DSL domains do not determine the functional divergence between DLL1 and DLL4 in vivo, but residues in the domain cores and outside the known interface are the main factors.
The paper discusses how capillary endothelial cells in the brain regulate blood flow in response to neuronal activity. The authors found that capillary endothelial cells express TRPV4 channels, which are tonically suppressed by basal levels of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PIP2). When GqPCR agonists activate PIP2 hydrolysis, they reduce PIP2 levels, which in turn enhances TRPV4 channel activity and inhibits the hyperpolarizing signaling mediated by Kir2.1 channels. This indicates that a single GqPCR signaling cascade can tune the balance between TRPV4 and Kir2.1 signaling in capillaries. The low level of TRPV4 activity aligns with the functional role of capillaries, and activation of capillary GqPCRs should trigger Ca2+ signals in cECs, leading to membrane hyperpolarization and subsequent vasodilation. The authors propose that capillary Ca2+ signals may serve as "stop signs" or "speed bumps" that redirect hyperpolarizing signals away from certain brain areas. The study suggests that PIP2 levels in brain capillaries are sufficient to saturate Kir2 channels and tune TRPV4 channel activity, and that differences in PIP2 levels between capillaries and peripheral ECs may explain the higher NVC activity in the brain.
The paper argues that handshaking may serve as a subliminal mechanism for humans to sample social chemosignals. The authors found that humans often bring their hands to their noses and sniff after handshaking with someone, and that handshaking significantly increases the exploration of the hand that shook. This behavior is selectively increased following handshakes within the same gender, while exploration of the non-shaking hand decreases after handshakes across gender. The authors propose that handshaking may subserve social chemosignaling, where humans are actively searching for chemical cues from conspecifics without awarenes. They propose that the behavior is influenced by context, and may shift across settings. While the results suggest that humans are actively searching for chemosignals, they acknowledge that the specific details of the results may be context-dependent. The study highlights the potential role of social chemosignaling in human behavior beyond the well-known examples of menstrual synchrony and mate selection.
This paper presents Spot-On, an open-source software package that corrects biases in single-molecule tracking (SMT) data to accurately estimate protein dynamics and subpopulations. SMT is becoming increasingly popular for analyzing protein dynamics, but existing methods are limited by biases in the data. Spot-On corrects for four main biases: defocalization, localization errors, high particle densities, frame rate errors, and model limitations. It uses a kinetic modeling framework to infer diffusion constants and subpopulation sizes from the histogram of displacements. It also accounts for defocalization bias by modeling the fraction of molecules that move out of the axial detection range over time. The authors validate Spot-On on simulated SMT data and then apply it to real SMT data from live cells using stroboscopic photoactivation SMT. They show that Spot-On accurately estimates diffusion constants and subpopulations across a wide range of frame rates and can handle anomalous diffusion. Spot-On is robust and can be extended to other diffusion regimes and models. The authors hope that Spot-On will help make SMT more accessible to the community and contribute to standardized acquisition and analysis procedures.
This paper describes a method for identifying regulators of the plant circadian clock using dominant negative E3 ubiquitin ligases. The authors generated a library of transgenic plants expressing decoy E3 ligases that lack the ability to interact with the E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme but retain the ability to bind to the substrate. They transformed the decoy constructs into Arabidopsis plants and monitored the clock function using a luciferase reporter. They found that many of the decoy plants have effects on the clock period and phase, but the single mutants do not. They identified two U-box genes, MAC3A and MAC3B, as regulators of the circadian clock, which were not identified by traditional genetic screens. MAC3A and MAC3B interact with components of the NTC complex, which plays a role in splicing. The decoy technique is a powerful tool for identifying regulators of the circadian clock, as it can overcome genetic redundancy. The authors propose that the MAC3A and MAC3B genes are redundant and their functions may be distinct. The decoy technique is broadly applicable to other areas of plant biology and the generated molecular and genetic reagents are available to the scientific community.
This paper describes a new technique called imaging mass cytometry (IMC) that can simultaneously analyze multiple immune cell types and functional markers in postmortem brain tissue from a patient with multiple sclerosis. The technique uses lanthanide metal-conjugated antibodies to simultaneously image thousands of markers on a single tissue section, enabling the analysis of single-cell phenotypes and functional states in relation to demyelination and inflammation in brain lesions. The authors applied IMC to brain tissue from a patient with severe rebound MS activity after natalizumab withdrawal, analyzing immune cells in lesions and normal-appearing white matter. They found that IMC reproduced known immunohistological patterns of microglia and lymphocyte activation, identified cell types and functional states that were not detectable with standard IF/IHC, and provided better resolution and quantitative data. The technique enabled the analysis of cell-cell interactions in relation to lesion morphometry and demyelinating activity, and had the potential to profoundly impact our knowledge of the inflammatory response and tissue injury in the MS brain. However, the study had some limitations due to the analysis of immune cells in a single case and the lack of information on cell populations in other brain regions. The technique was able to identify cell types in the lesions that were not detected by standard IF/IHC, and may be useful for understanding the role of B cells in MS lesions.
This paper investigates the potential of targeting the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases to resolve chronic neutrophilic inflammation in chronic inflammatory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The authors identify inhibitors of the ErbB family, which accelerate neutrophil apoptosis in vitro and vivo, reducing inflammation in zebrafish and mouse models of inflammation. They show that ErbB inhibitors can accelerate neutrophil apoptosis even in the presence of inflammatory stimuli, suggesting that ErbB activity may be required for constitutive neutrophil survival. Inhibition of ErbBs in human neutrophils from patients with COPD results in increased apoptosis and reduced inflammation. The authors conclude that targeting ErbBs may be a novel therapeutic strategy for chronic neutrophil inflammation and that existing Erb inhibitors in clinical use could be repurposed for this indication.
The paper discusses the use of cryo-electron microscopy to study the process of sporulation in Bacillus subtilis. Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) has been instrumental in revealing details of cellular architecture at the nanoscale that cannot be achieved with traditional optical microscopy. The authors used cryo-ET to study the developmental process of sporulation in B. subtilis, obtaining high-resolution images of cells during different stages of sporulation. They found that the septal peptidoglycan is not completely degraded at the onset of engulfment, but instead gets thinner as the spore grows towards the mother cell. They propose that the septal peptidoglycan is stretched by increased turgor pressure caused by chromosome translocation, leading to the thinning. DMP complexes are required to maintain a flexible septum, preventing the mother cell membrane from moving around the spore. The authors also found that new peptidoglycan is synthesized at the leading edge of the engulfing membrane, which is degraded by DMP complexes to make room for membrane migration. This allows the engulfing membrane to advance. The DMP complexes also form finger-like projections at the leading edge of the engulfing membrane, which help the membrane to move around the spore. The authors propose that engulfment evolved by developing mechanisms to spatially and temporally regulate the conserved proteins that synthesize and degrade peptidoglycan. The study provides mechanistic insights into the process of engulfment, while revealing novel architectural details about sporulation.
The paper investigates the challenges and opportunities in using the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database for pharmacovigilance. The FAERS database contains over 8 million reports of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and is growing. The authors map drugs to their active ingredients and chemical structures to compare ADRs across drugs with similar chemical structures. They find that reporting biases and inconsistencies in FAERS can mislead pharmacovigance analyses. They identify drug-ADR associations that are missing in the data, for example, that rosiglitazone has a high incidence of cardiac problems while pioglitazone does not. They demonstrate how analyzing the pharmacokinetics of drugs can help identify which drugs are likely to cause a particular ADR. They also show how mapping drugs to their active ingredients can help identify associations that would otherwise be missed. The paper highlights the importance of controlling for biases and inconsistencies in FAERS data to enable systematic and comprehensive analyses of the large volume of data. The authors make tools available to help other investigators use FAERS to improve drug safety and health outcomes.
This paper describes a comprehensive analysis of gene expression changes in response to different schedules of cocaine exposure in the brain, focusing on the striatum and ventrolateral striatum. The authors found that the ventrolateral striatum (VLS) is a major hub of cocaine-induced plasticity, with differential expression of immediate early gene expression (IEGs) between the two striatal subdomains. The VLS shows a unique pattern of IEG induction, with dampening of IEG expression following repeated cocaine exposure, while the medial striatum (MS) shows a more moderate dampening. The VLS IEG expression is mainly composed of dopamine receptor D1-expressing neurons, which are involved in action selection and behavioral inhibition. The authors showed that selective inhibition of VLS Egr2-expressing neurons using a Cre-dependent inhibitor reduced cocaine-induced place preference, suggesting that VLS Egr2 expression is required for cocaine seeking behavior. The study also found that VLS Egr2 expression is downregulated following dominant-negative Egr2 expression in the VLS, indicating a functional role for Egr2 in cocaine-induced plasticity. The results suggest that the VLS Egr2 expression is specifically involved in the development of cocaine seeking behavior. Overall, the study provides a comprehensive view of the transcriptional dynamics and spatial dynamics of cocaine-induced plasticity in the brain, highlighting the VLS as a key region for cocaine-induced plasticity.
This paper examines how the distribution of ion channels in cell bodies of O-LM cells may contribute to their spiking properties in vivo. The authors build multi-compartment models of O-LM cells with somatic and somatodendritic ion channels and examine how different ion channel distributions affect which frequencies O-LM cells are recruited to in response to inhibitory inputs. They find that somatodendritic cells with higher conductance ion channels are able to be recruited at higher theta frequencies, while somatic cells are recruited at lower theta frequencies. They simulate cAMP modulation of ion channels to enhance theta spiking and find that this shifts the spiking resonance peak to higher theta frequencies, consistent with experimental findings. This suggests that dendritic ion channels may be important for determining theta spiking preferences of O-LM cells. The authors predict that dendritic expression of ion channels on O-LM cells could shed light on functional properties of O-LM cells and their role in different theta rhythms.
The paper investigates the potential effects of the bacteriophage T7 protein Ocr on the host transcriptional machinery. The authors find that Ocr can directly bind to E. coli RNA polymerase and inhibit both σ70 and σ54 dependent transcription. They use structural biology to show that Ocr binds at the RNA polymerase cleft, competing with sigma factors for recruitment and transcription initiation. They observe two distinct binding modes of Ocr to RNA polymerase, where either the proximal or distal monomer interacts with the positively charged β' clamp. The rigidity of the Ocr dimer imposes constraints on the binding sites, which are optimized for inhibiting restriction enzymes but can still be accommodated by the flexible RNA polymerase channel. The authors propose that Ocr could be modified to fine-tune its DNA mimicry for binding to specific DNA processing proteins, and potentially target antibiotic targets. They also demonstrate that Ocr can inhibit transcription under stress conditions when transcriptional activity is reduced, suggesting it could be used to diminish bacterial survival during stationary phases or persistence. Their results reveal a new bifunctional activity for Ocr beyond its established role inhibiting type I restriction/modification systems.
The paper describes a new method to study sleep in Drosophila larvae, which exhibit periods of quiescence characterized by a change in posture and increased arousal threshold. The authors show that these quiescence bouts meet behavioral criteria for sleep shared across different species and demonstrate that sleep in larvae is a reversible behavior that is required for normal proliferation of neural stem cells. They find that short-sleeping mutants in adult flies exhibit no sleep phenotype in larvae and that direct activation of dopamine neurons in larvae fails to promote wakefulness, suggesting genetic and neural sleep regulatory mechanisms may be distinct at different developmental time points. They find that sleep loss in larvae is associated with a reduction in neural stem cell proliferation, but not the rate of cell division. The authors propose that this may be because sleep regulatory mechanisms in early life are coupled to the most relevant environmental cues for drives that change throughout maturation, such as feeding demands. The results suggest that larval sleep may play an important role in initiating the wave of neurogenesis but not be essential to sustain it, and that impaired neurogenesis following sleep loss could have broader implications for brain development. The tractable larval system provides a new opportunity to investigate how sleep and neurogenesis are mechanistically coupled.
The paper describes how the bacterial metabolite lactic acid can induce the yeast prion [GAR+], which allows yeast to overcome glucose repression and become metabolic generalists. The authors show that lactic acid can induce [GAR+] in both S. cerevisiae and the evolutionarily distant species D. bruxellensis, indicating that this mechanism has been conserved across a vast evolutionary distance. The ability of lactic acid to induce [GAR+] is found to depend on the transcription factor SOK2 in S. cerevisiae and may involve other molecules beyond lactic acid. The discovery of a simple molecule like lactic acid that can induce a heritable epigenetic transformation in neighboring organisms highlights the potential of cross-kingdom communication as a mechanism for rapid and effective signaling between species. The findings demonstrate that cross-kingdom interactions may be more common than previously appreciated and could provide new insights into biological processes.
This paper investigates how overlapping transcription of genes into the same strand can regulate gene expression by mediating transcriptional interference. The authors find that overlapping transcription of genes in the same strand can repress the expression of genes in the opposite strand. They use the HMS2:BAT2 locus as an example, where the HMS2 gene is transcribed in the sense strand and the BAT2 gene is transcribed in the antisense strand. They show that the HMS2 antisense transcript represses the BAT2 transcript, and that the antisense transcript is reciprocally expressed with the HMS2 transcript. The authors propose a two-state model where the HMS2 transcript exists in one state and the BAT2 transcript exists in the other, and that transcription factors at the HMS2 promoter control the switch between these states. They also find that the antisense transcript insulates BAT2 from interference by HMS2 transcription. The study suggests that the distance between genes and the strength of their promoters determine whether they can form a transcription unit, and that overlapping transcription can act as a regulatory mechanism to couple different transcription units. The findings suggest that overlapping transcription of genes in the same strand is a common feature of the yeast genome and could be relevant to chronobiology and other biological processes.
This paper investigates how locomotion modulates the activity of neurons in the primary visual cortex V1. The authors used two-photon calcium imaging to monitor the activity of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in V1 during darkness and during visual stimulation with drifting gratings. They found that most excitatory neurons showed increased activity during locomotion, while most inhibitory neurons showed context-dependent responses. However, most inhibitory neurons, especially somatostatin (SST) neurons, showed context-dependent responses to locomotion. This challenges the previous model that VIP neurons disinhibit excitatory neurons during locomotion, as most VIP neurons were context-independent. The authors suggest an alternative neuromodulatory hypothesis where locomotion inputs directly activate excitatory and inhibitory neurons. They propose that subcortical nuclei may also convey the increased gain of visual responses during locomotion. The results indicate that the functional properties of inhibitory neurons vary depending on the behavioral context and that there may be functional subtypes within each population.
The paper investigates how the human tactile system processes edge orientation information during object manipulation tasks that require fine dexterity. The authors used a novel experimental paradigm to establish the tactile system's ability to process edge orientation information during object manipulation. Participants used their fingertip to contact a dial with an edge of varying length and orientation and then rotate the dial to point the pointer towards a target position. They found that participants could orient the pointer accurately, with average alignment error around 1-3° for edges that spanned the entire fingertip, which was significantly better than previously reported tactile orientation acuity. Participants gathered and processed the relevant tactile information quickly, initiating appropriate dial rotation within 200ms of initially touching the edge. The authors propose that this ability may reflect a previously overlooked feature of the peripheral tactile apparatus, where first-order tactile neurons branch in the fingertip and innervate many spatially segregated mechanoreceptive transduction sites. This arrangement enables the tactile system to resolve edge orientation through a coincidence coding scheme where an edge contacting the skin at a certain location and orientation excites a subset of neurons while a different subset of neurons is activated for a slightly different edge orientation. This coincidence code is attractive because it could enable the requisite edge orientation acuity and operate at a speed suitable for the control of manipulation. The authors modeled this using a virtual patch of skin with known biological constraints and found that the presence of heterogeneous receptive fields with many subfields in first-order tactile neurons was particularly beneficial for demanding tasks that utilize tactile information approaching the limits of the system's spatial resolution. The results suggest that the tactile system can extract and use edge orientation information at speeds comparable to those of visual information during tool use tasks, which is consistent with the automaticity of tactile signals during unfolding manipulation.
The paper discusses the results of NMR experiments on apo-SOD12SH, a protein that is associated with ALS disease. The experiments show that apo-SOD2SH transiently forms native-like dimers, non-native dimers, and helices, indicating a rugged free energy landscape. Structural models were generated for the non-native oligomers. The authors conclude that the metal-binding loops of apo-SOD2SH are flexible and the dimer interface is the primary factor driving self-association. The formation of non-native dimers and helices is independent of metal binding, suggesting that these conformations are generated through conformational fluctuations. The findings provide insight into the early stages of SOD1 aggregation and may guide the design of therapeutic agents to prevent the formation of cytotoxic species.
The paper presents a cryo-electron microscopy structure of the human ATP-dependent potassium channel KATP, composed of SUR1 and Kir6.2 subunits. The structure shows the channel as a tetramer of SUR1 subunits, with the ABC transporter module in the center and the inward-rectifier K+ channel in the form of a quatrefoil or propeller. The SUR1 subunits are found to be sensitive to ATP and ADP, while the Kir6.2 subunits are sensitive to ATP but insensitive to ADP. The SUR1 transporter module is found to be in a quatrefoil form, which is different from the propeller form of the published structure of the hamster-rat KATP hybrid. The SUR1 transporter module is found to be in contact with the Kir6.2 channel in the quatrefoil form, and this interaction may allow ATP binding to influence the channel's activity. The authors use a focused classification and refinement strategy to improve the reconstruction of the KATP structure, achieving resolutions of 3.9 Å for the quatrefoil form and 5.6 Å for the propeller form. The structures provide clues on how the SUR1 subunit regulates the KATP channel through ATP binding and ADP binding. The study highlights the importance of ATP binding sites on the Kir6.2 subunits and the lasso extension in regulating channel activity. The findings suggest that SUR1 is an ATP sensor that can sense changes in ATP levels even at physiological concentrations.
This paper compares the biology of the apicomplexan parasite species Toxoplasma gondii and Hammia hammidium, which are closely related but have distinct life cycles. The authors find that T. gondii has a flexible tachyzoite-bradyzoite life cycle that allows it to infect both the intermediate and definitive hosts, while H. hammid has a rigid tissue cyst stage that is infective only to felids. T. gondii has spontaneous cyst formation and rapid replication, while H. hammid has a much slower replication rate and is resistant to alkaline pH-induced cyst formation. The authors identify genes that are uniquely expressed in T. gondii and show that H. hammid has a distinct transcriptional profile, including genes that are expressed in response to alkaline pH. They also develop a stable transgenic H. hammid line that allows for further study of the parasite's developmental biology. They find that H. hammid's reduced replication rate and inability to form cysts in vitro and in vivo likely contribute to its reduced virulence. The study highlights the different developmental strategies of these two species and how T. gondii's ability to dynamically alter its life cycle may underlie its greater virulence.
The paper describes the identification of a new histone modification called histone H3K23me3, which is found specifically in germline heterochromatin during meiosis in the ciliated protozoan Tetrahymena. H3K23me3 is found on the H3F isoform of histone H3, which is produced by proteolysis. The loss of H3K23me3 during meiosis leads to increased DNA double-strand breaks at pericentric heterochromatin, which is associated with misregulation of the DNA repair pathways and reduced progeny viability. The authors propose a model in which H3K23me3 helps organize a higher-ordered heterochromatin structure that protects pericentric regions from DNA double-strand breaks during meiosis. The authors show that H3K23me3 is conserved in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, where it is also found in meiotic germline chromatin, and upregulated during meiosis. The loss of H3K23me3 in mutants leads to increased meiotic double-strand breaks at non-coding regions, suggesting a role for H3K23me3 in protecting repetitive genetic sequences from DNA repair. The study highlights the importance of studying the link between histone modifications and their biological context to understand the epigenetic code.
The paper discusses how adding aquatic animals like carp, crabs, and turtles to rice fields can increase rice yields and reduce fertilizer use. The authors conducted three field experiments over four years in China, comparing rice monoculture to rice-aquatic animal coculture. They found that adding aquatic animals increased rice yield and nutrient efficiency, reduced weed biomass, and had positive effects on soil nitrogen content. In mesocosm experiments, the authors showed that unconsumed feed from aquatic animals was used by rice plants. The authors suggest that this increased nutrient use efficiency could help increase yields and reduce fertilizer use in rice-aquatic animal coculture systems. They also note that farmers could potentially benefit financially from the increased income from selling aquatic animal products. However, the paper acknowledges potential negative effects of adding feed and increased decomposition rates. The authors suggest that more research is needed to fully understand the benefits and drawbacks of this practice and how to optimize the coculture system.
The paper discusses the role of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) in zebrafish embryogenesis and how it is regulated by sphingolipid metabolism. S1P is generated through phosphorylation of sphingosine by sphingosine kinases encoded by two genes, sphk1 and sphk2. Sphk1 and sphk2 are expressed in zebrafish embryos as maternal transcripts. Sphk2 is essential for early embryogenesis, but the loss of sphk2 leads to accumulation of sphingosine, which can be tolerated by embryos that upregulate ceramide synthesis through the salvage pathway involving the gene cers2b. The cers2b gene encodes an enzyme that can sense sphingolipid levels and convert them into ceramide. The study shows that zebrafish embryos lacking sphingolipase activity have increased levels of sphingosine and ceramide, but are relatively resistant to to sphingosine-induced toxicity. The cers2b gene is upregulated in sphk2 mutants, which suggests that it is a protective mechanism to prevent excessive sphingolipid accumulation. The study also shows that cers2b gene expression can be regulated by sphingolipid levels and not just the presence of the gene. The study reveals a novel mechanism by which the genome senses and regulates sphingolipid levels during embryogenesis through the cers2b gene, providing insights into the role of sphingolipids in zebrafish development.
The paper proposes two approaches to amortize the computational cost of large numbers of simulations required for ABC inference. One approach is to learn a function fΦ⁢ ( x , θ ) that maps θ to the likelihood function ℓ⁢ (θ|x) . The function fΦ⁢ (x , θ ) is learned using an MLP or CNN as a function approximator. The learned function ℓ⁢ (θ|x) can then be used as a plug-in to perform posterior inference. The MLP approach does not enforce the constraint that ℓ⁢ (θ|x) is a valid probability distribution, but the CNN approach exploits the constraint that ∫𝒳ℓ⁢ (θ|x)⁢𑝐�=1. The paper shows that both approaches can achieve good parameter recovery for models that have analytical likelihood functions. The CNN approach requires more resources and is more suitable for trial-by-trial inference. The paper discusses several limitations and directions for future work, including incorporating the methods into the HDDM toolbox, using adaptive sampling, and exploiting the differentiability of the networks. The main advantage of the proposed approaches is that they can perform posterior inference for a wide range of inference scenarios without requiring repeated training.
The paper describes an optogenetic approach to systematically investigate the individual contributions of components involved in pulling forces that generate the position of the spindle in the early C. elegans embryo. The authors used the TULIP system to control the localization of endogenous proteins in the embryo through light-induced heterodimerization. They found that membrane-attached Gα subunits, GPR-1/2 and LIN-5 are required for cortical pulling forces, while membrane-bound LIN-5 acts as an obligate adapter and activator of cytoplasmic dynein. The Gα protein serves as a membrane anchor, but Gα•GDP/GTP does not contribute directly to force generation. The coiled-coil protein RIC-8 is required for Gα subunit localization but does not directly contribute to pulling forces. The paper proposes that the trimeric Gα anchor evolved to augment context-specific regulation of spindle positioning. The results suggest that direct membrane recruitment of dynein through LIN-5NuMA is sufficient to generate cortical pulling forces, while the Gα protein may indirectly promote spindle positioning through cell signaling. The optogenetic approach expands the molecular biology toolbox for in vivo studies and could be applied to investigate how the spindle position determines cell cleavage and cell fate.
This paper presents evidence for homologous recombination between different mitochondrial genomes in Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila yakuba. The authors show that restriction enzyme cutting can induce homologous recombination between these genomes, even between genomes that differ by only a few SNPs. They used germline expression of restriction enzymes to induce DSBs in heteroplasmic flies, which led to the emergence of recombinant genomes that had a mix of sequences from the two parental genomes. They identified recombination events by sequencing the parental and recombinant genomes and found that the recombinants had long stretches of homology without gaps. They also showed that a single DSB was sufficient to promote homology-dependent repair and exchange of a continuous stretch of sequence, even up to 1 kb. This supports the idea that homologous recombination can occur in animals, which has implications for evolution and mitochondrial genome stability. The authors suggest that the ability to detect recombination events in heteroplasmic flies provides a means to characterize the process, and that even rare recombination could have a profound impact on the production of variants and mitochondrial disease mutations.
The paper describes a new class of chimeric antigen receptors called Chimeric Antigen Receptors for Phagocytosis (CAR-Ps) that can redirect phagocytosis towards specific antigens. The CAR-Ps consist of an extracellular antibody fragment recognizing the target antigen and an intracellular signaling domain from a T cell receptor or phagocytic receptor. The CAR-Ps were engineered to activate phagocytosis of cancer cells by recruiting phagocytic effector proteins and initiating phosphorylation of ITAMs. The authors tested the CAR-Ps in macrophages and found that they could efficiently internalize antibody-coated beads, and even engulf whole cancer cells, leading to significant reduction in cancer cell number. They identified a tandem CAR-P construct that was particularly efficient at whole cell ingestion, and found that combining the CAR-P with CD47 inhibition could increase phagocytosis. The CAR-P approach is transferable to different phagocytic cells and shows promise for targeting cancer cells for tumor killing.
The paper studies the transcriptional regulation of genes in response to Nodal/Activin signaling in embryonic development. It finds that Nodal/Activin signaling induces a dynamic transcriptional program that is remodeled over time, with different patterns of gene expression requiring different mechanisms. The study shows that Nodal/Activin signaling directly induces transcription by recruiting Pol II to chromatin, rather than by pause-release. It also finds that SMAD2, a key component of the Nodal/Activin signaling complex, binds to inactive chromatin and remodels it to recruit Pol II, leading to histone acetylation and nucleosome eviction. This leads to the induction of transcription. However, the SMAD2 binding does not directly correlate with gene expression, but rather the presence of SMAD2 at regulatory regions correlates with transcriptional kinetics. The study identifies that a subset of genes require protein synthesis for their induction and that the long term dynamic transcriptional profiles require a continuous Nodal/Activin signal. This suggests that SMAD2 complexes recruit secondary repressors to attenuate or return transcription, rather than simply losing their binding to enhancers. The study provides new insights into how transcriptional regulation is modulated over time by Nodal/Activin signaling.
The paper investigates the interaction between the telomerase enzyme telomerase and the protein TPP1. Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein complex that maintains the ends of chromosomes by adding telomere repeats. TPP1 is a protein that recruits telomerase to telomeres and stimulates its activity. The paper identifies a surface on the telomerase protein that interacts with the TPP1 protein, specifically the amino acid residues K78 and R132 in the TEN-domain. The authors test this hypothesis by generating mutants in the TEN-domain of telomerase that do not interact with TPP1 and examine their effects on telomere localization and activity. They find that mutations in the TEN-domain of telomerase that do not interact with TPP1 fail to localize to telomeres and have reduced activity, indicating that the surface interaction between telomerase and TPP1 is necessary for telomere localization. They also show that mutations in the TPP1 protein that compensate for the TEN-domain mutations in vivo can restore telomere localization and activity. This interaction between the TEN-domain of telomerase and the TEL-patch of TPP1 defines a direct protein-protein interface that could be targeted as a therapeutic strategy to inhibit telomerase activity in cancer cells.
The paper presents a whole genome sequencing study of Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission in a district in Malawi over 15 years. They used transmission networks constructed using whole genome sequencing data to investigate differences in transmission patterns between the seven lineages of the bacteria. They found that lineages 2 and 3 were more likely to transmit and cause new cases of tuberculosis, while lineage 1 was less likely to cause disease and transmit, even though it had lower virulence in animal models. The proportion of tuberculosis due to recent infection and transmission decreased over time, suggesting success of tuberculosis and HIV control programs. The findings suggest that social clustering of HIV-infected individuals may increase transmission opportunities to susceptible individuals who manifest disease, but the changes are not due to drug resistance or host subpopulations. The study provides strong evidence for differences in transmission patterns and virulence between lineages, unrelated to HIV infection or host subpopulations.
The paper presents a cryo-electron microscopy study of the ClpB protein, a disaggregase that helps to prevent protein misfolding and aggregation. The authors used a chimera protein, BAP-ClpP, that binds to the protein ClpP, to study the structure of the ClpB hexamer. They found that the ClpB hexamer has a globular shape, but the central channel is not as compact as in previous crystal structures. The authors were able to determine the structure of the central channel using a BAP-ClpP complex, and they found that the MD is not projecting outwards from the hexamer, but is instead lying on the surface of the hexameric ring with a variable degree of tilt. The MD orientation varies around the ring, with some MDs tilted and others horizontal. The authors propose a model where the MD acts as a molecular switch that can move between a repressed state where both motif 1 and 2 ends of the propeller are protected, to an active state where motif 2 is deprotected and available for binding to DnaK. The MD's tilt or orientation determines whether it can bind to DnaK. The study provides new insights into the mechanism of the ClpB disaggregase and how it regulates its activity through the movement of the MD.
The paper describes the biochemical characterization of the magnesium transport protein MgtA from Escherichia coli. MgtA was overexpressed and purified from E. coli and found to be activated by anionic phospholipids, specifically cardiolipin. MgtA was shown to be sensitive to magnesium levels in vitro, with a narrow activity range of 10-15 μM Mg2+free. This suggests that MgtA is able to transport magnesium into the cytoplasm. The localization of MgtA to cardiolipin-rich domains in the membrane was confirmed through confocal microscopy experiments. The paper proposes a model where MgtA acts as both a transporter and sensor for magnesium, sensing changes in cytoplasmic magnesium levels to regulate its activity. When cytoplasmic magnesium levels fall below a threshold, the riboswitch activates mgtA transcription. When cytoplasmic magnesium levels exceed the threshold, magnesium free inhibits MgtA activity at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. This model is consistent with the known regulation of mgtA expression by cytoplasmic magnesium levels. The study provides insight into the mechanisms of magnesium transport by MgtA and its role in regulating magnesium levels in E. coli cells.
The paper aims to define the areas suitable for zoonotic transmission of Ebola virus by using species distribution modelling techniques. They used boosted regression tree modelling to predict the geographical distribution of potential zoonotic transmission of Ebola virus in Africa based on outbreaks of the virus in humans and suspected reservoir species. The models predict that areas in West and Central Africa are most suitable for transmission. They found that 230 million people living in areas at risk of zoonotic transmission, mostly in rural areas, are at risk of being infected with the virus. The paper predicts that 15 countries outside of the current outbreak in Guinea have areas suitable for transmission, but have not reported index cases. They suggest that increasing connectivity and mobility have led to increased spread of the virus. The paper aims to improve understanding of the zoonotic transmission niche to inform public health efforts.
The paper presents evidence that the histone demethylase LSD1 plays a conserved role in maternal epigenetic reprogramming during mammalian embryogenesis. The authors deleted LSD1 from mouse oocytes using conditional Cre drivers and found that maternal LSD1 deletion leads to embryonic arrest at the 1-2 cell stage, failure to undergo the maternal-to-zygotic transition, perinatal lethality, and abnormal behavior in surviving offspring. They propose that LSD1's role in maternal epigenetic reprogramming, particularly in enabling the maternal-to-zygotic transition, results in long-range effects that manifest weeks later in the form of imprinting defects, developmental arrest, perinatal lethality, and behavioral abnormalities in offspring. The authors favor a model where LSD1's demethylation of H3K4 and H3K9 after fertilization leads to global disruption of epigenetic reprogramming, which in turn gives rise to the observed phenotypes. The results establish a novel mammalian paradigm where altered epigenetic reprogramming by a histone demethylase between generations can have long-range consequences in the early embryo that manifest weeks later.
This paper shows that the protein RBM15 is methylated by protein arginine methyltransferases PRMT1 , specifically at the arginine residue R57. This methylation triggers the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation of RBM15 by the E3 ligase CNOT4. RBM15 regulates alternative splicing of genes important for megakaryocyte differentiation by recruiting the splicing factor SF3B1. The methylation of RB15 by PRMT1 at R57 is required for this recruitment of SF3B1. The PRMT1-RB15 axis regulates the balance between proliferation and differentiation of megakaryocyte progenitors. The paper also shows that the PRMT1 V2 isoform, which contains additional amino acids on the N-terminus, is the main form that dimethylates RB15 in vivo. The PRMT1 V1 isoform has a different substrate specificity. The PRMT1-RB15 axis is also involved in chromosome translocation and methylation-demethylation crosstalk.
The paper presents an analysis of the HbP2 enhancer in Drosophila melanogaster which drives the expression of the hunchback gene in early embryonic development. The authors use a mathematical model grounded in molecular biophysics to explore how the nonlinear expression of HbP2 is generated. They find that pairwise cooperativity between Bcd binding sites is insufficient to explain the observed steepness and position of the HbP2 GRF. Instead, they propose that higher-order cooperativity through binding of multiple sites or through indirect mechanisms like chromatin remodeling and cofactors can achieve the observed sharp response. They test this by creating variants of HbP2 with different numbers of Bcd binding sites and measuring the resulting GRFs using quantitative imaging of reporter constructs. They find that the GRFs lie within a biophysically plausible range of position and steepness, indicating that higher-order cooperativity is required to match the experimental data. They propose that cofactors like Mediator, Creb binding protein, and other TFs may mediate higher-order cooperativity to generate the sharp expression. The results suggest that the molecular mechanisms underlying the HbP2 GRF involve both direct interactions between TFs and indirect effects through chromatin remodeling and cofactors, rather than just pairwise cooperativity between TFs. This study argues that cofactors play a more central role in shaping the quantitative features of gene regulatory functions than previously thought.
The paper discusses the role of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) in controlling viral infections. The authors found that pDCs are activated by contact with infected cells, leading to the production of interferon-induced genes (ISGs) and interferon-alpha (IFN-I). They show that this localized IFN-I response is sufficient to control viral infections, as opposed to the indirect pathogen-sensing mechanisms that require cell-free TLR9 stimulation. The early activation of pDCs leads to the rapid production of IFN-II, which in turn induces a localized ISG response. This localized response is sufficient to protect mice from viral infections, as shown by the ability of pDC-Irf7-restricted mice to survive DENV and CHIKV infections. The early ISG response in pDC:Irf7-mice is dependent on IFN-I signaling, as evidenced by the failure of IFN-I blockade to restore ISG expression. The IFN-II response is mainly mediated by NK cells in the spleen, which in turn accelerates the IFN-I response. The authors conclude that pDCs are a key cell type in the initiation of antiviral responses to RNA viruses, particularly through the localized production of IFN-I and IFNII.
This paper describes a new method for imaging calcium indicator GCaMP6f signals in macaque V1 over multiple months. The researchers used a genetically encoded calcium indicator in a viral vector to express GCaMP6f in macaque V1 over a period of months. They first tested different viral vectors and injection protocols to find the most stable expression. They found that the GCaMP6f signals were less sensitive to contrast and more selective for orientation and position than VSD signals. They then developed a simple computational model that simulated the GCaMP and VSD signals based on single neuron activity and tuning properties from the literature. The model's predictions matched the observed GCaMP and VSD tuning curves. The model suggests that the GCaMP signals reflect the summed spiking activity of local populations of neurons, while the VSD signals reflect the summed membrane potential. The higher amplitude and sensitivity of the GCaMP signals and its higher temporal resolution compared to VSD imaging make it a promising technique for studying neural population activity in behaving animals. The researchers conclude that combining widefield and two-photon GCaMP imaging in the same animal over extended periods of time will help resolve remaining questions regarding the relationship between the neural responses measured at different spatial scales.
The paper investigates the mechanisms by which mitochondria form cristae, the tubular and lamellar structures that make up their internal membranes. The authors propose that two distinct pathways exist for the formation of these structures. One pathway, called the fusion-dependent pathway, involves the fusion of mitochondrial inner membranes and the formation of a crista membrane through the action of the protein Mgm1. This pathway requires the protein MICOS and the dimeric form of the F1FO-ATP synthase. The other pathway, called the fusion-independent pathway, involves the import of newly synthesized proteins and lipids into the mitochondrial matrix and the formation of tubular cristae through the action of MICOS and the dimeric form of F1FO. The authors provide evidence for these two pathways through electron microscopy and biochemical analysis of mitochondria. They find that the fusion-dependent pathway is required for the maintenance of cristae and mtDNA, while the fusion-independent pathway can maintain cristae in the absence of functional MICOS complexes. They propose a model that explains how the two pathways work together to generate cristae and tubules. The results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of mitochondrial architecture and highlight the importance of understanding the relationship between mitochondrial structure and function.
The paper investigates the enzymatic activity of the NUDT9H domain of TRPM2, a transmembrane protein that is a ligand-gated ion channel. Previous studies have classified TRPM2 as a "chanzyme" based on its ability to exhibit ADPRase activity, but the authors find that NUDT9H is not an ADPRase. They use chimeric constructs that replace the NUDT9H domain with the NUDT9 sequence to test for enzymatic activity, and find that only the NUDT9H containing constructs with the Nudix box are active ADPRases. They conclude that TRPM2 is a simple ligand-gated ion channel and not a chanzyme. The paper also shows that the low solubility of NUDT9H may be due to its exposure of the C-terminus, which is not typical for soluble transmembrane proteins. The chimeric models developed in this study could be useful for future structural and biochemical studies.
The paper describes a study on the molecular characterization of avian embryos, specifically zebra finch embryos, to investigate the early stages of embryonic development and the potential for isolation of embryonic stem cells. The authors found that finch embryos at oviposition are at an early stage similar to mouse embryos around E4-E5, before epithelialization, and show expression of pluripotency markers such as Nanog, Pou5F1, and Dnmt3b. They found that pluripotency markers are expressed in finch blastoderm cells at oviposition without the need for extracellular signaling through MEK, unlike chicken blastoderm cells which require MEK inhibition. The results suggest that the finch blastoderm at oviposition is likely in a naive state, similar to the mouse naive stage, and may be a good candidate for isolation of embryonic stem cells. The study provides evidence that the naive state during amniote embryogenesis is conserved across species and may correspond to the pre-epithelialized epiblast. The study also highlights the challenges of isolating and culturing avian embryonic stem cells and the need for further advances in avian cell culture techniques to enable this.
The paper investigates how baseline hippocampal activity influences the accumulation of global amyloid beta (Aβ) in normal older adults. The authors find that baseline hippocampal activity at baseline is positively associated with increased Aβ accumulation over time. This association is mediated by the relationship between hippocampal activity and memory performance, where baseline Aβ accumulation negatively predicts memory decline. The authors find that baseline amyloid levels do not directly lead to increased hippocampal activation, but the relationship between baseline amyloid and Aβ accumulation depends on the level of hippocampal activity at baseline. The study suggests that increased hippocampal activity is one of the earliest dysfunctions in the pathological cascade of Alzheimer's disease, and that baseline Aβ accumulation may be driven by synaptic activity. The findings support the idea that increased hippocampal activation is linked to global Aβ deposition, and that baseline amyloid accumulation may be a downstream effect of hippocampal dysfunction. However, the study has some limitations, such as small sample size, missing data, and the lack of tau imaging. The authors propose that future studies could examine the role of tau in producing these effects, and incorporate longitudinal fMRI data to determine how changes in hippocampal activity track changes in Aβ accumulation.
The paper reports the results of in vivo imaging of dural lymphatic vessels in human and nonhuman primate brains using MRI techniques. The authors were able to visualize interstitial gadolinium within dural lymphatic vessels in both human and marmoset brains after injection of gadolinium-based contrast agents, indicating the existence of a dural lymphatic network. They found that gadofoset, a blood-pool contrast agent, did not reveal dural lymatics on T1-black MRI images but did on T1-weighted MPRAGE images, consistent with the idea that dural vessels lack a blood-brain barrier. They identified a branched network of lymphatics within the dura mater. The results provide evidence that at least some lymphatics are contained within the dura mater and not shared between the dura and arachnoid. The ability to image the meningeal lymphatic system noninvasively suggests the possibility of studying potential abnormalities in human neurological disorders.
The paper discusses how Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) establishes latency in its host by infecting progenitor cells of the myeloid lineage. The authors analyze single cells from latently infected CD14+ monocytes and find that cells with higher viral transcript levels show an an intrinsic, anergic-like state of monocytic cells. They identify cell surface proteins that are inversely correlated with viral gene expression, specifically MHCII and CD74, which allows sorting cells that carry higher viral loads. These cells exhibit a less immune responsive state and are more likely to reactivate, suggesting that latency maintenance and reactivation from latency is associated with a balance between immune suppression and viral transcript levels. The authors show that blocking interferon signaling increases viral gene expression, indicating that interferons repress latency. The results indicate that latency in HCMV involves an intrinsic, anergic-like state of monocytes that are less responsive to immune signals, allowing the virus to express its genes and reactivate.
The paper investigates the structure and function of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway's Axin protein. The study shows that the Axin protein, which is recruited to the receptor complex by the Dvl2 protein, is bound to the ends of Dvl2 filaments. This binding capped and/or severed Dvl2 filaments, disrupting the inter-strand interface. The Dax protein cannot form the inter-strand interface, indicating that it binds to the ends of Dxl filaments. The Dax protein binds to the ends of Dxl filaments, providing an additional binding site for Axin. The paper argues that the number of Axin molecules associated with a single Fzd receptor is optimized for efficient Wnt signaling, which is consistent with the fact that Dax has a weaker homotypic interaction than Dix. The stronger homotypic interaction between Dax and Daxin compared to Dix-Dax helps explain why Daxin disrupts Dxl filaments while Dax binds to the ends of Dxl filaments. The paper proposes that Daxin binds to the ends of Dxl filaments, providing an additional binding site for Axin, allowing it to recruit the destruction complex to the activated receptor. The study also demonstrates that Daxin binds to the ends of Dxl filaments, which is consistent with the fact that Dax has a weaker homotypic interaction compared to Dix. The number of Axin molecules associated with a single Fzd receptor is optimized for efficient Wnt signaling.
This paper investigates the mechanisms of desensitization of the G protein-coupled receptor rhodopsin. The authors find that the desensitization of rhodopsin is differentially controlled by the presence of serine and threonine residues in the receptor's C-terminus. The removal of serine residues leads to faster desensitization, while the removal of threonine residues leads to slower desensitization. The authors show that the slower desensitization of threonine residues is necessary for timely arrestin binding and activation of the G protein. The precise residues at which phosphorylation occurs have distinct mechanistic impacts on the desensitization process. The authors propose that the addition of a single serine residue at position 343 can substantially speed up arrestin binding, while the removal of native C-terminal serine residues modestly slows SPRs. The addition of a single threonine residue at position 343 can also speed up rhodopsin desensitization. The different roles of serine and threonine sites allow the receptor to produce low-noise quantal signals, which are important for tight regulation of the receptor's activity. The findings provide a clearer biophysical picture for how the coordination of phosphorylation and arrestin binding can occur to achieve timely rhodopsin desensitization.
This paper investigates the evolutionary changes in genes involved in vision and eye development in subterranean mammals that have adapted to life underground. The authors use a computational approach to identify genes that show accelerated evolution in response to the subterranean environment. They find that genes involved in vision and eye development, such as those related to photoreception, phototransduction, and eye morphology, show accelerated evolution in subterranean mammals, indicating relaxation of constraint on these genes. This is consistent with the subterranean environment placing selectively on visual pathways. Genes involved in skin and hair development also show accelerated evolution, likely as a result of the fossorial lifestyle. The authors identify specific eye-related regulatory elements that show accelerated evolution in subterranean mammals, providing evidence that eye developmental genes have relaxed constraint. The study suggests that genes involved in vision are accumulating deleterious mutations due to the relaxation of constraint in the subterranean environment, although this does not rule out the possibility that initial inactivation was adaptive. The results provide insight into the evolutionary changes underlying the visual regression observed in subterranean mammals and provide a framework for identifying regulatory elements involved in eye development.
The authors identified a new family of proteins that specifically bind lipids and are localized to the endoplasmic reticulum. They found that proteins in this family, called StART-like proteins, have a conserved domain that is targeted to the membrane through a transmembrane domain. They showed that specific StART-like proteins, like Ysp2p and Lam4p, specifically bind ergosterol, and that loss of these proteins causes sensitivity to drugs that extract ergosterol from the ER membrane. They showed that the StART-like domain of Ysp2p is sufficient for its function, but it requires being anchored to the ER membrane to function. They propose that StART-like proteins act as lipid transfer proteins that mediate transfer of lipids between the ER and PM.
The paper presents a detailed analysis of the structure and mechanism of the AcrB AcrB-TolC transport system, a secondary transporter that mediates efflux of drugs from the periplasmic space into the inner membrane of Escherichia coli. The authors use a combination of crystal structures, molecular dynamics simulations, and electrostatic calculations to show that the transmembrane domain of AcrB consists of two structural repeats, R1 and R2, which are coupled through ionic interactions with K940 and R971. During the transport cycle, the ionic interactions between K940 and R971 weaken, allowing the repeats R1 and R2 to move relative to each other, thereby facilitating the formation of water channels that alternately access the periplasmic and cytoplasmic sides of the transmembrane domain. This alternating access mechanism is necessary for harnessing the electrochemical gradient energy to power the peristaltic pump mechanism of the porter domain. The authors propose that the conformational changes in the transmembrane domain are coupled to the protonation state of D407 and D408, which in turn drives the lateral displacement of R2 relative to R1. The results provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of the antiport mechanism of AcrB and highlight the importance of structural coupling between protomers in maximizing the conformational changes to achieve the most efficient transport pathway. The findings may aid the development of novel pharmacological approaches against Gram-negative multidrug resistant pathogens.
The paper examines the within-host and global evolution of influenza viruses in immunocompromised patients. The authors analyze deep sequencing data from 4 immunocompromised patients who developed long-term H3N2 influenza infections. They find that a small set of beneficial mutations repeatedly arise within individual patients and across multiple patients, indicating parallel evolution at both within-host and global scales. The mutations arise at sites that vary between hosts, but also reach high frequencies at sites that vary globally, suggesting that the same beneficial mutations are selected at both levels. The authors suggest that this parallelism may emerge from the confluence of several evolutionary conditions, including concordant selection, a constrained evolutionary landscape, and high mutation rates over time. The findings contrast with prior studies that found limited within-host variation in acute influenza infections. The study suggests that within-host viral diversity may serve as an early measurement of global evolution, shaped by immunological and evolutionary constraints, and high-throughput sequencing will be increasingly valuable for understanding how these constraints interact.
The paper discusses the role of a protein called Mon1-Ccz1 in the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes. Autophagosomes are membranous structures that engulf cellular components and degrade them through autophagy. Mon1-Ccz1 is a GEF (guanine nucleotide exchange factor) that recruits the Rab7-like protein Ypt7 to the autophagosome surface, which in turn activates the HOPS tethering complex and triggers SNARE-mediated fusion. The authors identified a conserved C-terminal LIR (Lysine-Iso-Arg) motif in Mon1-Ccz1 that is responsible for targeting it to the autophagosome surface. They found that the LIR1 and LIR2 mutants, which have mutations in the LIR motifs, still allow autophagy but have impaired fusion with lysosomes. However, membrane-localized Atg8, but not soluble Atg8, is able to recruit Mon1-Ccz1 to the autophagosome surface. This suggests that lipidated Atg8 is the primary determinant for Mon1-Ccz1 localization to the autophagosome. The study reveals that Mon1-Ccz1 has a dual role and can target different organelles through different mechanisms. The identification of Atg8 as a determinant for Mon1-Ccz1 localization to autophagosomes provides an example of how a GEF can be diverted to a different location, allowing cells to operate distinct pathways.
The paper describes a new type of microscope objective lens called the Mesolens that can image large biological specimens with subcellular resolution while maintaining a large field of view. The Mesolens achieves this by correcting for spherical aberration in the objectives and has a numerical aperture of 0.6. This allows it to image thick tissue specimens with subcellular resolution through the entire volume. The Mesolens was designed and constructed using known techniques and can be used in laser scanning confocal microscopy and wide-field epi-fluorescence. It has demonstrated the ability to image large specimens with subcellular resolution throughout their entire thickness, including individual cells in deep tissues. The Mesolens can also switch between laser scanning mode and high-speed camera mode, which is not possible with standard objectives. The Mesolens has a high optical throughput and can generate large 3D datasets, making it suitable for many applications. The authors believe that the Mesolens has the potential to transform optical microscopy by allowing subcellular resolution 3D datasets from large tissue specimens.
This paper investigates how the proportion of macrophages derived from the yolk sac changes in the kidney with age. The authors use two approaches to label macrophages in mice: one that labels all hematopoietic cells and another that labels only macrophages derived from the yolk sac. They find that the proportion of macrophages derived from the yolk sac increases significantly in the kidney with age, especially in the cortex and outer medulla. This increase is observed in both CSF1R-labelled and CX3CR1-labelled macrophages. They suggest two possible mechanisms for this increase: the proliferation of existing yolk-sac-derived macrophages and recruitment of new macrophages from the circulation. The results provide a foundation for future studies to investigate how the age-related heterogeneity of macrophages in the kidney may contribute to increased susceptibility to kidney diseases.
The paper describes how the Toxoplasma gondii microbe infects and alters neurons within the central nervous system, with the majority of infected neurons showing abnormal electrophysiology. The authors used a Cre-based mouse model where neurons were injected with the GFP protein to map neuron locations and found that TINs (Toxoplasma infected neurons) are primarily found in the cortex and striatum. TINs co-localized with markers for inhibitory interneurons like calbindin and parvalbumin, but not as frequently as expected with excitatory markers like FoxP2. Electrophysiology studies showed that striatal TINs were likely medium spiny neurons, while bystander neurons showed only mild changes in resting membrane potential and firing properties. The number of TINs decreased by 90% by 8 weeks post-infection, suggesting that they were dying. The findings suggest that neurons injected with Toxoplasma have highly aberrant electrophysiology and may die relatively quickly, while bystander neurons show only minor changes. The results challenge the current understanding that microbes persist in neurons through non-cytolytic clearance or latent infection, and instead suggest that the death of TINs may be essential for parasite control. The study offers an alternative model where neurons mount appropriate immune responses to both cytokines and infections, resulting in limited persistent infection being a rare outcome.
The paper describes an experiment using optogenetic stimulation to study the mechanisms of synaptic vesicle exocytosis and endocytosis at the neuromuscular junctions of the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. The authors used a genetically modified channelrhodopsin to express in acetylcholine neurons to stimulate neurotransmitter release with a single light pulse. They froze the neurons immediately after stimulation and imaged the synapses using transmission electron microscopy. They found that synaptic vesicles fused to the plasma membrane along the entire face of the synapse, from the dense projection to the adherens junctions. Only docked vesicles, which were in contact with the plasma membrane, fused in response to the stimulus. Vesicles within 30 nm of the membrane were not observed. Endocytic structures were found at the dense projection and adherens junctions, but were resolved into large vesicles within 50 ms. They propose that ultrafast endocytosis occurs at these sites, which is fast enough to account for the number of vesicles that fuse during neurotransmission. They argue that the readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles, which can be stimulated by a single action potential, is likely the morphologically docked pool, and that the refilling rate of this pool is consistent with their observations. They suggest that endocytosis at the dense projection and adherens junctions is the sites for the readily releasable pool and kiss-and-run endocytosis.
This paper discusses the potential for using ligands that bind to the hydrophobic cavity between immunoglobulin light chain dimers to inhibit the formation of amyloid fibrils. The authors identified four ligands that bind the dimer interface and hinder amyloid fibril formation, with methylene blue being the most effective. They showed that the ligands bind specifically to the dimers and do not bind to monomers, using techniques such as equilibrium dialysis, crystal structures, and analytical ultracentrifugation. The crystal structures of methylene blue and sulfasalazine bound to the dimer show that the ligands bind at the A-site and C-site of the dimer, respectively. The results suggest that the secondary binding site of methylene blue may not be available in crystals but is present in solution. The approach of stabilizing the dimer interface could be effective for full-length immunoglobulins, which have a similar tertiary structure and hydrophobic pocket. The ability to inhibit amyloid fibril formation using ligands indicates a promising approach for treating systemic light chain amyloidosis, although the specific ligands used in this study may not be directly applicable as drugs.
The paper discusses the molecular mechanisms underlying the entry of sporozoites from Plasmodium parasites into human liver cells. The authors identify two host cell surface receptors, CD81 and SR-BI, which are required for the entry of sporozoites into human hepatocytes. They show that sporozoites can use either CD81 or SR-BI to infect hepatocytes, but not both receptors are required for the entry. They identify the 6-cysteine domain protein P36 as a critical parasite factor that determines host receptor usage. P36 mediates CD81-dependent entry for Plasmodium berghei sporozoites, while P52 mediates SR-BI-dependent entry for Plasmodium yoelii sporozoites. The authors also identify PbP36 as a key determinant of CD81-dependent entry. The study reveals that PbP36 contains structural determinants that interact with SR-BI, but not CD81. The identification of P36 as a host receptor determinant may pave the way for the development of novel malaria vaccines targeting SR-BI.
This paper discusses the role of two genes, otp and otpb, in the development of hypothalamic oxytocin neurons in zebrafish. The otp gene regulates the migration and differentiation of diencephalic neurons, while otpb does not. Zebrafish mutants with mutations in either otp or otpb display defects in social behavior and anxiety-like responses. The paper found that otp mutants display a new cluster of hypothalamic oxytocin neurons in the posterior tuberculum that expresses oxytocin receptor but not oxytocin mRNA. The otp gene negatively regulates the expression of oxytocin in the posterior tuberculum while otpb positively regulates it. The paper also found that ablating these posterior tuberculum oxytocin neurons leads to a long-term defect in social behavior in adult zebrafish, but not anxiety-like behavior. The paper suggests that the social behavior defects in otp mutants are likely due to the mutant's developmental impairments. The study highlights the complex genetic interactions between the two otp paralogs and the role of oxytocin neurons in modulating social behavior.
The paper describes an analysis of measles mortality rates in India using the Million Death Study, a nationally representative survey of all deaths in India. The study found that a mass measles immunization campaign launched in 2010 aimed at children aged 9 months to 10 years resulted in a significant decline in measles mortality rates among children aged 1-59 months. Measles mortality rates declined by 12% to 27% in campaign states and 1% to 1% in non-campaign states. The campaign led to a 41,000-5,0000 to 56,0000 reduction in estimated measles deaths in India during 2010-2013, with 39-57% of these deaths occurring in campaign states. The campaign was particularly effective for girls, who had higher measles mortality rates than boys. The study demonstrates that measles immunization can significantly reduce measles deaths in India, though elimination of measles transmission is difficult due to its high infectivity. The campaign's success suggests that efforts to improve vaccine coverage will curtail measles mortality. The findings provide evidence that measles mortality can be eliminated in India, though it will require continued mass immunization and monitoring.
The paper investigates the role of on-task and off-task replay in a state-based decision-making task. The authors found that on-task replay of experienced trajectories, which can facilitate model-based planning, is more strongly associated with higher flexibility. On-task replay was found to encode sequences of states following outcomes, particularly following surprising outcomes, which tended to be replayed during rest periods. Off-task replay, which can establish a model-free policy, was found to be associated with lower flexibility. The authors suggest that off-task replay may be less effective for tasks that require trial-to-trial flexibility, while on-task replay may be more useful for tasks that require model-based reasoning. The results provide new insights into how humans replay and plan their choices.
The paper discusses how the bacterial second messenger cyclic di-GMP is generated heterogeneously within populations of the bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The authors used a genetically encoded FRET-based biosensor to measure c-di-GMP levels in individual cells and found that around 20% of cells exhibit c-di-GMP concentrations below 20 nM. They identified the enzyme Pch as the source of this heterogeneity by showing that Pch-mCherry localizes to the cell pole in a manner that is dependent on the chemotaxis machinery CheA. The chemotaxis machinery also requires CheA to maintain low c-di-GMP levels. The authors propose that Pch binds to an unidentified adaptor protein that mediates the interaction between Pch and CheA. The CheA-Pch interaction confers polar localization of Pch to the cell pole following cell division. The authors found that only CheA and not the flagellar apparatus is required for the maintenance of low c-di-GMP levels. They also showed that reducing c-di-GMP levels in motile cells increased their velocity and reversals, indicating that c-di-GMP heterogeneity confers diversity in cellular behavior. The results suggest that population-level c-di-GMP heterogeneity may be a mechanism by which bacteria generate diversity within populations.
The paper investigates the role of the switch II glutamate residue in the activation of Rab GTPases, a subfamily of Ras-related GTPases that play important roles in controlling membrane trafficking between organelles in eukaryotic cells. The authors find that while the conserved switch II glutamate residue in the Rab GTPases interacts with the P-loop lysine of the GEF to promote GDP release, it also interacts with the GAP to aid GTP hydrolysis and activate the Rab. However, the switch II glutamine mutation in Rab35Q67A has different effects on GEF-mediated nucleotide exchange and GAP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis, suggesting that the same glutamine residue interacts with different regions in different GEFs and GAPs. The results indicate that different GEFs activate Rabs via distinct pathways, and a single Rab can follow different activation pathways depending on its cognate GEF. This plasticity in Rab activation mechanisms has implications for the interpretation of previous studies on Rab function, as switch II glutamine mutants may behave differently depending on the nature of the GEF. The findings also raise the possibility of developing small molecule inhibitors that target these mechanistically discrete pathways. The study uncovers plasticity in the different pathways leading to Rab activation, where a single Rab can follow different activation pathways depending on its cognate GEF.
This paper describes a multimodal approach to study receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. The authors used three methods to analyze EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation and SH2 domain binding in the EGFR-overexpressing A431 cell line: far-Western blotting, iTRAQ mass spectrometry, and in vivo imaging of plasma membrane SH2 domain recruitment. While the methods showed some differences in results, they were able to gain complementary insights into the relationship between tyrosine phosphorylation, SH2 domain binding, and membrane recruitment. The far-Western approach provided a global view of changes in SH2 binding sites, while iTRAQ identified individual phosphosites. In vivo imaging showed that SH2 recruitment kinetics lagged behind SH2 binding site creation, which was consistent with clustering of phosphosites. This lag was found to be more pronounced for SH2 domains that bound GAB1. The authors propose that clustering of phosphites may play a role in the apparent delay in SH2 recruitment, potentially diversifying receptor signaling kinetics. The study highlights the advantages of using multiple methods to gain a full picture of molecular events downstream of receptor activation.
The paper examines the evolution of apicomplexan parasites, which include Toxoplasma gondii and Plasmodium falciparum, using the genomes of their free-living ancestor Chromera veliaformis and the apicomplexan species Vitrella brassicaformis. The authors analyzed the genomes to determine how the apicomplexan parasites evolved from their free-living ancestor. They found that the proto-apicomplexan ancestor possessed many genes involved in metabolic processes, including photosynthesis, sterol biosynthesis, and cellular metabolism. The proto-apicplexan ancestor still had a complete repertoire of endomembrane trafficking components and flagellar apparatus components, indicating that these were present in the free-living ancestor. The apicomplexan ancestor then lost genes involved in photosynthesis and sterol biosynthesis but still had a full complement of endomembrane trafficking components. Apicomplexan lineages lost genes involved in cellular metabolism and gained genes involved in host-cell invasion. The proto-apicplexan ancestor possessed genes involved in host invasion, suggesting that some genes were already present in the free-living ancestor and were repurposed for the parasitic lifestyle. Chromera and Vitrella genomes allowed the authors to reconstruct the free-living ancestor of apicomplexans. The authors found that genes involved in host invasion were gained at different evolutionary stages and were overrepresented among genes gained after Stage III, suggesting adaptation to specific hosts.
The paper investigates how the barrel cortex in the mouse brain encodes sensory information during active tactile sensation. The authors record spiking activity from excitatory neurons in the barrel cortex during a whisker-based object localization task, where mice use their whiskers to locate an object. They find that most spikes are temporally coupled to the onset of touch and only a small number of spikes are coupled to whisker phase, indicating that the spike train is highly precise and encodes touch information with minimal noise. They estimate the Fano factor, which measures the variance in spike count compared to the mean spike rate, and find that it is close to the theoretical minimum, indicating low noise. This suggests that the barrel cortex neurons exhibit low variability in their spiking activity. The authors conclude that the barrel cortex neurons encode touch information with millisecond precision and minimal noise, which is different from previous studies that found high variability in spike trains in other cortical layers. This suggests that the barrel cortex may use temporally precise and low-variance spiking to perform computations. The results provide insights into how the brain encodes and processes sensory information during active sensation.
The paper presents a comprehensive analysis of genomic instability in acute precursor B-cell leukemias using global run-on sequencing (GRO-seq) data. The study aims to identify mechanisms underlying secondary genetic alterations that occur in precursor B cells, which are often characterized by few mutations. The authors find that convergence of transcription and poly(ADP-stalling) strongly associates with recurrent breakpoints across the genome. They show that both poly(AD) stalling and R-loop rich regions co-localize with breakpoints and have increased DNA accessibility. The top 5% of widest poly(AD) stalling regions are characterized by unusually broad DNAse hypersensitivity and H3K4me3 signal. The authors propose that locally depleased nucleosomes around the poly(AD) complex may enhance access to R-loop rich regions. They find that high expression of AID and RAG1/2 is distinct between different subtypes of precursor B-ALL and is associated with high-risk cases. The study demonstrates that transcription-coupled genetic instability has relevance in multiple cancer types.
The paper discusses the results of experiments conducted on macaque monkeys to investigate the behavior of eye movements during fixation. The experiments showed that eye movements during fixation, called "ocular position drifts", exhibit rapid modulations in speed and direction that are stimulus-driven and binocular. These modulations occur within 80-140 milliseconds of stimulus onset and are sufficient to move images across individual cone photoreceptors in the fovea or multiple rod photoreceptors in the peripheral zones. The authors conclude that these drifts are not random and are controlled by the brain, but are not fully explained by current models of random walk processes. They propose that low spatial frequency stimuli increase the uncertainty of intended gaze position, which allows the activation of more neurons in the upper visual field. This could explain the observed orientation tuning of the drift response. The authors suggest that the drift response could serve a functional role in modulating visual statistics during fixation, perhaps to enhance edges and equalize spectral content. The results provide evidence that the brain has some level of central control over these eye movements and are consistent with existing work showing that drifts are not fully random.
The paper describes a new method to study the dynamics of heterochromatin silencing in yeast. The authors created a Cre-based assay that allows them to detect when a gene is transiently expressed and then switches to a permanently repressed state. They used this assay to measure the frequency of silencing loss in wild-type cells and compare it to cells that lack individual sirtuin genes or histone genes. They found that silencing loss was transient and occurred at a low rate, indicating that silencing is constantly re-established. The histone H3-K56 acetylation appears to stabilize silencing, but the authors could not fully determine why silencing in histone H3-K56 mutants was less stable at early stages of colony growth. The assay revealed that silencing loss occurred more frequently in cells lacking Sir1, indicating Sir1 contributes to silencing maintenance or inheritance. The results suggest that silencing dynamics are dynamic and involve stochastic processes, and the stability of silencing depends on the level of sirtuin expression. The ability to visualize silencing loss in real time provides a new tool to study heterochromatin dynamics and their impact on mating-type interconversion.
The paper discusses how cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain and brainstem promote waking, while cholinergic fibers in the TRN promote sleep onset and protection. The authors used optogenetics to selectively activate cholinergic neurons or GABAergic neurons in the TRN in mice and measured their effects on sleep. They found that cholinergic fibers in the TRN, but not cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain, activated GABAergic neurons via α7-containing nicotinic cholinergic receptors, leading to increased spindle oscillations and longer NREM sleep. Direct stimulation of GABAergic neurons in the TRN also produced similar effects, indicating that cholinergic input to the TRN can promote sleep onset and protection through GABAergic neurons. The results suggest that cholinergic input to the TRN plays a key role in regulating sleep-waking cycles, particularly through the activation of GABAergic neurons. The authors propose that excitation of cholinergic fibers in the TRN activates GABAergic neurons through α7-nAChRs, leading to bursts of action potentials and spindle oscillations that stabilize sleep. The study provides new insight into cholinergic roles in mediating biological rhythms and may have implications for sleep disorders.
The paper describes how the researchers used single-cell RNA sequencing to identify and characterize the heterogeneity of the endothelium in the adult lung. They found that the lung contains multiple subtypes of endothelial cells, including microvascular endothelial cells, mesenchymal cells, and macrovascular endothelial cells. They identified a new subpopulation of cells called Car4-high endothelial cells that are enriched in the regenerating zones following acute lung injury. These Car4-high cells express high levels of Vegfr2 and Ednrb and Kdr, suggesting they may play a specialized role in gas exchange. The researchers found that both Car4-high cells and other endothelial cells proliferate after lung injury, with Car4-high cells expressing high levels of Vegfr1, indicating they may signal to other endothelial subtypes. Gene expression analysis showed that Car4-high cells are primed for vasculogenesis and blood vessel development. The emergence of a highly proliferative endothelial population after injury suggests that endothelial cells, rather than a progenitor population, contribute to lung repair. The study provides new insights into the cellular mechanisms by which the endothelium contributes to alveolar regeneration and gas exchange following lung injury.
This paper investigates the role of internal thioester proteins in adhering to host cells, specifically fibrinogen. Internal thioester proteins are found in many Gram-positive bacteria and are thought to mediate pathogen adhesion to hosts by forming covalent bonds. The authors identify thioester domain-containing proteins in 124 different species of Gram-positive bacteria. They express thioester domain-containing proteins in E. coli and purify them to homogeneity. They find that the SfbI protein from Streptococococcus pyogenes is able to covalently bond to fibrinogen through its thioester domain, forming a stable adduct that is dependent on the thioester. They show that this interaction is specific for fibrinogen Lysine 10. They demonstrate that SfbI-TED binding to fibrinogen depends on the thioester domain and not any other Lysine residues on fibrinogen. They also show that SfbI-TEDs are able to adhere to epithelial cells and form a biofilm-like structure on the surface of epithelial cells after incubation with fibrinogen. They propose that fibrinogen may play an unappreciated role as a host-surface adhesion target for bacteria, and that thioester-dependent covalent adhesion may be a common mechanism for pathogen-host interactions.
This paper investigates the evolutionary history of sex pheromone receptors in moths. The authors focus on a specific OR gene, SlitOR5, which expresses in male antennae and responds to a major component of the sex pheromone blend of the noctuid moth Spodoptera littoralis. Previous studies have shown that type I PRs are tuned to type I pheromones, but this gene does not group with the previously defined PR clade. The authors demonstrate that SlitOR5 is the receptor for the major component of the S. littoralis pheromone blend by showing that it expresses in male antenna, responds to the pheromone in heterologous expression systems, and mutant males lacking the gene have defects in detecting the pheromone. They also show that SlitOR5 is part of a distinct lineage that contains other sex-biased ORs from different families of Lepidoptera. The findings suggest that type I PRs have evolved at least twice in Lepidoptera, with the SlitOR5 lineage representing a novel PR clade. This is supported by a phylogenetic analysis of ORs showing SlitOR5 in a distinct lineage from the PR clade. The results suggest that the evolution of PRs may have occurred independently in different Lepidoptera families, with the SlitOR5 lineage representing a novel PR clade.
The paper discusses the possibility that the protein annexin 1 (ANO1) may not be the primary protein responsible for phosphatidylserine scrambling (PLS) as previously thought. The authors propose that anion channel annexin 6 (ANO6) may be the scramblase protein instead. They find that expression of O6 in HEK cells induces Ca2+-dependent PLS, while ionic currents generated by O6 are activated concurrently with PLS and exhibit similar ion selectivity. They also find that mutating certain amino acids in O6 that confer PLS activity on ANO1 abolishes O6 currents. The authors propose that the ionic currents generated by O6 are essentially leak currents and may be flowing along the same pathway as the phospholip scrambling. They also show that ion channel blockers do not affect O6 currents, suggesting that the ionic conductance pathway is different from the phospholip translocation pathway. They construct chimeras of O1 and O6 to test for PLS activity and find that some chimeras with O6 sequences in the scrambling domain (SCD) exhibit PLS activity. The homology model of O6 suggests that the SCD forms a unique structure that may be involved in lipid scrambling. These findings support the idea that O6 is the scramblase protein. However, the authors acknowledge that the expression level of O6 is not sufficient to fully explain PLS and suggest that additional components may be required.
The paper investigates whether nephrogenesis (formation of nephrons, the functional units of the kidney) influences ureteric branching morphogenesis. The authors find that nephrogenesis does not influence the rate of ureteric branching, tip proliferation, or the distribution of branching along the ureteric tree. They find that almost all tips have an attached nephron by 72 hours after branching begins, and that tips with nephrons continue to undergo bifurcation. Analysis of whole kidney sections at E15.5 shows no correlation between the number of nephrons and branching history. The authors conclude that the branching morphogenesis in the kidney is distinct from that in the mammary gland and more similar to that in the lung, where reciprocal epithelial-mesenchymal interactions drive the process. They propose a model where branching morphogenesis is driven by an internal clock in nephron progenitor cells rather than by the presence of nephrons.
The paper presents a study on the mechanism of vesicle tethering by a Golgi network associated protein, GCC185. The authors show that GCC185 uses an unexpected mechanism to accomplish vesicle tethering. They find that the N-terminus of GCC185, rather than the C-terminus, is the primary region that binds vesicles. The N-terminus is flexible, allowing it to capture vesicles by binding near the hinge region and collapse onto the Golgi surface, bringing them close to the target membrane. The central bubble in GCC185 provides additional flexibility. The results suggest that Golgins are shorter than previously predicted and contain splayed ends that can capture vesicles. The AP-1 binding site in GCC185 is essential for vesicle tethering but not Golgi ribbon maintenance. The study argues against the traditional view that tethers extend rigid rods from the Golgi surface, instead proposing a flexible collapse model where vesicles bind near the bubble and engage both AP1 and Rab9 binding sites. The study highlights the complexity of how tethers function, showing that GCC185 is more potent in vesicle tethering than Golgi ribbon assembly.
The paper proposes a new JavaScript-based framework called Artistoo for building and sharing cellular Potts models, which can run in a web browser without the need for software installation. This framework is designed to provide an alternative to existing C++-based frameworks that require installation. The authors claim that recent advances in JavaScript engines have made JavaScript sufficient for running simulations, and that Artistoo's zero-install approach opens up new opportunities for sharing simulations with a broader audience, enabling interactive exploration and teaching. They demonstrate this by showing that Artistoo's performance is comparable to existing C++ frameworks in terms of simulation speed. The authors also discuss how Artistoo can complement existing frameworks like CompuCell3D, Morpheus, and Tissue Simulation Toolkit, allowing users to build explorable simulations and explanations in a web setting that can be shared via a URL. They hope that Artistoo will enable more accessible sharing and communication of computational models, enabling a broader audience to explore and understand the results of cellular Potts models.
This paper analyzed data from newly diagnosed Parkinson's disease patients and age-matched controls using diffusion-weighted MRI and resting-state functional MRI to identify regions of atrophy in the brain. They found that the regions showing atrophy in the Parkinson's patients corresponded to one intrinsic brain network identified using seed-based functional connectivity mapping and independent component analysis. The authors also showed that the atrophy in these regions was related to the disease severity of the disease and correlated with dopamine denervation measured with SPECT. They propose that Parkinson's disease targets a set of connected brain regions, consistent with the network-spread hypothesis, and that the substantia nigra is likely the propagator of the disease to the supratentorial brain. They also showed that the atrophy pattern identified in the Parkinson's patients corresponded to a normal intrinsic brain network identified by seed-based functional connectivity mapping and ICA. This supports the idea that Parkinson's disease targets a set of connected brain regions, consistent with the network-spread hypothesis.
This paper investigates how the bacterial protein H-NS (Histone-like Nucleoid Structuring protein) binds DNA and how its function is modulated by environmental factors. The authors find that H-NS binds DNA in a "bridged" mode, where two H-NS dimers are bridged together along the DNA molecule, resulting in DNA stiffening. However, H-NS cannot stiffen DNA as dimers. Instead, H-NS is "activated" by divalent cations (Mg2+ and K+) which promotes a conformational change allowing the two H-NS dimers to interact in a "closed" conformation, enabling DNA bridging. The authors show that H-NS binding modes are modulated by ion concentrations and cooperativity, and that H-NS is inhibited by interactions with other proteins like Hha and YdgT. The findings suggest that the modulation of H-NS function is complex, involving multiple steps and mechanisms, and that different types of H-NS-DNA complexes are likely formed depending on the ion and DNA conditions. The paper adds to the understanding of how H-NS regulates gene expression, providing clues for rational design of inhibitors of H-NS function.
The paper investigates the role of R-spondins in regulating the maintenance of nephron progenitors during kidney development. R-spondins are found to be required for the proliferation and differentiation of nephron progenitors. The authors show that R-spondins are required for the activation of WNT/β-caten signalling in nephron progenitors, which is necessary for their maintenance and differentiation. R-spondins are expressed in both the stromal and nephron progenitor compartments, but stromal R-spondin expression shifts to a predominantly stromal expression at later stages. The loss of R-spondins leads to a reduction in nephron progenitors and an inability to undergo differentiation, indicating that R-sponds are essential for this process. The authors also show that LGR4, but not LGR5/6, mediates R-spondin activity in nephron progenitors. They propose that low levels of β-caten signalling in uncommitted progenitors allows for the activation of class II genes, while high levels of β-catenin signalling in progenitors allows for the activation of class I genes. The results suggest that R-sponds are required to maintain the nephrogenic niche during development and that changes in R-spond expression or function may be associated with renal disorders.
The authors investigated the role of the protein soluble form of vascular endothelial growth factor (sFLT-1) in maintaining the vascular barrier between the photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium in the retina. They found that sFLT-1 is downregulated in the retina of mice with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and that this downregulation leads to choroidal neovascularization and retinal angiomatous proliferation. They also showed that inhibiting sFLT-1 expression by neutralizing antibodies or gene ablation of FLT-1 in the retinal pigment epithelium or photoreceptors leads to choroidal neovascularization and retinal angiomatous proliferation. This suggests that sFLT-1 plays a key role in maintaining the subretinal vascular barrier and that disrupting this barrier leads to retinal degeneration. The results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying retinal vascular demarcations and may inform the development of new therapies for AMD.
The paper describes the discovery of a new cell size regulator in the unicellular eukaryote Chlamydomonas reinhardti, called CDKG1. CDKG1 functions in the S/M phase of the cell cycle to regulate the number of cell divisions based on mother cell size. CDKG1 protein levels are cell cycle-regulated, scaling with cell size in an allometric manner, where large cells produce more CDKG1 than smaller cells. CDKG1 protein is produced just before S/M phase and is diluted with each round of cell division. CDKG1 misexpression causes a small cell phenotype. The study suggests that CDKG1 is a limiting component of the S/M cell size control mechanism and that its abundance is tightly controlled. CDKG1 protein levels are sensitive to mother cell size, with large mother cells producing higher levels, and CDKG1 protein being diluted with each round of division.
The paper describes a new organoid model system called Somitoids that recapitulates functional, morphological, and molecular features of paraxial mesoderm (PM) development, including the formation of somite-like structures, in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). The authors optimized a protocol to generate 50 cells as the initial number for aggregation and then treat them with signaling pathway modulators to induce somite fate. They identified optimal conditions by screening different initial cell numbers and modulators that reproducibly yielded somite-like structures. The optimized protocol was then used to differentiate Somitoids towards sclerotome and dermomyotome derivatives. The Somitoid system was found to be reproducible, scalable, and suitable for systematic analysis of human somite formation and PM development. The scRNA-seq analysis showed that the Somitoid system faithfully recapitulates the gene regulatory programs of human PM development and generates mature somite-like cells that express the full repertoire of known marker genes. The Somitoid system also exhibits spatial and molecular features similar to in size and composition to human embryonic somites. The authors believe that the Somitoid system could serve as a versatile platform to study congenital diseases linked to the human segmentation clock and somite formation, as well as the regulation of somite formation using CRISPR/Cas9 or small molecule inhibitors.
This paper presents a high-performance brain-computer interface (BCI) that uses a point-and-click interface to enable typing and communication for people with motor impairment. The BCI was developed using techniques from previous studies, including the ReFIT Kalman Filter and Hidden Markov Model state classifier. The BCI was tested on three participants with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal cord injury, who achieved typing rates of 31-6 characters per minute, significantly higher than previous BCIs tested on people with motor impairment. The BCI was able to suppress the participants' natural movements, indicating that the high performance was not due to the participants' ability to generate hand movements. The BCI was able to achieve both continuous control and discrete selection, which is important for practical applications. The results demonstrate that intracortical BCIs offer a promising approach for assistive communication systems for people with paralysis.
The study identifies a population of neurons in the anterior-ventral pretectum (AF7-prectum) of zebrafish larvae that control the initiation of predatory behavior. These neurons, called KalTA4u50 pretectal neurons, are specifically activated during hunting initiation and are capable of evoking predatory behavior in the absence of any visual cues. Optogenetic stimulation of individual KalTA4u50 neurons could induce sustained hunting routines with high probability. The KalTA4u50 population is found to be a command system that recruits premotor circuits downstream of perception. Ablation of KalTA4u50 neurons impaired but did not eliminate hunting, suggesting that they are required for normal predatory behavior. The study suggests that the AF7-prectum-pretectum pathway plays a key role in linking perception of prey and motor generation of predatory behavior.
The paper describes a practical application of active learning to determine how multiple proteins change their subcellular localization patterns in response to multiple chemical compounds. The authors constructed an atlas of unperturbed protein localization patterns by extensive CD-tagging in NIH-3T3 cells, chose 48 different clones representing a broad range of localization patterns, and formed a library of 48 compounds suspected to affect subcellular trafficking. They performed 30 rounds of active learning, where the active learner selected experiments to test the greatest number of groupings of drugs or clones, while minimizing experiments that could be predicted from each other. The active learner was able to accurately predict phenotypes for unobserved experiments, and identify 51 distinct phenotypes. The phenotypes were then used to cluster into groups based on similar subcellular patterns. The authors found that nearly all drugs elicited noticeable changes to protein localization patterns, and some enhanced secretory localization while others suppressed ER localization. The results demonstrate the feasibility of active learning for complex, large-scale experiments and show that the active learner was able to generalize to proteins it had not observed. The paper highlights some challenges and limitations, including the need for better image quality control and the need to directly assess differences in measurement results for different experiments. The approach could potentially be used to predict drug/target interactions more efficiently.
The paper discusses how the maternal-zygotic transition in mouse embryos involves extensive changes in gene expression and epigenetics, including the activation of endogenous retroviruses. The authors use single-cell RNA sequencing to investigate the role of the maternally inherited factor Stella in this transition. They find that Stella knockout embryos have failed to activate endogenous retroviruses, specifically the LTR-ERVL family, and exhibit widespread misregulation of transposable elements. The misregulation of transposable elements is associated with reduced expression of genes involved in ribosome biogenesis and RNA processing. The authors propose that Stella regulates the activation of a subset of transposable elements through chimeric transcripts, which are misregulated in the absence of Stella. Reducing the expression of the MuERV-L retroviral element at the 2-cell stage hinders developmental progression, suggesting that MuERV-L has a functional role during early mouse development. The study highlights the importance of endogenous retroviruses in early mammalian development and identifies a maternal factor that regulates their activation during the maternal-zygotic transition.
This paper investigates the neural circuits involved in the formation of long-term appetitive olfactory memory in Drosophila melanogaster. The authors find that a recurrent circuit consisting of dopamine neurons and a single output neuron, MBON-α1, is essential for the formation of appetitive long-term memory. The dopamine neurons provide reward signals that are reinforced by the output of the MBON-α1 neuron to the reward-sensing dopamine neurons in the mushroom body. The dopamine neurons are required in the Kenyon cells of the α/β lobe, and the output of MBON-α1 provides feedback to the reward-sensing dopamine neurons. The authors show that blocking the output of MBON-α1 during conditioning impairs long-term memory formation, while blocking the output of the α/β lobe during conditioning does not significantly impair short-term memory. The authors propose a feedback circuit consisting of the α/β lobe, MBON-α, and PAM-α1 neurons that mediates the reinforcement signals from the dopamine neurons to the reward-sensing dopamine neurons, providing an ongoing activity during early stages of memory consolidation. The authors also find that the specificity of long-term memory is compromised, as long-term memory is less specific to the trained odor compared to short-term memory.
The paper presents a detailed molecular and biophysical study of the recognition of the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) repeat of Plasmodium falciparum by the mouse mAb 3D1. The authors used molecular dynamics simulations, biolayer interferometry, surface plasmon resonance, and cryo-electron microscopy to study the binding of mAb3D1 to the CSP repeat. They found that mAb3D1 binds the CSP repeat in an extended conformation and recognizes different CSP repeats in a similar way. The binding of mAb3D1 to the CSP repeat induces a spiral conformation of the protein. They identified key residues involved in the binding of mAb3D1, including germline-encoded residues and somatic mutations. They showed that mAb3D1 is cross-reactive with different CSP repeats, consistent with previous studies. The spiral structure of the CSP repeat observed upon mAb binding is similar to that observed upon binding of human mAb 3D1. The study provides insights into the mechanisms employed by CSP-targeting antibodies to inhibit sporozoite development and infection of hepatocytes. The results demonstrate that homotypic interactions are an important feature of the mammalian immune response to CSP, mediated by germline-encoded residues.
The paper uses CyTOF to analyze phenotypic and functional features of T cells from 1165 individuals who received either one or two doses of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, including both previously infected and uninfected individuals. The study found that T cells from infected individuals exhibit a different response to the vaccine-elicited spike protein epitopes compared to those from uninfected individuals. Infected individuals exhibited a weaker response to the vaccine-elicited spike epitopes, with a higher frequency of long-lived memory T cells and cells that migrated to mucosal sites. In contrast, T cells from uninfected individuals showed a stronger response to the epitopes, with more proliferative T cells. The study suggests that vaccine-elicited T cells from infected individuals have a different phenotype than those from uninfected individuals, which may be related to the persistence of pre-existing T cells from the original infection. The findings indicate that the vaccine may have a different impact on T cell responses in infected vs uninfected individuals, and could potentially lead to differences in immune protection.
The paper presents a model that reconciles two seemingly conflicting observations about the function of the transcription factor MYC. While some studies suggest that MYC regulates a broad range of genes, others propose that MYC amplifies gene expression by binding to all promoters. The authors propose that the actual mechanism of MYC binding to chromatin is more complex and involves interactions with other factors that depend on existing gene expression patterns. They show that the binding affinity of promoters to MYC can stratify genes into different functional groups. Promoters with high binding affinity for MYC are most strongly occupied by MYC, while promoters with low binding affinity are only occupied at high MYC levels. This suggests that different transcriptional response programs occur depending on cellular MYC concentrations. The authors propose that the dependence of MYC/MAX chromatin binding on interactions with proteins that are influenced by existing gene expression patterns contributes to specific gene regulation. They also show that the apparent affinity of promoters can explain the selective transcriptional response of genes to different MYC expression levels. The study provides insights into how MYC regulates genes at different cellular concentrations and how different mechanisms of MYC regulation occur at different levels of MYC expression.
This paper uses deep sequencing to investigate a tuberculosis outbreak in Nunavik, a region with high transmission rates. The authors find that deep sequencing can detect novel transmission events and super-spreading events that were missed by standard sequencing alone. They show that using a local reference genome can reduce errors and improve detection of epidemiologically informative variants. They identify a previously undetected super-spreading event in the outbreak where one source case transmitted to about a third of the cases between 2012 and 2012. They highlight the importance of deep sequencing for accurately identifying transmission in low diversity settings and detecting super-spreading, which can inform public health interventions. The paper also highlights limitations of deep sequencing, including potential errors introduced by culturing TB samples and inconsistencies in hSNP detection methods. The authors propose that deep sequencing can provide additional resolution of transmission events within short outbreaks, especially those with low strain diversity. They suggest that deep sequencing may be useful for TB control in regions with high transmission rates where low diversity is a defining feature.
The paper reports on a study of aging in the Turquoise killifish, a naturally short-lived vertebrate species. The authors found that Turquoise killifish have a complex gut microbiota with high bacterial diversity similar to that of mammals, but with Proteobacteria as the most abundant phylum. They analyzed the changes in gut microbiota during aging in Turquoise killifish and found that young fish have a more diverse gut microbiota, while old fish have a more pathogenic microbiota. They found that acute transfer of young gut microbiota to middle-age fish resulted in a life span increase and improved locomotor behavior. The authors propose that the young gut microbiota transfer resets the host microbiota towards a young-like community, which leads to a life span prolongation. They identified key bacterial genera associated with a young-like status and found that these bacteria are associated with carbohydrate metabolism, DNA repair and immune system function, which are important for longevity. Their results suggest that young gut microbiota transfer may be a novel life span enhancing intervention that could potentially be applied to other organisms, including mammals.
The paper discusses how voltage clamp recordings can be used to directly measure binding reactions to surface proteins like SERT, which was previously thought to be detectable only by measuring the displacement current. The Gouy-Chapman model predicts that binding a charged ligand to a surface protein results in a displacement current and an apparent change in capacitance. The authors tested this prediction using the human serotonin transporter SERT in HEK29 cells stably expressing GFP-tagged hSERT. They applied ligands like cocaine, desipramine, and ibogaine to the cells and observed a reduction in membrane capacitance, consistent with the model. They found that the change in capacitance was dependent on the voltage applied, but not the actual movement of charges within the membrane, and was consistent with the number of SERT molecules expressed. The change in capacitance was also seen in cells expressing SERT but not in control cells. This suggests that binding reactions to SERT result in a change in apparent membrane capacitance, which can be measured directly and is less susceptible to masking effects of conformational changes. The authors conclude that membrane capacitance measurements provide a useful tool to study ligand binding reactions in real time, beyond just measuring displacement currents.
The paper proposes a biophysical spiking neural network model that can reproduce the spontaneous activity and evoked responses observed in vivo. The model consists of a network of excitatory integrate-and-fire neurons with non-selective feedback inhibition and adaptive currents, and a supralinear inhibitory feedback. The network is able to generate intrinsic fluctuations and correlated responses to sensory stimuli through the interaction of excitation and adaptation currents. The authors find that inhibition is the primary mechanism that controls the strength of correlations between neurons, and that when inhibition is weak, the network exhibits a "asynchronous" state with tonic spiking and weak noise correlations. When inhibition is strong, the network becomes "desynchronized" and exhibits coordinated large-scale fluctuations, sharper tuning, and high selectivity. This is consistent with experimental observations that inhibition enhances sensory processing and reduces correlations between neurons. The model provides a simple and intuitive framework for understanding the mechanisms that control the coordinated dynamics in cortical networks with intrinsic variability, and demonstrates how the same mechanisms can control the dynamics of more complex functional models.
This paper investigated the genetic factors that influence human lifespan, or the length of life, using a combination of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), survival analysis and polygenic risk scores. They analyzed genetic data from over 1 million parents and found 12 genetic variants that influence lifespan, with effect sizes that were too small to be detected by standard GWAS. They used the kin-cohort method to analyze parental lifespans to increase power. They identified 7 genetic variants that were associated with lifespan, with effect sizes too small for standard GWAS but replicated by other studies. They found that these variants were more likely to be associated with diseases such as cardiovascular disease, autoimmune disease and smoking-related disease, but not with other types of cancer. The genetic variants associated with lifespan were enriched for pathways involved in lipoprotein metabolism and synaptic and dendritic function. The polygenic risk scores constructed from the genetic variants showed that individuals with higher scores had longer lifespans, with a median increase of 1-2 years. The study found that lifespan genetics were enriched for genes involved in lipid metabolism and transport, and that genetic variants associated with lifespan were more likely to be associated with diseases through pleiotropic effects. However, the study found that the variants and pathways identified did not underpin a general form of ageing that is independent of disease. The polygenic risk scores were associated with a reduced risk of mortality, but not a propensity for healthy aging. The study highlights the need for better legal and ethical frameworks for using genetic scores for lifespan prediction.
The paper describes how the authors used a phage display technique called PhIP-Seq to identify novel autoantigens in people with Autoimmune Polyendocrinopathy Syndrome type 1 (AIM1). PhIP-Seq is a broad-based approach that uses a phage display library of all human proteins and their isoforms to identify proteins targeted by autoantibodies in patient serum. The authors identified 69 novel autoantigens that were shared across at least 3 AIM1 samples, including 7 known autoantigens and 54 novel autoantigens. The novel autoantigens were found to be tissue-restricted, with the majority of them exhibiting tissue enrichment or group enrichment. The authors found that autoantibodies to KHDC3L were associated with ovarian insufficiency, which supports the idea that autoimmune responses target oocyte-specific proteins. They also identified an autoantibody signature associated with enteroendocrine cells in AIM1 that could be used for diagnosis. The study expanded the known autoantigen profile in AIM1 and identified a novel autoantigen associated with diarrheal-type intestinal dysfunction. The study highlights the potential of PhIP-Seq for identifying novel autoantigens and expanding our understanding of the autoimmune response in AIM1.
The paper describes how mutations in ribosomes can confer antibiotic resistance to Mycobacterium smegmatis. The mutations affect the assembly or stability of the large ribosomal subunit and cause a reprogramming of the transcriptome and proteome, leading to resistance to multiple antibiotics with different mechanisms of action. The mutations do not directly result in mistranslation, but they do impair ribosome assembly. The ribosomal mutations provide a temporary fitness cost in the absence of antibiotic stress, allowing the bacteria to acquire additional mutations that confer higher-level resistance. Even low levels of resistance in the ribosomal mutants are sufficient to confer a survival advantage, allowing them to survive and acquire additional mutations that confer high-level resistance. The ability of the mutations to revert to wild-type fitness upon passage in antibiotic-free conditions or after acquiring a second resistance-conferring mutation provides an evolutionary path to multidrug resistance. The findings suggest that ribosomal variants may serve as stepping-stones for the emergence of antibiotic-resistant populations, even though they have a fitness cost in the absence of antibiotic stress.
The paper discusses how the composition of the tumor microenvironment in cancer affects the metabolism of cancer cells. The authors measured the concentrations of various metabolites in the plasma and tumor interstitial fluid (TIF) of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumors and found that while some metabolites were depleted in TIF compared to plasma, others were enriched. They identified factors that influenced TIF composition, including tumor size, tissue of origin, diet, and genetic alterations. They found that TIF composition differed between tumors of different sizes and anatomical locations, and that tumors derived from different tissues had different TIF compositions. They also found that while cell-intrinsic factors like cancer cell-specific metabolic differences had an impact, factors like tumor genetics and anatomical location had more influence on TIF composition. The study suggests that the tumor microenvironment, including TIF, is distinct from the circulation and that changes in plasma metabolite levels can influence TIF composition. This provides insight into how the metabolism of cancer cells in the tumor microenvironment may impact tumor growth and drug sensitivity. The findings could be used to develop media that better approximates the nutrient levels available to cancer cells in tumors to identify metabolic liabilities that could ultimately lead to more effective therapies.
The paper discusses a new mortality forecasting approach that considers the impact of lifestyle factors such as smoking, obesity and alcohol on mortality trends. The approach distinguishes between the underlying long-term mortality decline that can be extrapolated into the future and the deviations caused by these lifestyle factors. It uses existing mortality trends to project mortality beyond the historical period. The approach is applied to 18 European countries to estimate life expectancy at birth in 205 and 206. The results show that the projection of mortality trends without lifestyle factors leads to higher life expectancy estimates than previous benchmark extrapolative methods, while incorporating lifestyle factors leads to more realistic projections of future life expectancy. The method considers the mortality experiences of other countries and assumes that the trends in non-lifestyle mortality will eventually converge to those of forerunner populations with higher life expectancy. The results indicate that life expectancy will increase, but at a slower pace than in the past, and that there will be larger gains for men than women. The approach is considered more robust, plausible and transparent compared to previous methods. The higher life expectancy estimates could have implications for population planning and pension schemes.
The paper presents evidence that a mutation in the pfk1 gene called pfk13 C58Y, which confers arteminin resistance, has persisted in Guyana, South America since 2010. This mutation was first identified in Guyana in 2010 and has since remained at a low prevalence, around 1.6%. The mutation is found on a single clonal lineage of parasites, which suggests that the parasite genetic background may play a role in its emergence and persistence. Gene editing studies on French Guianan parasites showed that the pfk13 C58Y mutation confers arteminin resistance in vitro at levels similar to Southeast Asian parasites. The mutation also negatively impacts parasite growth in vitro. The authors conclude that the low prevalence of the mutation in Guyana may be due to a fitness cost, as well as the lack of antimalarial drug usage and transmission levels. The persistence of this mutation suggests that Guyana has suspected artemin resistance and that the clinical and public health significance of the presence of these mutations on the therapeutic efficacy of artemisin-based therapies in the country should be evaluated.
This paper describes the generation and characterization of a mouse model of hypomyelination-cerebellar atrophy (H-ABC) caused by a specific TUBB4A mutation, the p.Asp29Asn (Tubb4D29N) mutation. The mutation was introduced using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing in mice, resulting in heterozygous and homozygous mutant animals. The mutation leads to progressive myelin loss in the brain and spinal cord, starting at early stages of development. Heterozygous mice exhibit tremors and gait abnormalities from around 9 months, while homozygous mice display symptoms from an early age. The homozygous mice have a more severe phenotype with progressive ataxia, dystonia, and impaired motor skills. Both heterozygous and homozygous mice show hypomyelination and degeneration of cerebellar granule cells and striatal neurons. Cortical neurons are also affected, with reduced survival and abnormal axonal morphology. The myelin sheaths in the optic nerve and spinal cord are thin. The mutation affects microtubule dynamics in neurons and oligodendrocytes, contributing to the observed myelin deficits. The study suggests that the TUBB4A mutation affects microtubule organization and transport, leading to impaired neuronal and oligodendrocyte development. The mouse model provides a tool to explore the molecular mechanisms of H-ABC and test potential therapeutic strategies.
This paper investigates how glucose levels impact the development of the heart during embryonic development. The authors found that glucose levels during late embryonic and early postnatal stages inhibit the maturation of cardiomyocytes, while only inducing cardiomyocyte proliferation during earlier stages. They found that glucose is metabolized through multiple pathways including glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway and hexosamine biosynthesis. The pro-mitotic and anti-maturation effect of glucose is regulated by glucose-derived deoxynucleotides through the pentose phosphate pathway. In vivo measurements showed that glucose uptake in fetal hearts decreases during late gestation and early postnatal stages, consistent with the in vitro findings. The authors propose that the glucose metabolic environment is a key regulator of cardiogenesis, with the glucose metabolic pathways serving as a nodal point balancing cell proliferation and differentiation. Understanding how the glucose metabolic signature of stem cells influences cardiomyocyte development could potentially lead to new methods for purifying or inducing cardiomyocyte maturation for regenerative medicine.
The paper describes a new root imaging platform called Growth and Luminescence Observatory for Roots (GLO-Roots) that allows root architecture and gene expression to be studied in soil-grown plants. GLO-Roots comprises custom growth vessels, luminescent reporters, and imaging systems. The system uses rhizotrons that enable plant growth in soil and root imaging. The system has been used to study root architecture, directionality, growth rate, gene expression and interactions with microbes in Arabidopsis and other plant species. The GLO-RIA software can automatically determine root system traits like area, depth, width, and directionality. The system also uses luciferase reporters to study gene expression in the root system. The system's ability to grow plants in soil allows for complex biotic interactions, like root-microbe associations, to be observed. The authors show that the system can be used to study root systems of different plant species and potentially identify genetic loci responsible for phenotypic variation in adult root phenotypes. The system provides a powerful tool for understanding how environmental stimuli affect root growth and function in a way that mimics natural conditions, allowing for a more holistic understanding of root biology.
The paper investigates the molecular mechanism of transcriptional memory, which is the phenomenon where a gene's transcription is faster or stronger after previous exposure to a stimulus. The authors study the case of the gene INO1 in yeast, which exhibits transcriptional memory after repression. They find that the transcription factor Sfl1 binds to a specific DNA sequence called the MRS and is necessary for the gene to remain associated with the nuclear pore complex after repression, leading to its transcriptional memory. The MRS sequence is also necessary for the gene to be dimethylated on histone H3K4, which in turn recruits the transcription factor Set3C. Set3C is essential for the gene's transcriptional memory. The authors propose that the binding of Cdk8+ Mediator, which is recruited during memory, plays a key role in promoting the poised form of the promoter that allows for faster transcriptional reactivation. The study identifies specific molecular requirements for the assembly of the poised promoter complex, including the transcription factor Sfl1, the nuclear pore protein Nup10, and the histone methyltransferase Set1. They also show that genes that exhibit salt-induced transcriptional memory have different regulators than INO1. The results suggest that the chromatin changes associated with transcriptional memory, such as dimethylation of H3K4, play a key role in the persistence and inheritance of memory.
The authors developed a rodent model of spasticity after bilateral pyramidotomy, which involves lesions of the corticospinal tracts in the pyramids. They found that bilateral pyramidotomy resulted in spasticity in the forelimbs, hindlimbs, and tail, as measured by increased reflexes, spasms, and abnormal locomotion during awake movements in the open field. They observed that the spasticity was accompanied by changes in neuronal properties in the spinal cord, including increased excitation of polysynaptic reflexes and reduced inhibition of low-threshold afferents. They then treated the rats with neurotrophin-3, a growth factor that enhances neural survival and function, to see if it could reduce spasticity. Intramuscular neurotrophin-3 treatment significantly reduced spasticity and improved motor behavior, as measured by the horizontal ladder test, grip strength, and von Frey test. The authors conclude that selective lesion of the corticospinal tracts is sufficient to cause spasticity and that neurotrophin-3 can be used as a potential therapy to treat the underlying neuronal component of disordered sensorimotor control resulting from upper motor neuron lesions.
The paper describes the results of an experiment aimed to identify the mechanisms by which neuronal protein NOVA regulates mRNA levels. The study found that NOVA regulates steady-state levels of mRNA transcripts through two main mechanisms: 1) by binding to 3' UTRs and stabilizing mRNA through direct interactions, and 2) by regulating alternative splicing events that introduce premature termination codons. The study identified 29 transcripts whose steady-state levels were NOVA-dependent and found that 15 of these contained cryptic exons predicted by the presence of premature termination codons. The study showed that NOVA-regulated transcripts were enriched in genes involved in synaptic function, transport and neuronal signaling. The paper suggests that NOVA regulates steady-state levels of mRNA through a combination of direct binding to 3' UTRs and indirect effects on alternative splicing that introduce premature termination codons. The findings provide insight into the mechanisms by which NOVA regulates gene expression in neurons and the role of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay in neuronal function and disease.
The paper investigates the role of Drosophila dorsophila DPM neurons in regulating sleep and memory consolidation. The authors find that DPM neurons are GABAergic and release GABA, which inhibits the activity of α/β' neurons in the mushroom bodies, leading to increased sleep. The inhibition is cell-autonomous and independent of any baseline activity. The inhibition is also observed when DPM activity is acutely induced, suggesting that DPMs are capable of promoting sleep during isolated experiences. The results suggest that DPMs are inhibitory rather than excitatory and are not directly involved in the positive feedback loop required for memory consolidation. The authors propose that DPMs may play a role in maintaining baseline sleep during periods of sensory deprivation and that their inhibition of α/β neurons during consolidation may help sharpen the transition of memory between different brain areas.
The paper describes a method called Multiplexed Chemical Map (MOHCA) Sequencing that uses hydroxyl radical footprinting and other methods to generate proximity maps of RNA bases. The authors used MOHCA-seq to detect proximal bases in RNA samples and then use these proximity information to guide Rosetta modeling to predict the 3D structure of RNA. They tested the method on a variety of RNAs with known structures and found that MOHCA-seq data improved the accuracy of the predictions. They demonstrated that MOHCA-seq data could be used to predict the global structures of RNAs without crystallographic structures, including complex RNAs like riboswitch aptamers. The MOHCA-seq data helped identify preformed tertiary structures that were not apparent in ligand-free RNAs. The method has the potential to rapidly test the effects of new RNA elements on RNA structure and could be used to guide structure-function studies of RNAs that adopt multiple conformations.
The paper describes the results of a study on how the protein AMPK regulates neuronal activity in response to starvation in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. The authors found that AMPK regulates two metabotropic glutamate receptors, GLR-1 and MGL-1, in the AIB and AIY interneurons to modulate their neuronal activity. The loss of AMPK signalling resulted in increased AIB neuronal activity and decreased AIY activity, leading to defective distal exploration in starved animals. The authors identified the specific AMPK phosphorylation targets GLR-1 and MGL-1 within the AIB and AIY interneurons and showed that AMPK regulates their abundance through direct phosphorylation of these receptors. The authors conclude that AMPK modulates synaptic activity in response to starvation through the simultaneous regulation of glutatergic inputs mediated by GLR-1 and MGL-1. The results demonstrate that AMPK plays a key role in regulating neuronal activity in response to energy stress and modulating the integration of sensory inputs from the AIB and AIY interneurons.
The paper discusses the results of analyzing the lag structure of resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) signals during wakefulness and slow wave sleep. The study found that during wakefulness, the brain shows apparent propagation of activity across different regions through functional networks, with well-ordered lag patterns. However, during slow wave sleep, the lag patterns become disorganized and the cross-network lag structure is altered. The study suggests that the disorganization of lag patterns during slow wave sleep may be related to the loss of integration across networks, which leads to reduced subjective awareness. The findings support theories that during slow wave sleep, neural communication is maintained within functional modules but disrupted across functional modules, resulting in "network segregation". The study argues that the observed lag patterns in the BOLD signal reflect neural communication at a broad spatio-temporal scale, and provide evidence that the brain's response to the environment is maintained during wakefulness while offline mechanisms concerned with synaptic homeostasis and memory consolidation are active during slow wave sleep. The study highlights the need for further investigation of the physiology of spontaneous activity in wakefulness and sleep using electrophysiology studies.
This paper investigates the neural mechanisms of schema retrieval, specifically the retrieval of rule-based schemas. Schemas are mental structures that help organize and integrate new information into existing knowledge. The authors designed an experiment to isolate the neural representations of different schema components, rule-based associations and low-level visual features of the task material. They found that rule-based associations were represented in the left anterior temporal lobe and prefrontal cortex, while low-level visual features were represented in the occipital cortex and anterior temporal lobe. Most importantly, both components converged in the left anterior temporal lobe after a 24-hour consolidation period, indicating that the left anterior temporal lobe plays a key role in integrating consolidated schema components during retrieval. This supports the idea that the anterior temporal lobe acts as a convergence zone that recombines information. The authors also found that new but related trial performance during a transfer test was solved by applying the schemas, providing evidence that their material provided a mental framework for subjects to assimilate new information.
This paper investigates the early events of lymph node metastasis by melanoma cells. The researchers found that melanoma cells that have high levels of sialylation on their surface can directly interact with Siglec1 expressing lymphatic endothelial cells in the lymph node sinus, providing an adherent "soil" for the cells to colonize. This interaction between melanoma cells and Siglec1 expressing macrophages facilitates the growth and survival of pioneer metastatic cells, allowing them to overcome dormancy and initiate successful lymph node colonization. The researchers showed that Siglec1 expression on lymphatic endothelial cells in the lymph node sinus is necessary for the survival and proliferation of early metastatic cells, which in turn enables them to form metastatic foci in the lymph node. The reduction of sialylation in melanoma cells reduced their ability to metastasize to the lymph nodes, suggesting that hypersialation may be a vulnerability that could be targeted therapeutically to prevent lymph node metastasis. Overall, the results provide a model for the early events of lymph node metastasis by melanoma cells and suggest that targeting the Siglec1-macrophage interaction may be a potential strategy for preventing lymph node metastasis and subsequent spread to distal organs.
This paper investigates the role of corticothal feedback in shaping retinal wave transmission and the development of spindle oscillations in the neonatal rat. The authors find that during the period of retinal waves, corticothal feedback from the cortex amplifies and prolongs spontaneous activity in the thalamus and is necessary for the propagation of spindle-oscillations in the thalamus and cortex. However, after the period of retinal waves, corticothal feedback becomes inhibitory and is not necessary for the generation of spindle oscillations in the cortex. They demonstrate that during the first postnatal week, corticothal feedback amplifies and prolongs spontaneous activity, while after the second postnatal week corticothal feedback synchronizes spindle oscillations. The corticothal feedback is shown to be required for the generation of spindle oscillations but not early gamma oscillations. The results provide evidence for a developmental role for the late development of inhibition, where corticothal feedback initially amplifies retinal waves and then becomes inhibitory. The mechanism for corticothal inhibition likely involves the recruitment of reticular thalamus interneurons, which are poorly driven by ventral cortical inputs. The results provide insights into how transient circuits refine during development and may have implications for circuit formation and seizure susceptibility.
This paper studies the mechanism by which the egg activation event controls protein translation during the oocyte-to-embryo transition in Drosophila. The authors find that the CDK1 protein phosphorylates the protein GNU, which prevents its interaction with the PNG-PLU sub-complex and activates the PNG kinase. This inhibits PNG activity. When GNU is dephosphorylated after egg activation, it activates PNG kinase and leads to translation of mRNAs. This dephosphorylation of GNU after egg activation limits the activity of PNG kinase to the narrow window of the oocyte-to-embryo transition. The mechanism provides a precise link between meiotic progression and translational control.
This paper investigates the effect of single-neuron synaptic plasticity-dependent plasticity (STDP) on the subthreshold responses of visual cortical neurons in the visual cortex of anesthetized rats. The authors used two-photon microscopy and whole-cell patch-clamp recording to measure the subthreshold responses of neurons in response to visual stimuli and pairing an artificial action potentials (APs) to induce STDP. They found that STDP can convert neurons that do not spike to visual stimuli into spiking neurons, and increase or decrease existing spiking responses. The induced changes in subthreshold responses were observed to be spatially organized, with the paired position showing the largest changes. The authors built a model to simulate the STDP effect on the neuron's subthreshold responses and found that introducing input jitter into the model reproduced the observed broadening of the peak and changes in the subthreshold response. The results suggest that small voltage changes induced by STDP have a dramatic effect on spiking output and may be a fundamental mechanism for neurons joining or leaving cell assemblies.
The paper discusses how intrinsic disorder within the anchoring protein AKAP79 contributes to the regulation of protein phosphatase 2B (PP2B) activity. The authors investigate the conformational flexibility of AKAP79-PP2B complexes using negative-stain electron microscopy and chemical cross-linking experiments. They find that dormant AKAP79-PP2B complexes exist in a variety of extended conformations, while active AKAP79-PP2B/CaM complexes are more uniform. They identify a linear motif in AKAP79 that contacts the B subunit of PP2B, the L-X-I-P motif, which serves to fine-tune the calcium sensitivity of anchored and active PP2B. They also show that this motif interacts with the immunosuppressant drug cyclosporin A, suggesting that it may be involved in regulating the clinical action of immunosuppressant drugs. The study provides a mechanistic perspective on how AKAP79 assemblies influence calcium signaling and how protein-protein interactions contribute to the specificity of anchored enzymes. The findings suggest that combinatorial recruitment of binding partners tailors the overall conformation of the macromolecular assembly, providing a mechanism to shape AKAP79/150 kinase-phosphatase assemblies for their customized physiological roles.
This paper investigates how primary whisker neurons in awake mice encode sensory information. The authors recorded the activity of single primary whisker neurons and simultaneously measured whisker kinematics and mechanics during mice exploring an object with its whiskers. They found that whisker curvature, not angle, is the best predictor of spiking during active sensation. The curvature of the whisker is correlated with the bending moment acting on the whisker, which is proportional to the whisker's angular acceleration. The authors found that whisker angle predicts spikes poorly, suggesting that whisker angle can change without modulating mechanotransduction in the follicle. They found that whisker curvature sensitivity is a general phenomenon and can account for primary neuron responses both during active touch and passive stimulation. The results provide a mechanical basis for linking receptor mechanisms to behavior and highlight the importance of studying neurons under natural, active sensing conditions.
The paper describes how phosphorylation of the myosin heavy chain Myo1 regulates its activity and function by modulating the conformation of its lever arm. Phosphorylation of the Myo1 neck region at position 72 changes the conformation of the lever arm and allows the light chain to bind to the IQ motif at position 1, which is calcium-regulated. When calcium levels are low, Myo1 associates with two molecules of the calcium-regulated calmodulin light chain Cam1. Phosphorylation of Myo1 at position 72 changes the conformation of the Cam1-associated lever arm, allowing the light chain to bind to the IQ2 motif and regulate endocytosis and polarized growth. Upon starvation, there is an increase in Myo1 serine 72 phosphorylation, which switches light chain preference to favor the recruitment of a single molecule of the calcium-insensitive calmodulin-like Cam2. The conformation and rigidity of the Myo1 lever arm therefore play a key role in modulating the tension sensing properties of the motor domain, allowing Myo1 to regulate the rate of endocytosis according to cell cycle stage and needs. Phosphorylation-dependent changes in the calcium-regulated conformation and rigidity of the Myo1 lever provide a simple mechanism for regulating the diverse cytoplasmic activities of myosin motors within all cells.
This paper presents a high-resolution optical tweezers study of the XPD helicase, a 5'–3' translocating SF2B enzyme that unwinds duplex DNA. The study reveals that XPD unwinds in 1-base pair steps, but is an inefficient helicase with frequent backstepping. The backstepping behavior is found to be correlated with the position along the hairpin where the minimum hairpin opening probability is reached. A minimal kinetic model is proposed that captures the stepping dynamics and provides a mechanism for the observed behavior. The model suggests that the XPD helicase unwinds by capturing spontaneously opened base pairs at the ssDNA/dsDNA junction, while the larger 5-base backsteps likely involve rearrangements of the nucleoprotein complex. The study demonstrates the importance of the secondary binding site in controlling XPD activity and provides insights into the mechanism of the inefficient unwinding. The findings make XPD suitable for its role in nucleotide excision repair and transcription.
The paper discusses the mechanism of single base pair unwinding by the hexameric helicase G40P. Using single-molecule FRET experiments, the authors found that G40P unwinds DNA in one base pair steps, with each ATP hydrolysis step moving the helicase forward one base pair. However, the presence of GC base pairs slows down unwinding. The authors propose a model where after ADP is released from one subunit, the DNA-binding loop reduces affinity, allowing the helicase to move forward one base pair. If the next base is an AT base, it melts, and the helicase steps forward. If the next base is a GC base, the melting step is slower, preventing the helicase from moving forward. The helicase can then slip backwards and rezip the DNA until a new DNA-binding loop is established. The presence of DnaG, which binds to single-stranded DNA, hinders G40P slippage and promotes unwinding. The model is consistent with the observed ATP hydrolysis coordination between subunits, sequential nucleotide hydrolysis, and the exclusion model of unwinding.
This paper describes the first structure of a substrate-bound phosphatidylinositol-kinase-related kinase (PIK) active site, specifically the SMG1-8-9 complex that phosphorylates the UPF1 protein. The authors used cryo-electron microscopy and mass spectrometry to study the interaction between the complex and identify the molecular basis for how SMG1 recognizes specific phosphorylation sites in its substrate. They found that a glutamine residue at position +1 in the substrate is the minimal requirement for SMG1 phosphorylation, and that a Leu residue at position -1 in the substrate is optimal for the interaction with SMG1. They also found that a hydrophobic residue at position -1 is important for phosphorylation efficiency. The results provide molecular insights into the mechanism of phosphoacceptor recognition and suggest a specific mechanism for pseudosubstrate function by the PRD of SMG1. The findings can be extrapolated to other PIKs, such as ATM and ATR, and explain the specificity for Ser-containing substrates with a glutamine downstream residue at position +1 and an upstream hydrophobic residue at position -1. The results also elucidate the mechanism of phosphorylation site selection by SMG1 and other PIK family members, which is important for understanding the NMD pathway. The authors conclude that the structure of the SMG1-8-9 complex provides a rationale for the specificity of phosphorylation sites among different PIKs.
The paper describes a study that investigates how pigment cell interactions during zebrafish pigment pattern formation are translated into species differences. The authors identify a novel mode of long-distance cellular communication through airinemes, which are projections extended by cells of the xanthophore lineage. Airinemes are found to contact melanophores within the prospective stripe regions and promote Notch signaling and melanophore rearrangement during stripe consolidation. The authors show that airineme production is differentiation-state dependent and that loss of long-distance airineme signaling is associated with evolutionary changes in factors extrinsic to the xanthophore lineage, specifically Csf1. This leads to precocious differentiation of xanthophores and reduced melanophore patterning in the pearl danio species. The study provides insights into how evolutionary changes in gene activity can be translated into morphogenetic behaviors and highlights the complexity of cellular mechanisms of airineme production and targeting.
The paper describes a new mechanism of ligand-induced receptor activation for the discoidin domain receptor domain tyrosine kinases (DDR1) that is distinct from the traditional dimerization mechanism observed for other receptor tyrosine kinases. DDR1 forms constitutive dimers in the absence of ligand binding but lacks a transmembrane helix interaction, and ligand binding induces clustering of DDR1 molecules. Collagen binding leads to lateral association of DDR1 dimers, which in turn induces phosphorylation between neighboring DDR1 molecules. This phosphorylation occurs in trans between dimers and not within a single dimer, and does not require identical cytoplasmic regions. The receiver kinase activity of the donor kinase. The transmembrane domain interactions are required for phosphorylation between dimers. The receiver kinase acts as a substrate for the donor kinase, which functions as an enzyme kinase in the co-expression experiments. The authors conclude that ligand-induced clustering is the key mechanism of DDR1 activation, which may involve both direct receptor-receptor contacts and another membrane protein. The findings have implications for the function of DDR1 in cancer, where constitutive dimers may contribute to DDR1 signaling, while ligand-induced clustering may contribute to DDR1 activation in response to ligand binding.
The paper explores the role of the P. sojae effector PsAvh52 in promoting P. sojae infection. PsAvh52 binds to the soybean acetyltransferase GmTAP1, causing it to relocate from the cytoplasm into nuclear speckles, where it can increase histone acetylation levels and promote plant susceptibility to P. sojae. GmTAP1 relocation requires the N-terminal domain of PsAvh52. The study shows that PsAvh52 causes GmTAP1 to relocate into nuclear speckles, which is associated with increased histone acetylation and susceptibility to P. sojae. The results suggest that PsAvh52 recruits GmTAP1 to promote plant susceptibility through epigenetic modifications. The findings add to the emerging theme of plant pathogen manipulation of host epigenetic modifications to promote infection.
This paper presents a new method for preparing and imaging recombinant primate TRIM5 proteins and hyperstable HIV-1 capsids. The authors developed a baculovirus expression system to produce recombinant TRIM5 proteins in insect cells. They developed a new purification method that involves crosslinking the core proteins to cyclosporin A to stabilize the viral capsid and improve purity. They also generated hyperstable HIV-1 capsids by disulfide-crosslinking the capsid proteins, which could be used to study the binding of TRIM5 proteins to the capsid surface. They imaged TRIM5 proteins on hyperstable HIV-1 cores using electron cryotomography and found that TRIM5 proteins form hexagonal nets on the surface of the capsid. They demonstrated that TRIM5 proteins can bind directly to hyperstable HIV-1 cores and restrict HIV-1 transduction. The results indicate that TRIM5 proteins form flexible hexagonal nets on the capsid surface with their domain positions schematically shown in Figure 7D.
This paper describes the crystal structure of the human synaptonemal complex protein SYCP3, which is essential for meiosis in sexually reproducing organisms. The structure consists of a tetrameric rod-like protein with alternating helical chains that are held together by hydrophobic and polar interactions. The N-terminal regions of the protein interact with double-stranded DNA, while the C-terminal regions interact with the chromosome axis. The tetrameric structure allows the protein to tether distant locations on the chromosome, pinching off short sections of DNA and bridging them through self-assembly of additional SYCP3 molecules. This organization of chromosomal DNA helps to compact the chromosome axis and prevent strains that build during recombination and crossing over. The paper proposes that SYCP3 assembly on the chromosome axis is initiated by interactions of individual tetramers with the DNA and cooperative loading of further SYCP3 molecules onto DNA, leading to a three-dimensional lattice that organizes the chromosome axis. The study provides a molecular basis for the organization of chromosomes during meiosis and suggests that SYCP3 plays a key role in compaction and organization of the chromosome axis.
The paper investigates the role of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EFR) signaling in the Drosophila ovary stem cells called Foldicle Stem Cells (FSCs) during the process of stem cell maintenance and differentiation. EFR signaling is found to be required specifically in the FSCs to establish cell polarity throughout the FSC lineage. The study shows that EFR signaling is required for FSC maintenance in the niche and promotes the formation of basal and lateral domains, while suppressing the apical domain. EFR signaling also regulates the segregation of stem and daughter cell fates in the FSC lineage, specifically by maintaining the apical domains of FSCs. Loss of EFR signaling causes FSCs to lose their basal and lateral identities, leading to loss of cell polarity and rapid loss from the niche. The study suggests that EFR signaling promotes the stem fate in part by specifying the unique polarity of the stem cell, which is an essential part of the program that promotes the segregation of FSC and daughter cell fates. EFR signaling is known to promote a stem-like or less differentiated state in other epithelial tissues, but the specific effects of EFR signaling in the stem cells of these tissues are not well understood. The results demonstrate that EFR signaling promotes the stem fate at least in part by specifying the unique polarity of the stem.
The paper explores the role of RNA binding in regulating the function of the protein WDR5, a multifunctional protein that interacts with multiple subunits of the MLL complex involved in histone methylation. The authors used mutagenesis to identify a specific binding site for the RNA HOTTIP on WDR5 and found that WDR5 binds to over 140 endogenous RNAs. They found that WDR5 binding is required for WDR5 protein stability and maintenance of global histone H3K4 methylation levels, and that loss of RNA binding leads to rapid degradation of WDR5 protein. This suggests that RNA binding plays a direct role in regulating protein turnover and transmission of epigenetic information. The authors also showed that WDR5 binding to RNAs extends the protein's half-life by 24 hours, which is comparable to a cell cycle duration. The results suggest that RNA binding may regulate protein turnover and transmission of epigenetic information in addition to recruiting protein complexes to genomic loci. This study highlights the importance of RNA binding in regulating the multigenerational transmission of epigenetic proteins required for cell state maintenance.
The paper investigates whether transposable elements (TEs) are reactivated in natural hybrid lineages of the yeast species Saccharomyces paradoxus. The authors analyzed genome sequences from 207 wild isolates of S. paradoxus and found that natural hybrid lineages exhibit no evidence of TE reactivation, despite some hybrid lineages exhibiting relatively high TE copy numbers and dynamics consistent with recent TE expansions. The authors suggest that factors like population structure and environmental pressures do not explain the lack of reactivation in hybrids, instead pointing to deterministic factors like transposition rates that are influenced by host genetic compatibility and transposition regulation. They performed experiments to investigate the relationship between evolutionary divergence and transposition rates in artificial hybrids of closely related and divergent genotypes, finding that hybrids between more divergent genotypes exhibit no deregulation of TEs. The study suggests that natural hybrids are limited in their ability to uncover the interplay between hybridization and transposition, as they are relatively recent introgressed lineages, and that environmental factors are unlikely to explain TE dynamics in natural lineages. The results provide insights into the role of TE reactivation in speciation, highlighting the importance of host-encoded factors in determining TE dynamics in hybrids.
The paper investigates the mechanism by which the limb bud develops its spatially specific expression of the Shh gene during embryonic development. The Shh gene is initially expressed in a narrow strip along the posterior margin of the limb bud, called the zone of polarizing activity (ZPA). The ZRS, a long-range enhancer controlling the Shh expression, is found to be poised throughout the posterior mesenchyme of the limb bud, but only expresses Shh in the ZPA. The ZRS retains features of a poised enhancer, with H3K4me1 and H3K27ac enrichment. The paper shows that FGF signaling plays a key role in priming the ZRS, while GABPα/ETV4/ETV5 antagonistic factors regulate Shh expression. When FGF signaling is inhibited, the ZRS becomes closed, leading to loss of H3K4me1 enrichment and Shh expression. GABPα binds to the ZRS and recruits HAT p30, leading to increased H3K27ac and Shh expression. TSA treatment of limb-derived cells activates the ZRS, restoring H3K4me1 enrichment. ETV4 and HDAC2 bind the ZRS, repressing Shh expression outside the ZPA. The findings reveal a two-step mechanism for Shh activation, with priming in the distal mesenchyme followed by activation in the posterior region containing the ZPA. The study demonstrates that the ZRS exists in two states, poised and active, and that the balance between activators and repressors is required for proper Shh expression during limb development.
The paper describes Hippocampome.org, a web portal that aims to provide a comprehensive knowledge base of the hippocampal formation, a mammalian cortical region. The authors describe how they constructed the portal by selecting a set of discriminative features from published information about hippocampal neuron types, including axonal and dendritic morphology, neurotransmitter identity, and electrophysiological properties. They then link this information to existing knowledge about each neuron type, browseable through summaries of morphology, molecular expression, electrophysiology, and connectivity. The portal allows researchers to easily find information about specific neuron types and identify relationships between them. The authors argue that the portal will accelerate discovery by consolidating available knowledge and providing a standard for what information should be included in publications describing hippocampal neuron types.
