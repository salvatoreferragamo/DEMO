This provides evidence for the sufficiency of feedback signals in learning movement sequences and suggests a role for the cerebellum in chaining together movement components to produce a sequence of movements. These findings have implications for understanding how the cerebellum contributes to motor learning and coordination.

elife-10806-v2	[L] This paper explores the relationship between our perception of numbers and space. The authors investigate a phenomenon called motion direction-numerosity cross-adaptation, where visual motion direction affects our perception of number. They show that motion to the left adapts small numbers, leading to overestimation of numerosity, while motion to the right adapts large numbers, resulting in underestimation. The study also demonstrates that this cross-adaptation effect occurs in a spatiotopic reference frame, indicating that the processing of numerosity and motion direction occurs in the parietal cortex. These findings suggest that our perception of numbers is influenced by spatial processing in the brain.[E] This paper presents a study investigating the interaction between numerosity processing and visual motion direction. The authors demonstrate a phenomenon called motion direction-numerosity cross-adaptation, where motion in one direction affects the perception of numbers. Specifically, they show that leftward motion adapts small numbers, leading to overestimation, while rightward motion adapts large numbers, resulting in underestimation. Additionally, they find that this cross-adaptation effect occurs in a spatiotopic reference frame and is likely to be mediated by neurons in the parietal cortex. These results suggest that the neural circuits involved in numerosity processing retain sensitivity to spatial features and support the idea of cortical recycling, where circuits originally involved in spatial processing are repurposed for numerical computations.

The researchers found that syt 7 acts as a calcium sensor and interacts with another protein called calmodulin (CaM) to control the replenishment of synaptic vesicles, which are the packets of neurotransmitters. They discovered that when syt 7 is missing or not functioning properly, there is a reduction in synaptic vesicle replenishment, leading to impairments in short-term synaptic plasticity. This finding helps to expand our understanding of the mechanisms involved in communication between neurons and how disruptions in these mechanisms can contribute to neurological disorders.[E] This study focuses on the role of synaptotagmin 7 (syt 7) in regulating the process of synaptic vesicle replenishment, which is crucial for maintaining proper neurotransmitter release and short-term synaptic plasticity. The researchers found that syt 7 functions as a calcium sensor for vesicle replenishment and forms a specific interaction with calmodulin (CaM). Loss of syt 7 or disruption of the syt 7-CaM interaction led to impaired replenishment of synaptic vesicles, resulting in reduced neurotransmitter release and alterations in short-term synaptic plasticity. The study also reveals that there are both calcium-dependent and calcium-independent pathways for vesicle replenishment, with syt 7 acting as the calcium sensor in the former pathway. These findings provide valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying synaptic transmission and plasticity, and have important implications for understanding neurological disorders involving synaptic dysfunction.

elife-01273-v1	[L] This paper discusses the adaptive strategies that individuals with unilateral hand absence use to compensate for the loss of their hand. The authors study both congenital and acquired hand absence and investigate how the brain adapts to these challenges. They found that individuals who rely more on their residual arm activate the missing hand cortex during movements of the residual arm, while those who are more dependent on their intact hand activate the deprived cortex during intact hand movements. These findings suggest that the brain can adapt to the loss of a limb and use other body parts to compensate for the loss.[E] This paper investigates the adaptive plasticity in the human brain in response to unilateral hand absence. The authors study individuals with congenital and acquired hand absence and examine how their daily limb usage strategies influence cortical reorganization. They use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to assess upper limb use patterns and cortical reorganization in these individuals. They find that the degree of limb use is reflected in the activity patterns in the deprived cortex, with individuals who rely more on their intact hand showing increased activation during intact hand movements, and those who use their residual arm more frequently showing increased activation during residual arm movements. These results highlight the adaptive nature of the human brain and have implications for neurorehabilitation strategies.

elife-30789-v2	[L] This study focuses on the mechanisms that regulate the formation of crossovers during meiosis, the process by which cells divide to produce gametes. The researchers investigated a group of proteins called ZHP, which are involved in the formation of crossovers. They found that these proteins interact with each other to form two complexes that regulate crossover formation. Additionally, the ZHP proteins are also involved in chromosome remodeling, a process that allows for the separation of chromosomes during cell division. These findings provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms that govern meiosis and may have implications for understanding genetic inheritance and infertility.[E] Meiosis is a critical process in sexual reproduction, as it generates gametes with half the number of chromosomes found in normal cells. To ensure proper chromosome segregation during meiosis, crossovers between homologous chromosomes must be formed. This study explores the role of the ZHP protein family in the regulation of crossover formation and chromosome remodeling during meiosis in C. elegans. The researchers demonstrate that the ZHP proteins form two heterodimeric complexes, ZHP-1/2 and ZHP-3/4, which act together to control crossover formation. These proteins exhibit distinct localization patterns and are required for the proper distribution of other meiotic factors, such as COSA-1 and RAD-51, at crossover sites. Furthermore, the ZHP proteins play a crucial role in mediating chromosome remodeling, a process that enables the proper separation of homologous chromosomes during meiotic division. Overall, this study provides important insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying meiotic recombination and chromosome segregation.
elife-59885-v3	[L] This study investigated the processes that occur during mitotic exit, which is the final phase of the cell cycle. The researchers found that while protein destruction is important for initiating mitotic exit, it is the activity of phosphatases (enzymes that remove phosphate groups from proteins) that determines the order of events during this phase. Specifically, they found that two types of phosphatases, PP1 and PP2A-B55, play crucial roles in dephosphorylating proteins in a specific order to ensure the successful completion of mitotic exit. The study also revealed that protein synthesis is not required for normal cellular function during mitosis and anaphase, contrary to previous beliefs.[E] This study focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms that govern mitotic exit, the final stage of the cell cycle. The researchers discovered that while protein destruction through the action of the APC/C complex is necessary to initiate mitotic exit, it is the coordinated activity of phosphatases, specifically PP1 and PP2A-B55, that determine the precise order of events during this phase. They found that different phosphatases have distinct preferences for specific phosphorylation sites, and this preference dictates the rate at which proteins are dephosphorylated. The study also provided evidence that protein synthesis is not essential for mitotic exit, contradicting previous findings. Overall, these findings shed light on the intricacies of the molecular processes underlying mitotic exit and highlight the central role of phosphatases in orchestrating these events.

The researchers used mice to show that deletion of Wfs1 in certain brain cells resulted in enhanced depressive behaviors in response to stress. They also found that Wfs1 is expressed specifically in layer 2/3 pyramidal cells in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), and the loss of Wfs1 in these neurons led to hyperactivation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, a system involved in the stress response. These findings suggest that dysfunction of Wfs1 in the PFC may contribute to MDD by altering the response to stress.[E] This study investigates the role of Wfs1 in MDD. The authors demonstrate that loss of Wfs1 in layer 2/3 pyramidal cells in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) leads to enhanced depressive behaviors in response to stress. They also show that this loss results in hyperactivation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The researchers suggest that dysfunctional Wfs1 in the PFC may contribute to the development of MDD through alterations in stress responsiveness. They also identify potential downstream targets of Wfs1 in the PFC, such as WNT7A and NTF3, which may play a role in the regulation of depressive behaviors. Overall, this study provides important insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying MDD and highlights the role of the PFC in the modulation of stress-induced depressive behaviors.

However, they also find distinct differences in the kinetics of conformational changes induced by each modulation. These findings highlight the importance of Hsp90's conformational dynamics in regulating its function.

These findings contribute to our understanding of the complex mechanisms that control appetite and could have implications for the development of new therapies for obesity and eating disorders.[E] This study aimed to investigate the role of ghrelin signaling in the ventral hippocampus (vHP) and its downstream targets in the regulation of conditioned feeding behavior. The researchers found that pharmacological blockade of the ghrelin receptor in the vHP reduced chow intake during a meal-entrainment schedule in rats. They also determined that ghrelin-activated neurons in the vHP projected directly to the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) and specifically targeted orexin-expressing neurons in the dorsal perifornical LHA region. Unilateral lesions of the LHA abolished vHP ghrelin-induced hyperphagia, suggesting that the vHP to LHA pathway is necessary for this feeding response. Furthermore, they found that this effect was mediated by orexin receptor signaling, as blockade of orexin receptor type 1 in the lateral ventricle attenuated the hyperphagic response to vHP ghrelin administration. These findings demonstrate the involvement of a specific neural circuitry in the regulation of conditioned feeding behavior and add to our understanding of the complex mechanisms underlying appetite control.

Overall, this study highlights the importance of proper regulation of MT growth for T cell polarization and reveals the role of KIF21B in this process.[E] This paper investigates the impact of KIF21B, a kinesin-4 family member, on the organization and dynamics of microtubules (MTs) in T cells during the formation of the immunological synapse. The researchers generated KIF21B knockout Jurkat T cell lines and demonstrated that these cells had defects in centrosome translocation towards the synapse and formation of the immunological synapse. They then used live-cell imaging to show that KIF21B-GFP walked along MTs and induced pauses and depolymerization at the MT plus ends. By using computational modeling, the authors showed that the overgrowth of MTs in T cells lacking KIF21B hindered centrosome polarization. Furthermore, they showed that inhibiting MT growth with vinblastine rescued centrosome polarization in KIF21B knockout cells. These findings suggest that proper regulation of MT growth, facilitated by KIF21B, is critical for T cell polarization and the formation of the immunological synapse.
elife-46418-v2	[L] This study investigates the impact of sexual interactions on the lifespan of hermaphroditic nematodes, specifically Caenorhabditis elegans and Caenorhabditis briggsae. The researchers find that brief encounters with males do not shorten the lifespan of young hermaphrodites, but do shorten the lifespan of middle-aged hermaphrodites. They discover that the presence of self-sperm in young hermaphrodites protects them from the negative effects of mating with males. This protective effect is not due to the age of the hermaphrodites, but rather the presence of self-sperm that act through a sperm-sensing pathway. The protective effect of self-sperm is conserved in other hermaphroditic nematodes and may be important for their reproductive success.[E] This paper investigates the impact of sexual interactions on the lifespan of hermaphroditic nematodes, particularly C. elegans and C. briggsae. The researchers find that short encounters with males do not significantly affect the lifespan of young hermaphrodites, but do shorten the lifespan of middle-aged hermaphrodites. They demonstrate that the presence of self-sperm in young hermaphrodites protects them from the detrimental effects of mating with males. This protective effect is not solely due to the youthfulness of the hermaphrodites, but rather the presence of self-sperm that activate a sperm-sensing pathway. The researchers also show that this protective effect of self-sperm is conserved in other hermaphroditic nematodes, suggesting it may be an important adaptation for their reproductive success.

elife-56383-v2	[L] This study focused on understanding how germ cells, which are important for the development and maintenance of tissues, leave their stem cell niche to differentiate. The researchers used live imaging techniques and genome editing to study the interactions between germ cells, the distal tip cell (DTC) niche, and a neighboring somatic cell called Sh1 in the reproductive system of the roundworm C. elegans. They discovered that Sh1 cells extend thin membranous projections that intercalate among germ cells and the processes of the DTC, contradicting the previous understanding that there is a germ cell bare region. They also found that germ cells divide at the interface between the DTC and Sh1 cells in a polarized manner, with one daughter cell remaining near the DTC and the other moving closer to Sh1.

Furthermore, they found that germ cells divide in a polarized manner at the interface between the DTC and Sh1, with one daughter cell remaining anchored near the DTC and the other becoming enwrapped by Sh1. The researchers propose that this polarized division and the subsequent growth of Sh1 over the dividing cells allow germ cells to exit the niche and differentiate. The actin cytoskeleton was found to be important for the growth of Sh1 over the dividing cells. Overall, this study adds to our understanding of the complex interactions between stem cells, their niche, and neighboring somatic cells in regulating cell fate decisions.

elife-04539-v2	[L] This study investigates the process of DNA replication and repair in eukaryotic cells. The researchers focused on a specific region of DNA called RTS1 that often causes problems during replication. They found that when replication is hindered at RTS1, a protein called Rad52 is recruited to the site within minutes to initiate DNA repair. They also discovered that the repaired forks are prone to collapsing and undergoing multiple rounds of recombination. The researchers suggest that this process helps to complete DNA replication in a timely manner, but it can also lead to genetic changes that contribute to diseases such as cancer.[E] The researchers investigated the process of DNA replication and repair when hindered at a specific region of DNA called RTS1. They found that Rad52 is recruited to RTS1 within minutes of replication fork blockage, initiating DNA repair.

The researchers propose that this recombination-dependent replication (RDR) process helps to complete DNA replication, but it can also lead to genetic changes and increased recombination at the site. They found that RDR is not required for cell viability and that fork convergence prevents or curtails the recombination process.

elife-18020-v2	[L]This study explored the role of a protein called p21 in the replication of DNA (the genetic material) in cells. The researchers found that p21 helps to regulate the DNA replication process by preventing the recruitment of a specific enzyme called Pol κ to the replication sites. When p21 is absent or at low levels, Pol κ is able to interfere with DNA replication, leading to replication errors and genomic instability. The findings suggest that p21 is an important protein for maintaining the stability of the DNA replication process in cells.[E]The protein p21, also known as p21CDKN1A, is a member of a protein family called cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs) that regulate cell cycle progression. While p21 is well-known for its role in cell cycle arrest after DNA damage, this study revealed a novel function for p21 in DNA replication. The researchers found that p21 prevents the recruitment of a specific DNA polymerase, Pol κ, to the replication forks, thereby ensuring the accurate and efficient replication of DNA.

elife-14730-v3	[L] This paper investigates the role of a gene called MAGI3 in breast cancer. The researchers found that MAGI3 is frequently altered in breast cancer through a mechanism called premature cleavage and polyadenylation (pPA), which results in the production of a truncated form of the MAGI3 protein.

elife-00311-v1	[L] This paper describes a new method for studying the dynamics of proteins by analyzing X-ray diffraction data.

elife-66609-v2	[L] This study investigated how the brain regulates the release of antidiuretic hormone (AVP) in response to water and food intake. The researchers identified two separate neural circuits involved in this regulation. One circuit, located in the hypothalamus, is responsible for water-related regulation, while the other circuit, located in the arcuate nucleus, is responsible for food-related regulation. They found that different populations of neurons in these circuits respond differently to water and food cues, with water causing a decrease in AVP release and food causing an increase. These findings provide a better understanding of the complex mechanisms underlying the body's homeostatic control of water and food intake.[E] This paper investigates the neural circuits involved in the presystemic regulation of AVP release in response to water and food intake. The authors used a combination of retrograde rabies mapping, in vivo calcium imaging, optogenetics, and chemogenetics to identify and characterize the specific neural circuits mediating the presystemic regulation of AVP neuron activity. They found that two separate circuits are involved in water-related and food-related regulation of AVP release. The water-related circuit is comprised of neurons in the lamina terminalis that provide direct input to AVP neurons in the hypothalamus. In contrast, the food-related circuit involves neurons in the arcuate nucleus. These findings provide insights into the neural mechanisms involved in the regulation of AVP release and contribute to our understanding of homeostatic control of water and food intake.

elife-70317-v1	[L] This paper explores how Drosophila larvae learn to associate the presence of carbon dioxide (CO2) with a reward. The researchers developed a Y-maze assay to measure the larvae's preferences and found that after training, the larvae switched from avoiding CO2 to being indifferent to its presence. They also discovered that the timing and context of reward presentation influenced the larvae's learning.

elife-32963-v1	[L] This paper discusses the mechanism by which transcription factors (TFs) bind to specific sequences on DNA. The authors analyze the structures of TFs bound to DNA and identify three mechanisms of recognition: direct readout, indirect readout, and water-mediated interactions. They find that TFs can bind with high affinity to multiple different sequences, and this is due to a trade-off between enthalpy and entropy. The authors provide evidence from structural analysis, thermodynamic measurements, and mutational studies to support their findings. They conclude that the ability of TFs to bind to multiple sequences with similar affinity is a common phenomenon that is driven by the balance between enthalpy and entropy.[E]This paper investigates the molecular mechanism underlying the ability of transcription factors (TFs) to bind to multiple distinct DNA sequences with high affinity. The authors focus on two homeodomain proteins, HOXB13 and CDX2, which recognize two different optimal DNA sequences. Structural analysis reveals that the differences in binding affinity arise from variations in enthalpy and entropy contributions. The authors show that one optimal DNA sequence is primarily bound due to an optimal enthalpic contribution, while the other is bound due to an optimal entropy. These findings challenge the assumption that TF binding is solely determined by direct protein-DNA interactions and highlight the role of water-mediated interactions. The study also suggests that similar mechanisms may be at play in other macromolecular interactions.
