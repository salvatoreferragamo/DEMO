Computational models in biology are mathematical simulations that can help us understand how biological systems work. However, these models are often difficult for non-experts to interact with because they require programming knowledge and specialized software. In this paper, Wortel and Textor present a new tool called Artistoo, which makes it possible to build and share interactive simulations in a web browser. This makes it easier for researchers to collaborate and share their models with others, and could help increase the impact of computational biology research. Artistoo can be used to model a wide range of biological systems, including the movement of cells, the spread of a virus, and the formation of tissues. It can also be used in education to teach computational biology and promote collaboration. Artistoo is an open-source tool, which means that it is freely available to anyone to use, modify, and share.
Age-related kidney disease is a condition where older people develop kidney inflammation. This inflammation is often caused by the immune cells in the kidneys not working properly. Ide et al . wanted to understand why older people are more susceptible to kidney inflammation. Ide et al . first examined the number of immune cells in mice . The results showed that the number of immune cells in the kidneys increases as mice get older . Ide et al . then looked at the type of immune cells that were present in the kidneys of older mice . The results showed that the proportion of immune cells that were produced by embryos increased as mice got older . Ide et al . then looked at the kidneys of mice that were genetically engineered to produce fluorescent proteins in immune cells . The results showed that the fluorescent proteins were produced by the immune cells in the kidneys of older mice . This suggested that the increase in immune cells in the kidneys of older mice was due to the immune cells multiplying . Further experiments showed that the fluorescent proteins were produced by immune cells in the kidneys of older mice that had been produced by the embryo . The study by Ide et al . shows that older mice have more immune cells in their kidneys . This suggests that the increase in immune cells in the kidneys of older mice may contribute to age-related kidney disease . Further research is needed to determine whether this is the case in humans .
Our brain is protected by a blood-brain barrier that stops harmful substances from entering it and also stops the brain from releasing waste products into the bloodstream . However , this barrier does not prevent waste products from entering the brain through a network of tiny channels called lymphatic vessels . This network is present in many other organs of the body , where it helps to remove waste products and circulate white blood cells . Absinta et al . have now shown that the brain also has a network of lymphatic vessels . These vessels are present in the dura mater , a layer of tissue that covers the brain and spinal cord . The presence of lymphatic vessels in the brain may have implications for its ability to remove waste products and fight infections . The findings of Absinta et al . suggest that the brain may need a network of lymphatic vessels to remove waste products and circulate white blood cells . This may be particularly important in the context of neurological diseases , such as multiple sclerosis , which is characterized by inflammation and damage to the meninges ( the protective layers of tissue that surround the brain and spinal cord ) .
Branching networks develop and pattern in such a way as to assume their functional roles in the adult organ . The study conducted by Short et al . investigated the role of nephrons in the development of branching in developing organs . The researchers found that nephrons and collecting ducts are independent structures . The results suggested that nephrons and collecting ducts have little to no impact on the progress of branching morphogenesis or the behavior of tip or cap cell progenitors in the developing organ . The study helps us understand why organs develop in a tree-like pattern .
Cells have a process called autophagy that recycles their own components to release chemical building blocks that can be used to build new components. Autophagy is important for removing damaged or unwanted cellular components, and also helps to maintain cellular health. Autophagy is initiated when a cell breaks down its own material into vesicles called autophagosomes. These autophagosomes then fuse with other vesicles called lysosomes, which are filled with enzymes that break down the cellular components. The Mon1-Ccz1 complex is a protein complex that helps to initiate autophagy by recruiting other proteins to the surface of autophagosomes. Here , the authors show that the Mon1-Ccz1 complex is specifically targeted to autophagosomes by a protein called Atg8. The Mon1-Ccz1 complex is a GEF, which is a type of protein that helps to recruit other proteins to the surface of membranes. By using a combination of biochemical and genetic experiments , the authors show that the Mon1-Ccz1 complex can be targeted to autophagosomes and can help to recruit the Rab proteins that are required for autophagy to occur. The Mon1-Ccz1 complex is also required for autophagosomes to fuse with lysosomes, which is necessary for the recycling of cellular components. The authors propose that the Mon1-Ccz1 complex could be targeted to other membranes in the cell and help to initiate different cellular processes.
The three domains of cellular life are archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes. All three groups of organisms contain genetic material that is made up of DNA and proteins known as histones. The DNA is packaged inside the histones to form structures called chromatin. Chromatin plays a crucial role in regulating the expression of genes. For example , chromatin can bind to proteins that either switch genes on or off . Chromatin is also involved in the packaging of genetic material inside the nucleus of eukaryotic cells . However , it is not clear how chromatin was first used to regulate gene expression . Ammar et al . have now studied chromatin in archaea . Archaea are single-celled organisms that live in environments with high salt concentrations . They are thought to be the closest living relatives of eukaryotes . Ammar et al . used a technique called micrococcal nuclease digestion to isolate DNA fragments that were protected by the histones from the digestion . The fragments were then sequenced and analyzed to identify the chromatin structure . The study revealed that the chromatin structure of archaea is similar to that of eukaryotes . This suggests that the fundamental role of chromatin in the regulation of gene expression might have been for the packaging of DNA rather than the regulation of gene expression .
The brain is capable of making decisions about the best course of action in a fraction of a second . The brain makes these decisions by comparing all of the available options simultaneously . However , it is not clear how the brain can do this . A few years ago , scientists showed that monkeys use a method called 'hierarchical decision making' to make decisions . This method allows the brain to compare all of the available options at the same time . However , some scientists have argued that this method is not possible . Zylberberg et al . have now re-analyzed the data from the experiments and found that the monkeys’ behavior was more consistent with a hierarchical model than a flat model . The experiments also showed that the brain can only evaluate a limited number of decisions at any one time . This means that the brain cannot evaluate all of the available options simultaneously . The results of the experiment with human volunteers also revealed that the brain can make multiple decisions while keeping the future consequences in mind .
In 1950 , a group of scientists discovered a cave in Italy called the ‘Grotta della Bàsura’ that contained traces of human footprints and bones from an extinct cave bear. The cave is located in the Dolomite Mountains and was used as a shelter by humans about 14 , 000 years ago . The cave was also home to a group of young children . The traces of footprints in the cave were examined using cutting-edge software and various techniques including 3D modeling . The researchers found that the group of humans that left the traces in the cave consisted of two adults , an adolescent , and two children . The children were three and six years old . The study suggests that young children were active members of their communities during the late Stone Age .
Fatigue is a common experience that can occur after a long day at work or after a workout. When people are tired , they may feel less motivated to perform a task . This may also be true for learning new tasks , as fatigue can impair a person's ability to remember new information . However , it is not clear how fatigue affects the learning of new skills . Branscheidt et al . asked 121 healthy volunteers to learn a new motor task . They found that the volunteers who were fatigued on the first day of training had a harder time learning the task on the following days . This suggests that fatigue can impair learning of new motor skills . However , the study also showed that fatigue does not affect learning of new thinking tasks . This suggests that fatigue may not affect memory formation in the brain . Overall , the study suggests that fatigue can impair learning of new motor skills . Understanding the effects of fatigue on learning can help design training programs that do not push people to work past fatigue .
Our sense of number is closely tied to our sense of space and our ability to move around in the world. Our brain processes both space and number in the same brain area. This is known as cortical recycling, where neurons originally designed to process space are re-purposed to process number. This idea has been around for over a decade, but it is still unclear how the same neurons process both space and number. Schwiedrzik et al . used experiments to test the idea that our brain processes both space and number in the same neurons. In these experiments, volunteers were shown a series of dots on a screen and asked to estimate how many dots were present. The volunteers initially underestimated the number of dots when the dots moved to the right, and overestimated the number of dots when the dots moved to the left. This suggests that the same neurons are being used to process space and number. The results of these experiments suggest that cortical recycling is a common occurrence in the brain, and that it allows the brain to add new functions without sacrificing any of the existing functions.
Bones are the framework that supports the body and protects vital organs. They also provide structural integrity, and regenerate themselves throughout a person's life. However, Paget's disease of bone (PDB) is a condition in which bones become misshapen and fragile, leading to complications such as pain, fractures, neurological problems, hearing loss, and even cancer. PDB is often caused by genetic changes that are inherited from one's parents. However, environmental factors can also trigger the condition, and some cases of PDB are caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Environmental triggers include persistent viral infection, repetitive mechanical loading of the skeleton, low dietary calcium intake, and exposure to environmental pollutants. PDB can be triggered by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, but the underlying causes of PDB are not fully understood.
Echolocation is the process by which bats use sound waves to navigate. They emit a high-pitched chirp and then listen to the echoes that bounce back from objects in their surroundings. By analyzing these echoes, bats can determine the distance and shape of objects around them. However , bats cannot recognize places they regularly visit because their echoes do not contain enough information to build a 3D map of the environment. Vanderelst et al . have now built an artificial bat device that can recognize places by recognizing the echoes of their own calls. The device contained ultrasonic microphones to act like the bat's ears and an ultrasonic speaker to act like the bat's mouth. Machine-learning techniques used by Vanderelst et al . showed that the echoes collected from different locations were different enough to be recognized by a computer . The simplified version of the echoes helped in recognizing locations by showing that the echoes from each location were different enough for a computer to recognize the location . The study by Vanderelst et al . suggests that bats use echolocation to recognize places . The study might help in building robots that can navigate using similar tactics by providing insights into how bats use echolocation to navigate . The study might also help us understand how bats build their cognitive maps of their surroundings .
Messager RNA carries instructions for making proteins. If the instructions are incorrect , the cell would remove the messenger RNA. A protein called SMG1 is responsible for removing messenger RNA if it is faulty . SMG1 recognizes specific patterns of amino acids in the messenger RNA and removes it if the pattern is not correct . The structure of SMG1 and the messenger RNA it recognizes has not been known until now . Langer et al . have now determined the structure of SMG1 and the messenger RNA it recognizes . The structure reveals how SMG1 recognizes the messenger RNA and why it removes it if it is faulty . Understanding how SMG1 works could lead to new ways to treat diseases that are caused by faulty messenger RNA .
Cells in the body need to grow and divide to replace damaged cells or to make more cells when there is a shortage . The cells in a growing organism also need to be able to sense when they have enough nutrients to grow . The protein mTORC2 is involved in this process and plays a role in cancer and other diseases . The structure of mTORC2 has not been known until now . In this study , the researchers used cryo-electron microscopy to study the structure of mTORC2 . They found that mTORC2 is similar in shape to mTORC1 , another protein complex involved in cell growth . The overall shape of mTORC2 is similar to mTORC1 , with two copies of mTOR arranged in a similar way . The main accessory proteins in mTORC2 are mLST8 and mS6K1 . These proteins are organized differently from those in mTORC1 . This research could lead to the development of new drugs to treat cancer and other diseases . The structure of mTORC2 can be used in the future to develop drugs that inhibit mTORC2 to treat cancer and other diseases .
DNA is made up of four chemicals called nucleotides, which are linked together in a long chain called a DNA molecule. DNA molecules are found inside the nucleus of every living cell and contain the instructions for making proteins that are essential for life . When DNA is damaged , it can become hard to read and the cell may not be able to repair it properly . This can lead to mutations that can cause the cell to become cancerous . Cancer cells often have mutations in the genes that help them repair DNA . These genes are called DNA repair genes . PARP inhibitors are drugs that are used to treat cancer by blocking DNA repair in cancer cells . However , cancer cells often develop ways to evade these drugs . One way they do this is by over-repairing DNA . This can lead to mutations that make the cancer cells more aggressive . It is not clear how cancer cells become resistant to PARP inhibitors . Now , King and Leland have developed a method to visualize DNA repair in living cells . This method could help scientists understand how cancer cells become resistant to PARP inhibitors . King and Leland found that cancer cells lacking a protein called Rev7 had faster DNA repair . This was because a different protein called RecQ helicases was more active in these cells . King and Leland suggest that RecQ helicases could be used to develop new drugs that could make cancer cells more sensitive to PARP inhibitors .
Vaccination campaigns in India aim to prevent the deaths of young children from measles. This is because measles is a common cause of death in India, and the second dose of the measles vaccine is not always given to children in India. The campaigns began in 2010 and aimed to increase vaccination rates in the country. The study found that 41,000 to 56,000 children were saved from death by the campaigns between 2010 and 2013. This represents 39-57% of the expected deaths nationally during that time period. The study suggests that India's measles immunization campaigns saved the lives of 41,000 to 56,000 children between 2010 and 2013. This could help boost vaccination rates. The campaigns aimed to introduce the second dose of the measles vaccine in its vaccine schedule.
Answer: Understanding how tuberculosis spreads is important to develop effective public health interventions to stop its transmission and prevent future outbreaks.
Signaling systems are groups of proteins that pass signals between cells. In animal development, signaling systems control how an animal develops by controlling which genes are switched on or off in different cells . One example of a signaling system is the Notch system . The Notch system works by ligands that span cell membranes binding to receptors that sit inside other cells . This binding leads to a sequence of proteolytic cleavages of the receptor releasing the Notch intracellular domain ( NICD ) from the membrane . NICD translocates into the nucleus where it enters into a complex with a CSL protein ( CBF-1/RBPJ in mammals , Suppressor of Hairless in flies , and Lag-1 in worms ) and a protein of the Mastermind family ( Petcherski and Kimble , 2000; Wu et al . , 2000; Nam et al . , 2003; Nam et al . , 2006; Wilson and Kovall , 2006; Choi et al . , 2012 ) to regulate transcription of target genes . DLL1 and DLL4 are two similar proteins that are expressed in the same tissues . However , the two proteins have different functions in development . For example , DLL1 is important for the development of the arterial vascular epithelium , whereas DLL4 is important for the development of the intestinal epithelium . Tveriakhina et al . have now investigated how the two proteins interact . This revealed that the two proteins bind to the same receptors . However , the two proteins activate different receptors at different concentrations . Tveriakhina et al . also created hybrid proteins that contained parts of both DLL1 and DLL4 . This revealed that different parts of the ligands contribute to their selectivity . Understanding ligand-receptor interactions could lead to the development of new cell-based therapies .
Antibiotics are drugs that are used to kill bacteria . Some antibiotics target the cell wall of bacteria , which is a protective outer layer that keeps antibiotics away from the bacteria's cells . Gram-negative bacteria are particularly difficult to treat because they have a strong protective layer that makes it hard for antibiotics to reach the cell wall . To survive , these bacteria develop ways to resist the antibiotics . Grabowicz et al . have now investigated how Escherichia coli , a type of Gram-negative bacteria , resists antibiotics . The researchers found that some mutant bacteria produce more peptidoglycans on their outer membrane . These peptidoglycans are a part of the protective layer of bacteria . The mutant bacteria are able to use the peptidoglycans to interfere with the antibiotic vancomycin's ability to reach the cell wall . This makes the mutant bacteria resistant to vancomycin . The results reveal that bacteria can quickly adapt to antibiotics and that the peptidoglycan layer is a key component of this protection . The findings of Grabowicz et al . highlight the challenges of treating infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria .
Cells are made up of many different types of molecules that carry out specific functions . Some of these molecules are produced inside the cell and need to be released outside the cell to perform their functions . Vesicles are small structures that carry these molecules from the inside of the cell to the outside . Vesicles can be released from the cell by attaching to proteins on the surface of the cell membrane . The proteins that attach to vesicles are called tethers . Vesicles can also be released from the cell by attaching to other proteins that form a meshwork on the surface of the cell membrane . This meshwork traps the vesicle and releases it to the outside of the cell . The proteins that form this meshwork are called tethering proteins . The discovery of a new tethering protein called GCC185 provides new insight into how vesicles move inside cells . It was discovered that GCC185 binds to vesicles at the end of the protein . This binding causes the vesicle to release its contents to the outside of the cell . The discovery of GCC185 suggests that vesicles may be captured by flexible tethers that are able to adapt to the shape of the vesicle .
The roots of plants are underground organs that are responsible for absorbing water and minerals from the soil . As the roots grow , they can change shape to adapt to the environment . For example , roots can grow deeper in the soil to access water and nutrients that are further away . However , it is difficult to study the shape of roots in the soil , as they are often hidden from view . Now , Duan et al . have developed a system that allows researchers to study the shape and function of roots in the soil . This system uses a live-imaging platform to allow growing roots to be visualized when plants are grown in thin , soil-filled , transparent pots . This allows researchers to study the growth and development of roots in real time , and to track the activity of genes in roots . The system also allows researchers to track the environmental conditions that the roots are exposed to , such as the amount of water in the soil . This could help to improve our understanding of how plants respond to environmental conditions , and could help to develop new ways to grow crops that are more resilient to drought and other environmental challenges .
Proteins are the building blocks of all living organisms . They are made up of long chains of amino acids . These chains fold into specific shapes that determine the protein’s function . Some proteins fold into a specific shape that allows them to interact with other molecules . Other proteins fold into a shape that is less specific , and can interact with a wide variety of molecules . The shape of a protein determines how it functions , and can also affect how it interacts with other molecules . Schmid and Hugel studied how the shape of a protein called Hsp90 is regulated . Hsp90 is a protein that is always found in pairs . It is involved in many cellular processes , including metabolism and protein folding . The study found that Hsp90 can fold into a variety of shapes , and that the shape of Hsp90 can regulate its function . The study also found that Hsp90 can be regulated by a variety of molecular interactions . These interactions include the protein folding into a specific shape , and also the interactions between Hsp90 and other molecules . The study suggests that the shape of a protein can regulate its function . This idea is important because it suggests that the shape of a protein can be modified to change its function . This could be useful for developing new treatments for diseases .
DNA carries the instructions to make proteins, which are the building blocks of cells . The instructions are written in a language that cells can read , and the language is made up of four different chemicals called nucleotides . The sequence of nucleotides in DNA determines the sequence of amino acids in proteins . The sequence of nucleotides in RNA , the other molecule that carries instructions to make proteins , is similar to the sequence of nucleotides in DNA . However , the nucleotides in RNA can sometimes be different from the ones in DNA . This is known as a transcript error . Transcript errors can be caused by a number of different factors , including errors in the copying of DNA into RNA , errors in the copying of RNA into DNA , and errors in the final assembly of proteins . Transcript errors can have a big impact on how well a cell works . For example , a cell may need to produce a protein to fix a damaged part of its DNA . If the cell makes a transcript error when it makes the protein , the protein may not be able to fix the damaged part of the DNA . This could lead to the cell dying . To find out how often cells make transcript errors , Li and Lynch developed a new method to detect transcript errors in bacteria . They then used the new method to study the transcripts of four different bacterial species . Li and Lynch found that bacteria make thousands of transcript errors every time they make a protein . The transcript errors were found to be more frequent in the end of the RNA molecule than in the middle . This suggests that the errors in the RNA sequence are important for how well the cells work . However , it is not yet clear how the errors in the RNA sequence affect the cells . Future studies will be needed to understand the impact of transcript errors on the function of cells .
Answer: Parkinson's disease is caused by the death of brain cells. Question: How many genes have been linked to Parkinson's disease? Answer: Nearly 20 genes. Question: What is the role of PINK1 in cells? Answer: PINK1 helps cells to produce energy. Question: What is the three-dimensional structure of PINK1? Answer: The three-dimensional structure of PINK1 reveals new details of its interactions with other proteins and helps scientists understand its role in the death of brain cells. Question: What does the study of PINK1's structure help in developing new treatments for Parkinson's disease? Answer: The study of PINK1's structure can help in developing new treatments for Parkinson's disease. Question: How can the knowledge of PINK1's structure help in developing new treatments for Parkinson's disease? Answer: Knowledge of PINK1's structure can help in developing new treatments for Parkinson's disease by revealing how it interacts with other molecules and its role in the death of brain cells. Below is a paper. 1 Introduction Autosomal recessive inherited loss-of-function mutations in human PTEN-induced kinase 1 ( hPINK1 ) , represent the second most frequent cause of early-onset Parkinson’s disease ( PD ) ( Valente et al . , 2004 ) . hPINK1 has been proposed to act as a master regulator of mitochondrial quality control , promoting the elimination of damaged mitochondria via autophagy known as mitophagy ( McWilliams and Muqit , 2017 ) . In response to mitochondrial depolarization , hPINK1 is activated and phosphorylates ubiquitin at Serine65 ( Ser65 ) . Ser65-phosphorylated ubiquitin then binds to the ubiquitin E3 ligase Parkin with high affinity , serving to prime Parkin for phosphorylation by hPINK1 at an equivalent Ser65 residue that lies within its N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain ( Ubl ) ( Kondapalli et al . , 2012; Kazlauskaite et al . , 2014; Kane et al . , 2014; Koyano et al . , 2014) . This chain of phosphorylation events stimulates maximal activation of Parkin E3 ligase activity , resulting in ubiquitin and Parkin Ubl phosphorylation . The molecular mechanisms of hPINK1 activation and substrate recognition are poorly understood . We have previously identified a hPINK1 orthologue in Tribolium castaneum ( TcPINK1 ) , which in contrast to human hPINK1 , almost entirely lacks the first kinase domain insertion ( Ins1 ) , and exhibits constitutive catalytic activity towards ubiquitin , Parkin and generic substrates in vitro ( Woodroof et al . , 2011 ) . TcPINK1 exhibits structural similarity to hPINK1 and has a role in regulating mitophagy . Herein , we report the crystal structure of TcPINK1 , revealing structural insights into the CTE and kinase domain loop insertions . In particular , we show that the third insertion contributes to formation of a bowl-shaped binding site for ubiquitin that is critical for either TcPINK1 or hPINK1 mediated ubiquitin and Parkin Ubl phosphorylation . Furthermore , we have elaborated an important regulatory role for TcPINK1 autophosphorylation of Ser205 , which together with the third insertion , aids in physiological substrate recognition . Overall , these findings provide molecular insights into the mechanisms of hPINK1 kinase activity , ubiquitin substrate recognition , and define the molecular basis of Parkinson’s disease-causing mutations . 2 Results and discussion The crystal structure of a catalytically active fragment of TcPINK1 was solved and refined to 2 . 78 Å using E . coli expression of a cDNA construct encompassing the kinase domain and CTE ( Ser150 - Asp570 ) , and possessing mutations to reduce surface entropy ( Glu527
Moths use pheromones to communicate with other moths of the same species and to attract them to mate . The main purpose of pheromones in moths is to allow males and females of the same species to recognize each other before mating . The evolution of pheromone receptors in moths has not been well understood . Bastin-Héline et al . now reveal that pheromone receptors have evolved independently in moths at least twice . This discovery opens up new avenues for deciphering pheromone communication in moths . It also suggests that pheromone receptors could have played a role in the emergence of new species in moths .
The visual cortex is responsible for processing visual information and sending it to the rest of the brain . It is also sensitive to the context in which it is processed , and the behavior of the animal can influence how the visual cortex processes visual information . For example , movement can increase the gain of visual responses , which is the amount of information that the visual cortex can extract from a given visual stimulus . However , it is still unclear how the visual cortex processes visual information and how movement affects the activity of neurons in the visual cortex . Pakan et al . used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI ) to record the activity of neurons in the visual cortex of mice while they were either running on a treadmill or staying still . The experiments showed that the activity of inhibitory neurons in the visual cortex changes depending on the context in which the animal is running . This suggests that inhibitory neurons are dynamic and can respond differently depending on the behavior of the animal . The experiments also showed that the activity of excitatory neurons was affected by movement , and that the activity of inhibitory neurons was strongly influenced by the activity of excitatory neurons . The findings of the study reveal more about the dynamic nature of inhibitory activity in the brain and how movement affects the activity of neurons in the visual cortex . Future experiments will be necessary to understand how movement affects the activity of neurons in the visual cortex and how it controls the gain of visual responses .
Many proteins in the body can bind to DNA . This interaction is important for controlling which genes are switched on or off . Understanding how proteins bind to DNA is important for understanding how genes are regulated . However , it is difficult to study how proteins bind to DNA because the interactions between proteins and DNA are weak and difficult to measure . To overcome this challenge , researchers are now using a technique called isothermal titration calorimetry ( ITC ) . This technique measures the energy of protein-DNA interactions . The researchers used ITC to study how four different human proteins bind to DNA . The four proteins are called HIF1α , NF-κB , PPARγ , and p53 . The results showed that two of the proteins , HIF1α and PPARγ , bind to two different DNA sequences . The two DNA sequences were similar in terms of their shape , but they were different in terms of their chemical composition . This suggests that the two proteins bind to the DNA sequences through different mechanisms . The results also showed that one of the proteins , NF-κB , binds to two different DNA sequences through a single mechanism . This suggests that the binding mechanism of NF-κB is different from the other proteins . The results are important because they show that some proteins can bind to two different DNA sequences with similar strengths . This could have important implications for drug development . For example , if a drug binds to a protein that can bind to two different DNA sequences , then it could be used to treat two different diseases .
The metabolism of microbial populations is a complex process that helps us understand how microbes interact with their environment and how they respond to stress . A cell's metabolism is the process by which it converts the energy and nutrients it takes in into the energy and materials it needs to survive and grow . In a microbial population , cells often specialize in different metabolic processes . However , it was not clear whether microbial populations specialize into metabolic subpopulations or all cells act in unison . Rosenthal et al . have now shown that Bacillus subtilis , a common soil bacterium , specializes into metabolic subpopulations with distinct growth rates and release distinct metabolic products . This discovery could help evolutionary biologists understand how bacterial populations can adapt to different environments . It could also lead to better industrial processes . For example , understanding how cells specialize into different metabolic processes could help scientists design more efficient industrial processes .
Systemic light chain amyloidosis is a condition where a protein called immunoglobulin light chain forms fibers that damage organs . The protein is produced by the immune system , but the cause of the disease is not known . The immune protein causes the light chains to form fibers by joining them together . The protein switches between forming dimers ( two light chains together ) and monomers ( one light chain alone ) . This switch is not understood . The fibers can be broken down by chemicals called ligands . Brumshtein , Esswein et al . searched for ligands that could bind to the immune protein and prevent it from switching between monomers and dimers . The experiments identified four ligands . The two most effective ligands were methylene blue and sulfasalazine . These molecules were also found to bind to the immune protein . Methylene blue and sulfasalazine were shown to bind to the immune protein at the same site . This suggests that these ligands could be used to prevent the immune protein switching between monomers and dimers . This could prevent the fibers from forming . The results suggest that methylene blue and sulfasalazine could be used to treat systemic light chain amyloidosis . However , more work is needed to see if these molecules are safe and effective in people .
Cancer cells are cells that have become abnormal and are able to grow and divide uncontrollably . This process is driven by changes in the activity of genes that code for proteins . Epigenetic changes , which occur when the activity of genes is altered , are a key feature of cancer cells . Epigenetic changes can affect how genes are used to make proteins , and are thought to play a role in the development of cancer . Grosso et al . have now investigated epigenetic changes in kidney cancer cells . The results suggest that epigenetic changes may be more important than previously thought in the development of kidney cancer . In particular , Grosso et al . found that many genes are not turned off when they are supposed to be . This is because the process of turning off genes is not working properly in kidney cancer cells . Grosso et al . also found that many genes are being turned on in kidney cancer cells . This is because the process of turning on genes is working properly in kidney cancer cells . Grosso et al . found that these epigenetic changes were associated with a poorer survival rate in kidney cancer patients . These findings suggest that epigenetic changes are an important feature of kidney cancer and may be a potential therapeutic target .
The main function of the kidneys is to filter waste out of the bloodstream to produce urine. Nephrons are the structures responsible for filtering waste from the blood to produce urine. The number of nephrons present in each kidney varies greatly in the human population with a count of 250 , 000 and 2 . 5 million glomeruli per kidney being considered as normal . However , lower nephron numbers have been directly linked with hypertension and a higher risk of developing renal diseases . The main goal of this study was to understand the role of R-spondins in kidney development . R-spondins are a family of secreted molecules that are known to play a role in controlling the development of the kidneys . The study used mice with genetic modifications to delete the R-spondin genes in the kidneys . The results showed that R-spondins are required to maintain the pool of nephron progenitor cells throughout development . Moreover , R-spondins are required to allow nephron progenitors to engage in differentiation and undergo a process called mesenchyme-epithelial transition to become nephrons . Understanding the role of R-spondins and WNT/β-catenin signalling in kidney development could help to identify new targets for treating chronic kidney disease .
Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that develops from pigment cells called melanocytes . Melanoma cells are highly aggressive and can spread to other parts of the body . The lymph nodes are a common place for melanoma cells to spread to and they can cause significant harm . Although the lymph nodes are often the first stop for melanoma cells , the exact mechanisms that allow them to survive and grow within the lymph nodes are not fully understood . This research aims to understand how melanoma cells survive and grow within the lymph nodes . The researchers used a mouse model to investigate the interactions between melanoma cells and macrophages in the lymph nodes . Macrophages are a type of immune cell that are found in the lymph nodes and play a role in the immune response . The researchers found that melanoma cells bind to a protein called Siglec1 on the surface of macrophages . This interaction helps the melanoma cells to survive and grow within the lymph nodes . The researchers also found that melanoma cells that did not bind to Siglec1 were unable to survive and grow within the lymph nodes . The researchers believe that understanding how melanoma cells survive and grow within the lymph nodes could lead to new treatments for melanoma .
Sleep is an important part of a healthy lifestyle , and scientists have been interested in how sleep affects the brain for over 100 years . However , studying sleep in animals has been difficult because it is hard to monitor sleep patterns . Now , Szuperak et al . have created a new device that can track the sleep patterns of fruit fly larvae . The device , called the LarvaLodge , uses a camera to monitor the larvae for 6 hours a day . This allowed the researchers to observe the larvae sleeping , and they found that fruit fly larvae indeed sleep . The researchers also discovered that sleep is necessary for the larvae to grow and develop properly . These findings show that sleep is important for the brain , and that it plays a role in brain development . Further studies could help to determine whether sleep is important in brain development in humans and other animals .
DNA helicases are enzymes that copy genetic information from DNA . They work by unwinding the DNA double helix and then moving along the strands to read the sequence of nucleotides . However , little is known about how the helicases move along the DNA . In this study , the researchers examined the movement of a DNA helicase called G40P in the bacteria that cause tuberculosis . The experiments showed that the helicase unwinds the DNA one letter of genetic code at a time , and that the bacterial enzyme DnaG helps the helicase to move along the DNA . The study suggests that the unwinding process may be slowed down or stopped by specific sequences of letters within the DNA molecules . The findings may help to develop new ways to stop bacteria from copying their DNA , which could become new antibiotics to treat bacterial infections .
The DNA in an organism contains the genetic instructions for the development and function of the organism . The DNA is made up of a double helix , with two strands of nucleotides that are held together by hydrogen bonds . The nucleotides are the building blocks of DNA , and the sequence of nucleotides in DNA determines the genetic instructions . The DNA is packaged into structures called chromosomes , which are contained within the nucleus of the cell . The DNA in a cell is replicated during cell division to ensure that the new cells contain an exact copy of the DNA . Mitochondria are structures within a cell that convert energy from the food we eat into energy that the cell can use . They contain their own DNA , called mtDNA , which is separate from the DNA found in the nucleus . Mitochondria have their own set of genetic instructions , which determine the functions of the mitochondria . Mitochondria have their own DNA , which is inherited from the mother . However , the mtDNA in an organism is not always identical , as it can be passed on from mother to child with variations . These variations can lead to a wide range of effects , from healthy individuals to those with mitochondrial diseases . The mtDNA in an organism is replicated by a process called homologous recombination . This process involves the exchange of genetic information between two copies of DNA . This exchange can result in the creation of new combinations of genetic information , which can lead to new traits . Recombination also helps to maintain the integrity of the mtDNA , by repairing breaks in the DNA . However , the mtDNA in an organism is not very active , and the processes of homologous recombination are not well understood . In this study , Ma et al . have investigated whether homologous recombination occurs in the mtDNA of fruit flies . This is the first time that homologous recombination has been observed in the mtDNA of fruit flies . Ma et al . used fruit flies that were heteroplasmic for two mutant mtDNA genotypes . This means that the flies had two different mtDNA genotypes in the same cell , and each genotype was active at different times . This allowed Ma et al . to observe the recombination between the two mtDNA genotypes . Ma et al . observed that the mutant mtDNA genotype that had a defect in function was eliminated from the population , and replaced with a new genotype that had a combination of the defective and functional mtDNA genotypes . This meant that the new genotype had a strong drive to survive . However , the mutant mtDNA genotype also had a defect that caused the flies to die . This suggests that homologous recombination can act as a way to reduce the negative effects of mutations . Recombination can also be used to manipulate the mtDNA of fruit flies . For example , Ma et al . created a new genotype that had a combination of the defective and functional mtDNA genotypes . This genotype had a strong drive to survive , but did not have the defect that caused the flies to die . This suggests that homologous recombination could be used to create new genotypes that have desirable traits .
The role of Rab proteins is to act as molecular switches in cells . They are activated by GDP-loading proteins called GEFs , and inactivated by GTP-hydrolysing proteins called GAPs . GEFs and GAPs bind to specific regions on the Rab proteins , called switch regions . The switch region contains a glutamine residue , which is thought to be important for GDP-loading and GTP-hydrolysis . Langemeyer et al . have now studied the role of the switch region in the activation of Rab proteins . This revealed that the switch region is actually important for different types of GEFs , and that the activation mechanism of Rab proteins has been conserved over evolution . The findings of Langemeyer et al . suggest that different Rab proteins are activated by different GEFs . This means that the evolution of the Rab subfamily of proteins is more complex than previously thought . The study also suggests that small molecule inhibitors could be developed to target these mechanistically discrete pathways and associated switch II conformations .
Tuberculosis is a bacterial disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis . It is difficult to control because the bacteria that cause it can spread when an infected individual coughs or sneezes . The bacteria that cause tuberculosis in humans are divided into seven lineages . These lineages have different abilities to cause disease and spread in the community . Guerra-Assunção et al . studied the spread of tuberculosis in the Karonga district of Malawi . The researchers collected DNA samples from 1700 patients with tuberculosis and used whole genome sequencing to identify the lineage of each patient . The data showed that the bacteria responsible for tuberculosis in Malawi could be divided into different lineages , and that these lineages had different abilities to cause disease and spread in the community . Guerra-Assunção et al . also showed that the proportion of patients with recent tuberculosis transmission decreased over time . This suggests that the tuberculosis and HIV control programmes in the area have been successful . Understanding why different lineages of the bacteria that cause tuberculosis differ in their ability to cause disease and spread is an important next challenge for understanding tuberculosis transmission .
When we learn new information , we often group it into categories and relate it to things we already know . For example , we might learn the names of different animals and categorize them as ‘mammals’ or ‘birds’ . Luyckx et al . now show that humans use the same way of organizing information when learning about new stimuli . The researchers asked volunteers to associate numbers with different images . The volunteers learned to rank the images based on how rewarding they were . The neural signals that the volunteers produced also followed a pattern of structural alignment . This means that the volunteers’ brain activity followed a pattern of organizing information in their minds based on how things were structured in the world . These findings suggest that we learn new information by organizing it in a way that makes sense to us .
The main cause of dementia is Alzheimer’s disease . The disease is caused by the buildup of a protein called beta-amyloid in the brain . The brain is active when we think and remember things , and this activity can lead to the buildup of beta-amyloid . Previous studies have shown that older adults with higher levels of beta-amyloid activity have more amyloid in their brains . However , it was not clear if the brain activity itself was the cause of the amyloid buildup , or if it was a result of the amyloid buildup . To investigate this , Mormino et al . studied 27 older adults with no dementia who had a PET scan to measure the amount of beta-amyloid in their brains . The participants were also given a memory test that measured how well they could remember words . The results showed that older adults with higher levels of brain activity in the hippocampus , a brain region involved in memory , had more beta-amyloid in their brains . Mormino et al . also found that older adults with higher levels of brain activity in the hippocampus had more decline in memory performance over time . These findings suggest that brain activity may play a role in the buildup of beta-amyloid . This could lead to the development of new treatments that target the brain activity . For example , drugs that decrease the amount of brain activity in the hippocampus may help to prevent the buildup of beta-amyloid .
The brain is made up of billions of cells , each with thousands of genes . When a cell is exposed to a drug , the genes within the cell can be activated or deactivated . These changes in gene activity can lead to the creation of new connections between cells , or the strengthening of existing connections . The strengthening of connections between cells can lead to long-term changes in behavior , such as the development of drug addiction . The cocaine drug is a powerful stimulant that is often abused . Cocaine works by binding to a class of receptors on the surface of brain cells called dopamine receptors . This binding leads to the activation of a cascade of genes within the brain that are involved in the formation of new connections between cells . Mukherjee, Gonzales et al . have now studied the effects of cocaine on the brain by examining the activity of genes in mice that had been exposed to the drug . The results suggest that cocaine can activate a large number of genes in the brain , and that the genes that are activated may be responsible for the long-term changes in behavior that occur after cocaine use . Mukherjee, Gonzales et al . also found that the activity of certain genes in the brain was dependent on the history of cocaine exposure . For example , the activity of some genes was higher in mice that had been exposed to cocaine for longer periods of time . Mukherjee, Gonzales et al . also found that the activity of a specific set of genes in the brain was responsible for the development of cocaine addiction in mice . The genes that were responsible for this addiction were located in a region of the brain called the striatum . The striatum is involved in the formation of new connections between cells , and is also responsible for the development of compulsive behaviors . The results of this study provide a better understanding of how cocaine works in the brain , and how it leads to drug addiction . These findings may also help to identify potential targets for the treatment of cocaine addiction .
The immune system protects our body from infections and diseases . It does this by identifying foreign invaders such as viruses and bacteria and destroying them . Cancer cells are foreign invaders that have changed into a different form and can cause harm to the body . To protect ourselves from cancer , we need to find a way to destroy the cancer cells . This can be difficult because cancer cells often have ways to hide from the immune system . Morrissey et al . wanted to find a way to make the immune system recognize cancer cells more easily . To do this , they created a new type of receptor called a Chimeric Antigen Receptor ( CAR ) . This receptor is made up of a protein called a CAR-P . The CAR-P is designed to recognize a protein called CD19 , which is found on cancer cells . When the CAR-P binds to the CD19 protein , it triggers an immune response that kills the cancer cells . This process is called phagocytosis . This means that the immune cells engulf the cancer cells and break them down to pieces . Morrissey et al . then wanted to find out if the CAR-P could be used to kill cancer cells in living animals . They tested the CAR-P in mice with cancer cells . The CAR-P was able to kill the cancer cells in the mice . This suggests that the CAR-P could be used to treat cancer in humans . Future studies will be needed to test this further .
The lungs of people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) become inflamed and damaged , which can make breathing difficult . The inflammation in the lungs is caused by a type of white blood cell called a neutrophil . Neutrophils are important in the body's defense against infections , but when they are active for too long , they die by a process called apoptosis . In COPD , neutrophils die by apoptosis , which makes the condition worse . However , there are no existing treatments that can specifically treat the inflammation in COPD . Now , researchers have identified drugs that could be used to treat COPD . The drugs , called kinase inhibitors , are already used to treat some types of cancer . The researchers tested these drugs on cells and mice with COPD . The results showed that the drugs reduced the number of neutrophils in the lungs of mice with COPD . This suggests that the drugs could help treat COPD . The researchers also tested the drugs on human neutrophils . The results showed that the drugs accelerated the death of neutrophils in these cells . This suggests that the drugs could also help treat COPD in humans . The researchers are now planning to conduct further studies to confirm that the drugs are safe and effective in humans .
Life expectancy is the average number of years that a person can expect to live, and it has been steadily increasing in many countries. This is because of improvements in healthcare and lifestyle choices. However, there is a limit to how long people can live, and the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a temporary decline in life expectancy. Janssen et al . wanted to know what the average life expectancy for men and women in Europe will be in the future. They used data from 18 European countries to estimate life expectancy at birth for men and women over the 1990–2014 period . They then used statistical methods to predict the future life expectancy for men and women in Europe . Janssen et al . found that men and women in Europe will live longer than they do now . Men will live to an average age of 83 . 4 years , up from 78 . 3 years in 2014 . Women will live to an average age of 83 . 8 years , up from 82 . 7 years in 2014 . This is because of improvements in healthcare and lifestyle choices . Janssen et al . also found that men and women in different countries will live longer than they do now . The most significant increase in life expectancy will be in Hungary , where men will live to an average age of 91 . 4 years and women will live to an average age of 92 . 8 years . Janssen et al . found that the predictions of life expectancy made by the United Nations and Eurostat are lower than theirs . This is because Janssen et al . took into account the effects of lifestyle factors , such as smoking and obesity , on mortality . Janssen et al . hope that their findings will help policymakers to prepare for the future .
Ageing is one of the biggest challenges in biology . It is a complex and slow process that takes a long time to study . Studying ageing is hard because ageing is a common phenomenon that affects all humans . This means that it is hard to study ageing in a large number of people . To overcome this challenge , researchers have used genome-wide association studies to look for genetic variants that affect lifespan . However , these studies have only identified a few genetic variants that affect lifespan . To find more , Pilling et al . studied the genetic variants that affect lifespan in 1 , 012 , 240 European-ancestry parents of UK Biobank . They used a statistical method called kin-cohort analysis to study the genetic variants that affect lifespan in parents . They found that 12 genetic variants affect lifespan . The genetic variants that affect lifespan are located near genes that control how the body processes cholesterol and other fats . These genes also control how the body responds to cancer , cardiovascular disease , and other diseases that affect lifespan . Pilling et al . also found that the genetic variants that affect lifespan are enriched for genes that are involved in the transport of fats in the body . These genes also control how the body responds to cancer , cardiovascular disease , and other diseases that affect lifespan . The genetic variants that affect lifespan are also associated with a higher risk of cancer and heart disease . However , the genetic variants that affect lifespan do not affect the rate of ageing . This suggests that genetic variants that affect lifespan do not control the underlying biological processes that cause ageing . The findings of Pilling et al . show that genome-wide association studies can be used to study lifespan . The findings also show that the genetic variants that affect lifespan are linked to the same genes that control how the body processes fats and responds to disease .
DNA encodes the genetic information that every cell needs to work properly . The DNA is packaged into tightly coiled structures called chromosomes . The chromosomes are then organized inside the cell in a specific way . In Escherichia coli bacteria , the protein H-NS is responsible for controlling which genes are active in the cell . H-NS is a protein that forms long filaments in DNA . These filaments are thought to be important for controlling the activity of genes . However , the precise mechanism by which H-NS controls the activity of genes is not fully understood . Van der Valk et al . have now investigated how H-NS organizes DNA inside E. coli bacteria . The experiments revealed that H-NS can form two different types of structures in DNA . The first structure is a stiff filament that can stretch over long distances . The second structure is a bridge that connects two strands of DNA . Van der Valk et al . found that the strength of the bridge depends on the amount of magnesium ions present . The experiments also showed that H-NS can be ‘activated’ by magnesium ions . This ‘activation’ changes the structure of H-NS and makes it able to form the bridge . The experiments also revealed that other proteins can affect how H-NS works . These proteins can either make it harder or easier for H-NS to form the bridge . The results of this study show that H-NS plays an important role in controlling the activity of genes in E. coli bacteria . The findings of the study could be applied to develop new antibiotic drugs that target H-NS proteins in bacteria .
Somites are groups of cells that form in animals during embryonic development . They are important to understand because they form the basic building blocks of the body . However , it has been difficult to study somite formation in humans because it is not possible to obtain human embryonic cells in the lab . Budjan et al . grew human stem cells in the lab as three-dimensional structures called organoids . These organoids were able to form somite-like structures in the lab , which are similar to the structures that form in the embryo . These results provide a way to study human somite formation and development in the lab for the first time .
Vaccines are the main purpose of the vaccines in preventing severe COVID-19. The immune system uses T cells to fight off viruses and other pathogens. T cells are a type of immune cell that coordinate the immune response and kill infected cells. The T cells of people who had never had COVID-19 before were found to have a different phenotype than those of people who had recovered from COVID-19. This suggests that the T cells of people who had recovered from COVID-19 may have different characteristics than those of people who had never had the disease. The findings suggest that understanding how T cells protect against COVID-19 could lead to new ways to prevent severe illness.
Cells move and spread to form new tissues and to heal wounds . In cancer , these processes are altered and the cells can spread to other parts of the body , causing the disease to progress . In cancer , a protein called Ras is often mutated , leading to the cells moving and spreading abnormally . The Ras protein is activated when it binds to a molecule called GTP . The Ras protein is a key player in the cell signaling pathways that control cell movement and spread . In this study , the researchers have found that the Ras protein is activated by a protein called RalB . The researchers used a technique called optogenetics to activate RalB in human cells . This allowed the researchers to study how RalB contributes to the spread of cancer cells . The results show that RalB is responsible for a key step in the spread of cancer cells , and that it may be a target for new cancer drugs .
Congenital heart disease is the most common birth defect . It is caused by abnormalities in the heart during development . One common cause of congenital heart disease is high blood sugar levels in the mother during pregnancy . However , the exact reason why high blood sugar levels cause heart problems is not yet clear . Nakano et al . used human embryonic stem cells to study how high blood sugar levels affect the heart . Nakano et al . found that high blood sugar levels inhibited the heart cells from maturing . The experiments also showed that the inhibition of heart cell maturation was caused by the high levels of sugar in the cells . The experiments also showed that blocking the pathway that produces sugar in the cells could prevent the inhibition of heart cell maturation . Nakano et al . then used experiments on mice to show that high blood sugar levels in pregnant mice also inhibited the heart cells from maturing . These experiments also showed that the inhibition of heart cell maturation was caused by the high levels of sugar in the cells . The findings of Nakano et al . reveal how high blood sugar levels in the mother can lead to heart problems in the fetus . The findings also suggest that preventing high blood sugar levels in pregnant women could help to prevent congenital heart disease .
Every cell in an organism contains the same set of genetic instructions . This is because the genetic instructions are copied into RNA molecules . The RNA molecules then travel to the cell’s nucleus , where they are transcribed into proteins . The instructions for making proteins are written in a language of four letters , which are read by the cell’s machinery . This language is called the genetic code . The genetic code is read by a group of proteins called transcription factors , which bind to specific sections of the genetic code . The transcription factors then recruit another group of proteins called RNA polymerases to make the RNA molecules . These RNA molecules are then transcribed into proteins . JMJD6 is a protein that is thought to be involved in this process . JMJD6 is known to bind to RNA molecules , and it is also known to be involved in the regulation of transcription . However , the exact role of JMJD6 is still not clear . The new study reveals that JMJD6 is a protease . Proteases are enzymes that break down proteins . The study found that JMJD6 breaks down a protein called MePCE , which is part of a complex called the 7SK snRNP . The 7SK snRNP is important for the transcription of genes . When JMJD6 breaks down MePCE , it helps to release the RNA polymerases and recruit them to the genes that need to be transcribed . This process is important for the regulation of gene expression . The study also showed that the activity of JMJD6 is important for the transcription of genes . If the activity of JMJD6 is reduced , the transcription of genes is also reduced . The study also identified a new family of proteases , which are called molecular scissors . These proteases are thought to be involved in the regulation of gene expression . The new family of proteases includes JMJD6 and related enzymes . The study shows that the activity of JMJD6 is essential for the transcription of genes . Further studies are needed to understand the role of JMJD6 in the regulation of gene expression .
Stem cells in the bone marrow are responsible for producing the different types of blood cells in the body . In patients with myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) , the stem cells are unable to produce the right number of blood cells , which leads to a weakened immune system and an increased risk of developing blood cancer . MDS patients often have a missing section of chromosome 7 , which is thought to play a role in the development of the disease . Wong et al . used mice to study the effects of a missing section of chromosome 7 on the function of the stem cells . The mice were genetically engineered to have a missing section of chromosome 7 in their stem cells . The mice had difficulty producing mature blood cells , and their bone marrow contained too many stem cells . The mice also had a higher proportion of stem cells that were biased towards producing blood cells that are involved in the immune system . These results suggest that the missing section of chromosome 7 in MDS patients may contribute to the development of the disease . The findings of Wong et al . could help scientists understand how MDS develops and how it could be treated .
The artemisinin-based antimalarial drug is a crucial treatment for malaria . However , resistance to this drug has emerged in parts of Asia and South America . In Guyana , a country in South America where the malaria parasite is endemic , a mutation known as the pfk13 C580Y has been detected in some patients . This mutation is thought to be the reason why the artemisinin-based drug does not work as well as it should in this region . To investigate this , Mathieu et al . analyzed 854 samples of malaria parasites collected in Guyana between 2016 and 2017 . The analysis revealed that the pfk13 C580Y mutation was present in 1 . 6% of the samples . These findings suggest that the pfk13 C580Y mutation is still circulating in Guyana . The pfk13 C580Y mutation is thought to reduce the effectiveness of the artemisinin-based drug by slowing down the growth of the parasite . This could lead to the drug becoming less effective over time . To confirm this , Mathieu et al . genetically edited parasites from Guyana and French Guiana ( a neighboring country ) to carry the pfk13 C580Y mutation . The experiments showed that the mutation reduces the ability of the parasite to grow in the laboratory . This suggests that the mutation may also reduce the ability of the parasite to grow in the human body . The results of Mathieu et al . suggest that the pfk13 C580Y mutation is still present in Guyana . This is concerning because the mutation reduces the effectiveness of the artemisinin-based drug and could lead to the drug becoming less effective over time . This could have serious consequences for patients in Guyana and the surrounding region .
Almost every process in a living cell involves proteins . However , it is not easy to study how proteins interact with each other and how they move within a cell . To overcome this challenge , scientists use a technique called single-particle tracking to observe proteins moving and interacting within a cell . This involves using a laser to excite a protein and then capturing images of the protein using a microscope . However , this method has its challenges . For example , it is difficult to determine how fast the protein is moving and how many proteins are present in the cell . To overcome these challenges , Hansen , Woringer et al . have developed a new software package called Spot-On . This software can help scientists analyze the data generated by single-particle tracking experiments . The software is designed to correct for several biases in the data , such as how fast the protein is moving and how many proteins are present in the cell . It also allows scientists to analyze the data in a more efficient way . In the future , Hansen , Woringer et al . hope to use Spot-On to study how proteins move within a cell and how this movement helps to control the behavior of cells .
Alexander disease is a rare and fatal neurodegenerative condition that affects infants and children . It is caused by mutations in a gene that is essential for the structure of astrocytes , the cells that help to maintain the structure of the brain . The mutations cause the astrocytes to produce a protein called GFAP . This protein is a key component of the cytoskeleton of the astrocytes , and is essential for the health of the brain . However , the exact role of GFAP in Alexander disease is still not clear . Battaglia et al . have now investigated the role of GFAP in Alexander disease . The results show that a phosphorylation process in the astrocytes is important for the structure of GFAP and the health of the brain . Battaglia et al . found that a phosphorylation site on GFAP was strongly elevated in the astrocytes of patients with Alexander disease . The phosphorylation of this site was also associated with the formation of abnormal structures in the astrocytes . Battaglia et al . also found that the protein caspase-6 , which is involved in the breakdown of GFAP , was more active in the astrocytes of Alexander disease patients . The results suggest that the phosphorylation of GFAP and the activity of caspase-6 may be important for the development of Alexander disease . The findings of Battaglia et al . could help to identify new potential treatments for Alexander disease .
Antibodies are proteins that recognize and bind to pathogens , triggering an immune response that blocks the infection . In the case of malaria , antibodies recognize a protein called circumsporozoite protein ( CSP ) on the surface of the malaria-causing parasite . Antibodies that recognize CSP can block the infection , but the current challenge is developing a more effective vaccine . One of the most advanced vaccines is made from a protein called mAb 3D11 , which recognizes a spiral-like structure on the surface of the malaria-causing parasite . The structure of the CSP repeat , which is recognized by mAb 3D11 , was not known . Now , Kucharska et al . have used a combination of biophysical and molecular techniques to reveal the structure of the CSP repeat recognized by mAb 3D11 . The results show that mAb 3D11 binds to the CSP repeat in a spiral-like conformation , which is similar to the structure of the PfCSP repeat recognized by human mAb 311 . These findings suggest that the spiral-like conformation of the CSP repeat recognized by mAb 3D11 could be used to develop new antibody-based vaccines against malaria .
In biology, microscopes are essential tools for studying living tissues . The purpose of using microscopes is to study living tissues in high detail . However , conventional lenses in microscopes produce blurry images . To overcome this problem , researchers have been trying to develop new lenses with higher resolution . However , designing such lenses is difficult . Now , researchers have developed a new type of lens called the Mesolens . The Mesolens can produce images with up to four times higher resolution than conventional lenses . This means that it can produce detailed images of living tissues with much higher resolution than conventional microscopes . The Mesolens lens can also be used in the future for studying many biological processes . The study aims to develop a new technique that can magnify samples by up to four times in much higher detail than conventional microscopes .
Bacteria and viruses are collectively known as pathogens that can infect and cause disease in humans, animals, and plants . These pathogens have evolved ways to evade the host immune system and can also develop resistance to antibiotics . Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria and can be used to kill bacteria and prevent the spread of antibiotic resistance . One of the ways in which bacteriophages can kill bacteria is by producing proteins that bind to the host genetic material and interfere with the bacterial genetic machinery . One such protein is called Ocr , which is produced by the bacteriophage T7 . Ocr is known to bind to the host restriction enzymes , which can cut DNA into small pieces to prevent viral DNA from being copied . However , Ocr can also bind to other proteins that are involved in the process of transcribing genetic information into RNA . Transcription is the process of making a copy of DNA into RNA , which is then used to make proteins . Ocr can potentially interfere with this process by blocking the binding of RNA polymerase , the enzyme that carries out transcription . The work presented here shows that Ocr can indeed interfere with transcription in Escherichia coli ( E . coli ) bacteria . The study also reveals the detailed structure of Ocr bound to RNAP . This structure suggests that Ocr could potentially be used to develop new antibiotics that target other proteins that are involved in transcription .
Microtubules are long, hollow structures that support the shape of cells and move proteins around them. They are essential for cells to grow and develop properly , and defects in microtubules can cause a number of diseases , including a rare brain disorder called H-ABC . H-ABC is characterized by the loss of myelin , which is a fatty substance that surrounds the axons of nerve cells , and the death of neurons in the brain . The exact cause of H-ABC is unknown , but it is thought to be caused by mutations in the gene TUBB4A . H-ABC is rare , and it is often caused by spontaneous mutations . However , some cases are caused by mutations in TUBB4A that are inherited from one’s parents . H-ABC can cause a range of symptoms , including abnormal walking , speech defects , impaired swallowing , and several cognitive defects . It can also cause a loss of neurons in the striatum and cerebellum , which are parts of the brain that are involved in movement and learning . Currently , there are no treatments available for H-ABC . However , researchers are developing mouse models of the disease to better understand its underlying causes and to develop new treatments . In this study , the researchers created a mouse model of H-ABC by breeding mice with a mutation in TUBB4A . The mice with this mutation had a range of symptoms , including tremors and difficulty walking , and they also had a loss of neurons in the striatum and cerebellum . The researchers also found that the mice with the mutation had fewer oligodendrocytes , which are cells that form the myelin sheath around nerve cells . Further studies showed that the mutation in TUBB4A affected the way that microtubules were organized in the nerve cells . The researchers propose that this mutation may lead to the loss of myelin and the death of neurons in the brain . The mouse model created by the researchers will be useful for studying H-ABC and developing new treatments for the disease .
Capillaries are tiny blood vessels that allow the exchange of oxygen and nutrients between the blood and tissues . The brain relies on a system called neurovascular coupling to detect the activity of neurons and trigger on-demand increases in blood flow to active regions of the brain . The recent discovery about capillaries in the brain reveals that capillaries in the brain are involved in detecting the activity of neurons and triggering on-demand increases in blood flow to active regions of the brain .
Spores are hardy and can survive extreme conditions , such as freezing temperatures . They are produced by many bacteria , including the bacteria that cause food poisoning . These bacteria can produce spores in response to adverse conditions , such as the presence of antibiotics . The process of producing spores is called sporulation . The spores are produced inside the cell and are enclosed in a protective layer of peptidoglycan , a tough protein . The spores are released when the cell divides and the mother cell engulfs the spore . The process of engulfment is poorly understood , but it is thought to involve the cell wall of the mother cell moving around the spore . Khanna et al . have now used a technique called cryo-electron tomography to visualize the process of sporulation in the bacterium Bacillus subtilis . The technique allows the researchers to see inside the cell at the nanoscale , and reveals new details about the structure of the bacterial cell wall . The images also reveal that the cell wall of the mother cell is not completely degraded during engulfment , but a thin layer of peptidoglycan persists . This layer of peptidoglycan acts as a barrier that prevents the mother cell from engulfing the spore completely . The images also show that the mother cell engulfs the spore by forming small finger-like projections that push against the spore . The projections are thought to be important for the mother cell to move around the spore and engulf it completely . Khanna et al . 's findings provide new insights into the process of sporulation . The new imaging technique used by Khanna et al . also provides a new way of visualizing biological processes .
Cells are like tiny factories that produce all the molecules needed for life . To do this , they must take in nutrients from their surroundings . The membrane surrounding each cell acts like a barrier , allowing some molecules to pass through while keeping others out . This is done by proteins embedded in the membrane . These proteins act as gatekeepers , and their job is to allow only certain molecules to pass through . Burtscher et al . have now measured the binding of a molecule called cocaine to a protein embedded in a membrane . The experiment was done using a technique called voltage-clamp recording . This involves applying a small electrical signal to the cell , and measuring the resulting current flowing through the membrane . The current is influenced by the binding of cocaine to the protein . This means that the electrical signal changes when cocaine binds to the protein . The experiment also showed that the binding of cocaine results in a change in the membrane capacitance . This is a measure of how much charge can be stored in the membrane . This discovery opens up new possibilities for measuring the binding of drugs to proteins embedded in the membrane . It could also help to understand how drugs interact with proteins embedded in the membrane , which is important for developing new drugs .
Mycobacterium tuberculosis , the bacterium that causes tuberculosis , is a major public health problem worldwide . It is estimated that one third of the world's population is infected with M . tuberculosis , and the bacterium kills 1. 5 million people every year . The bacterium is difficult to kill , and it spreads easily . The main cause of death by a single microbe worldwide is tuberculosis , which is caused by M . tuberculosis . The bacterium grows and spreads even when it does not have access to its preferred nitrogen sources , such as amino acids . M . tuberculosis can survive and spread even when it does not have access to its preferred nitrogen sources , such as amino acids . However , the bacterium is not able to use all nitrogen sources . This is a problem because M . tuberculosis is able to survive and spread even when it does not have access to its preferred nitrogen sources . Therefore , it is important to find ways to starve the bacteria and prevent its spread . Agapova et al . have now investigated how M . tuberculosis , the bacterium that causes tuberculosis , eats and survives . The experiments show that M . tuberculosis can consume nitrogen from amino acids . This is the first time that M . tuberculosis has been shown to be able to use amino acids as a nitrogen source . The results also reveal that M . tuberculosis can use all amino acids as a nitrogen source , but not necessarily utilise them as a sole nitrogen source . The findings suggest a new strategy to starve the bacteria and prevent its spread . This could be used to develop new strategies for treating tuberculosis .
Influenza viruses are constantly changing and evolving to escape the body's defenses . The influenza virus that circulates in humans in 2017-2018 is different from the one that circulated in 2016-2017 , and the same is true for each year . The influenza virus changes faster than the annual vaccines can keep up with . The vaccines are updated each year , and the updated vaccines are then used to protect people against influenza . However , the vaccines only protect people for about one year . Xue et al . have now studied the evolution of the influenza virus in people with weakened immune systems . The results of this study show that the influenza virus can change in a single person in some of the same ways that it has been seen to change around the world . This means that the influenza virus can change in a single person in a way that is similar to how it changes in people in different parts of the world . This study also shows that the influenza virus can change in a single person for many years . The next step in understanding how flu viruses evolve is to study the evolution of flu viruses in healthy people . This will help to understand how flu viruses change and predict how they might change in the future .
Infections of neurons are notoriously difficult to treat , as they are protected by the blood-brain barrier and often require the use of immunosuppressive drugs to prevent the immune system attacking the infected cells . One of the most common causes of these infections is the parasite Toxoplasma gondii , which can infect neurons in the brain and can cause a wide range of neurological diseases . Despite this , the mechanisms that underlie the infection of neurons by Toxoplasma are not well understood . To better understand how the parasite infects neurons , Mendez et al . used a mouse model of Toxoplasma infection . This model involved infecting mice with a strain of the parasite that expresses a protein that can be used to label the infected neurons . The experiments showed that Toxoplasma infected neurons were more common in certain regions of the brain , such as the cortex and the striatum , than in other areas . In addition , the experiments showed that neurons that were infected with the parasite had abnormal electrical activity compared to neurons that were not infected . These abnormalities were not seen in neurons that were near infected neurons but were not infected themselves . This suggests that the abnormal electrical activity seen in infected neurons is caused by direct interactions between the parasite and the infected neurons , rather than by changes in the immune response . Finally , the experiments showed that the infected neurons died over time , which suggests that the immune response to the parasite may be important in controlling the infection . Understanding how the immune system protects against infections is a key area of research in the field of immunology . By better understanding how the immune system works , scientists can develop new treatments for a range of diseases , including those caused by infections of neurons .
Sleep is a complex process that is not yet fully understood . The cholinergic system , which is responsible for the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine , has been linked to sleep . For example , it is known that cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain and brainstem support arousal and wakefulness , but the role of cholinergic neurons in promoting sleep is less well understood . Ni et al . now show that cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain project to the thalamus , and that light stimulation of these neurons in mice promotes sleep . The experiments also revealed that cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain release acetylcholine , which stimulates the thalamus to generate spindle oscillations . These oscillations are important for protecting sleep and for the transition from waking to sleep . Ni et al . also found that the release of acetylcholine from cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain can be blocked by a specific drug , and that this blockage prevents the promotion of sleep . These results suggest that the cholinergic system is important for promoting sleep , and that this role is mediated by the release of acetylcholine .
The main focus of modern agriculture is on monoculture, where only one type of crop is grown. This practice makes farming more efficient and profitable, but it also reduces biodiversity and can lead to nutrient depletion and soil degradation. The benefits of using biodiversity in agriculture are now well understood , but farmers have struggled to find ways to use it . To find out if crop and animal diversity can be used to improve agricultural practices , Li et al . conducted three experiments to compare rice paddies inhabited by either carp , mitten crabs or Chinese softshell turtles with fields where these organisms were not present . The results showed that the rice paddies with animals had less weeds , better crop yields , and steady levels of nitrogen in the soil . This is because the animals helped to reduce the amount of weeds and pests in the rice paddies , which resulted in better crop yields . The animals also helped to reduce the amount of fertilizers and pesticides used in the rice paddies , which is beneficial for the environment . These results suggest that introducing aquatic animals into rice paddies can increase the sustainability of rice production .
Dopamine neurons in the brain help the fly form long-term memories of odors that it associates with food rewards . However , the circuit that controls the formation of long-term memories remains unclear . Ichinose et al . now show that a recurrent circuit that involves a dopamine neuron called PAM-α1 and a neuron called MBON-α1 is required for the formation of long-term memories in the fruit fly . The circuit is named the PAM-α1 feedback circuit . The PAM-α1 feedback circuit is composed of PAM-α1 and MBON-α1 neurons and is recurrent , meaning that the neurons in the circuit send signals to each other repeatedly . This recurrent circuit is required for the formation of long-term memories in the fruit fly . Further studies are needed to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of long-term memories in the fruit fly .
The human cytomegalovirus ( HCMV ) is a common virus that can remain dormant in the body for many years . It is important to understand how the virus remains dormant in order to develop effective treatments to prevent the virus from reawakening . This is because HCMV reactivation from latency is associated with severe illness and mortality in transplant patients and those with weakened immune systems . Shnayder et al . analyzed the transcriptome of latently infected human monocytes , which are white blood cells that mature into macrophages . The analysis revealed that HCMV infection induces a gene signature that is associated with an immune response that is weaker than normal . This suggests that the virus suppresses the immune response in infected cells . Moreover , the analysis revealed that the viral gene signature is associated with the ability of the virus to reactivate . These findings suggest that the virus suppresses the immune response in latently infected cells , which may help it to remain dormant for long periods of time . Future work will be needed to understand how the virus suppresses the immune response in latently infected cells . This will help to develop effective treatments to prevent HCMV reactivation from latency .
Antibodies are proteins that fight microbes that cause disease . In people with autoimmune diseases , antibodies can also attack healthy tissues . In some autoimmune diseases , the antibodies attack tissues that are not healthy , but are not normally attacked by the immune system . For example , people with autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 ( APS1 ) develop autoantibodies that target proteins found in the ovaries , pancreas , and adrenal gland . These autoantibodies can cause ovarian insufficiency , pancreatic insufficiency , and adrenal insufficiency . People with APS1 also develop autoantibodies that target proteins found in the intestines . These autoantibodies can cause diarrhea and abnormal menstrual cycles . APS1 is caused by mutations in a gene called AIRE . This gene is important for the immune system . AIRE is expressed in many tissues throughout the body , and is especially important for the immune system . Mutations in AIRE can lead to a variety of autoimmune diseases . It is not clear how the immune system is able to target healthy tissues in people with APS1 . In this study , researchers investigated which proteins are targeted by antibodies in people with APS1 . The researchers used a technique called proteome-wide programmable phage-display ( PhIP-Seq ) to look for proteins that were targeted by antibodies in 67 people with APS1 . PhIP-Seq involves using phages to screen for proteins that are targeted by antibodies . The phages are engineered to bind to proteins in the blood . The phages are then screened for proteins that bind to the antibodies . The researchers identified 23 known autoantigens and 23 new autoantigens . Many of the new autoantigens were found to be expressed in the intestines , and may be involved in intestinal dysfunction . The researchers also identified an autoantigen that is targeted by antibodies in people with ovarian insufficiency . This autoantigen is a protein called KHDC3L , which is found in the oocytes ( or eggs ) of the ovaries . The researchers suggest that this autoantigen may be targeted by antibodies in people with APS1 because it is expressed in the oocytes . The researchers also found that 55% of people with APS1 had autoantibodies to another protein called RFX6 . This protein is also found in the intestines , and may also be involved in intestinal dysfunction . Overall , this study has identified new autoantigens that are targeted by antibodies in people with APS1 . These autoantigens may be important for developing new tests to diagnose autoimmune diseases and identify tissues at risk of damage .
Stem cells are cells that can develop into any type of cell in the body . They play a crucial role in the development of animals . Pluripotent stem cells have the ability to give rise to any cell type in the body . Mice and humans are the most well-known animals in which pluripotent stem cells have been found . However , there are other species of mammals , such as chickens and zebra finches , that are also capable of producing pluripotent stem cells . Pluripotent stem cells are typically found in the early embryos of mammals . The mechanism by which these stem cells are derived from the early embryo is not well understood . The pluripotency of stem cells is maintained by a group of proteins known as the pluripotency factors . These proteins are normally found in the embryo , and are responsible for the development of pluripotent stem cells . In the mouse , pluripotent stem cells can be derived from the early embryo . However , this process has not been demonstrated in other mammals . Zebra finches are a well-known bird species that is similar to the chicken in many ways . The pluripotency factors are normally found in the early embryos of zebra finches , and these birds are capable of producing pluripotent stem cells . However , it is not known whether the mechanism by which the pluripotency factors are produced in the early embryo of zebra finches is similar to that of mammals . In this study , the pluripotency factors were found in the early embryos of zebra finches . These birds were found to have a similar mechanism for producing pluripotent stem cells as that seen in mammals . This suggests that the pluripotency factors are produced in a similar way in birds and mammals . These findings suggest that the mechanism by which pluripotent stem cells are derived from the early embryo may be conserved in all mammals and birds .
Proteins , carbohydrates , and lipids are the main components of cells . Sphingolipids are a class of lipids that are important for the structure and function of cells . Sphingolipids play a role in the development of embryos and also in the immune system . In cells , sphingolipids are converted into other molecules . One of these molecules is called sphingosine-1-phosphate , which is important for the development of embryos . Mutations in the genes that encode enzymes involved in this process can cause defects in embryo development . However , it is not clear how cells sense changes in the levels of sphingolipids . Now , Mendelson et al . have found that cells can sense changes in the levels of sphingosine by a mechanism that involves the enzyme ceramide synthase . This enzyme is important for making ceramide from sphingosine . Mendelson et al . also found that in cells with a mutation in the gene that encodes ceramide synthase , sphingosine levels are higher than normal . This leads to defects in embryo development . However , these defects are only observed in cells that lack the ceramide synthase enzyme . This suggests that cells can sense changes in sphingolipid levels and that this sensing mechanism can help to regulate sphingolipid levels . In the future , these findings could be used to develop new treatments for diseases that are caused by changes in the levels of sphingolipids .
Ant colonies are superorganisms made up of individuals that work together to gather food and care for their young . Each ant colony is made up of different types of workers that perform different tasks . For example , some workers care for the young , while others go out to find food . To share resources and coordinate their work , ants use a system of chemical signals that are transmitted between individuals through a shared circulatory system . This circulatory system is made up of fluid that is shared between workers and is called trophallaxis . In the course of social evolution , related organisms have formed cooperative entities such as multicellular organisms or groups of social animals . In social insect societies , reproductive queens and males function as the germline , and workers as the soma . Similarly to different tissues in multicellular organisms , workers can be further specialized and exhibit division of labor across different behavioral and morphological castes . For example , young colonies have an initial growth phase where they solely produce one type of worker , and only later in their life cycle they may produce more specialized worker castes and finally , males and queens . Social insect colonies also go through life stages . Young colonies have an initial growth phase where they solely produce one type of worker , and only later in their life cycle they may produce more specialized worker castes and finally , males and queens . The switch to reproductive phase is a major life-history transition at the colony level , and connected to female caste determination . In social Hymenoptera , even the molecules traditionally functioning within-individuals can be shared among individuals . In ant colonies , for example , social isolation changes the composition of trophallactic fluid . To study the molecular functions of trophallactic fluid , the researchers analyzed the proteins present in the fluid of carpenter ants . The analysis showed that the proteins present in trophallactic fluid are filled with biomarkers reflecting biotic and abiotic conditions at both the colony and individual scale . The results show that trophallactic fluid proteomes are filled with biomarkers reflecting biotic and abiotic conditions at both the colony and individual scale . The results suggest that trophallactic fluid proteomes are filled with biomarkers reflecting biotic and abiotic conditions at both the colony and individual scale . The findings show that trophallactic fluid proteomes are filled with biomarkers reflecting biotic and abiotic conditions at both the colony and individual scale . The results suggest that trophallactic fluid proteomes are filled with biomarkers reflecting biotic and abiotic conditions at both the colony and individual scale . The findings suggest that the dynamic trophallactic fluid proteome has key functions in social physiology and life cycle of colonies .
In humans , holoprosencephaly is a condition where the forebrain and midface do not develop properly . This can lead to a range of health problems , including cerebral palsy , seizures , and blindness . Genetic mutations and exposure to alcohol in the womb are known to cause holoprosencephaly . However , the exact mechanisms by which these factors contribute to the condition are not yet fully understood . The study by Hong et al . investigated how exposure to alcohol in the womb affects the development of the brain and face in mice . The results showed that mice exposed to alcohol in the womb had a higher risk of developing holoprosencephaly . This effect was only seen when the mice had a mutation in a gene called Cdon . The study also found that exposure to alcohol in the womb reduced the activity of a signaling pathway called the Nodal pathway . This pathway is involved in the development of the brain and face , and is important for normal development of the midline of the embryo . The findings of Hong et al . suggest that exposure to alcohol in the womb may increase the risk of holoprosencephaly by disrupting the Nodal pathway . This may help to explain why holoprosencephaly is a common condition in humans . The findings may also help to identify new strategies to prevent holoprosencephaly in the future .
The main focus of the study conducted by Hwa et al. is on the relationship between alcohol use and stress. The researchers investigated how drinking alcohol daily for six weeks altered how the brain responded to stress. The study shows that long-term drinking disrupted the brain’s normal response to stress during protracted abstinence from alcohol. The researchers also identified a specific brain region that was responsible for these alterations in the brain’s response to stress. The findings suggest that there is a connection between alcohol use and stress, and could potentially lead to new treatments for alcoholism.
Red blood cells are responsible for carrying oxygen to all parts of an animal's body . They are produced in the bone marrow . This is a bone-filled cavity within the long bones of the arms and legs . The bone marrow of the earliest tetrapods ( animals with four limbs ) was thought to be closed , which would have prevented the production of red blood cells . However , a new study has found that the bone marrow of the earliest tetrapods was actually open , which allowed the production of red blood cells . The study also found that the earliest tetrapods were able to produce long bones like those of modern amphibians . This suggests that the evolution of red blood cell production occurred after the transition from aquatic to terrestrial environments .
A person who has lost a hand may still be able to feel sensations of their missing limb . This phenomenon is known as a phantom limb . However , it is not known how long after amputation the brain continues to represent individual fingers . Kikkert et al . used a technique called functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the brain’s representation of amputated limbs in two individuals who lost their left hand 25 and 31 years ago . The results suggest that the brain retains detailed information about individual fingers even after they have been amputated . This finding could help scientists to develop more sophisticated artificial limbs that can be controlled by the brain .
Insulin is a hormone that is produced by the pancreas and regulates the amount of sugar in the blood by promoting the uptake of glucose by cells . It is released from pancreatic cells when blood sugar levels rise . Insulin works by triggering the opening of KATP channels in the pancreatic cells . This allows the pancreatic cells to release insulin and increase blood sugar uptake . The KATP channels are complex structures that consist of four proteins called Kir6 and four proteins called SUR . The KATP channels are activated when the Kir6 and SUR proteins combine . The KATP channels are also known as ATP-dependent potassium channels because they are activated by ATP . The structure of the KATP channels is not fully understood . Lee et al . have now used cryo-electron microscopy to study the structure of KATP channels in pancreatic cells . Cryo-electron microscopy is a technique that can be used to determine the structure of proteins in cells . Lee et al . used this technique to study the structure of KATP channels in pancreatic cells . The experiments revealed that the KATP channels consist of two different forms . One form is called the quatrefoil form and the other is called the propeller form . The quatrefoil form is more common and has a ‘spoke-wheel’ structure . The propeller form is less common and has a ‘propeller’ structure . The quatrefoil form has a protein called SUR1 that binds to ATP . This causes the channel to close . The propeller form has a protein called SUR1 that binds to ADP . This causes the channel to open . The structure of the KATP channels is important because it helps scientists to understand how the pancreatic cells control the release of insulin . This could help to develop new drugs to treat conditions such as diabetes .
Most microbes communicate with each other through chemical messages that are exchanged between cells . Some of these chemical messages are produced by bacteria and yeast . The purpose of this communication is to allow the bacteria and yeast to adapt to their environments and survive . Garcia et al . studied how bacteria and yeast communicate by exchanging chemical messages . Garcia et al . discovered that bacteria and yeast communicate by sending a chemical message , which is lactic acid . Garcia et al . also showed that lactic acid can slow down or stop the growth of yeast . Garcia et al . believe that the communication between bacteria and yeast has been going on for hundreds of millions of years . Other microbes like fungi and viruses could also potentially communicate with each other . Further research is needed to find out how many other microbes communicate with each other .
Transcription factors are proteins that bind to DNA and activate or repress gene expression . The Shh gene is important for the development of the limb and is activated in a specific region of the developing limb called the ZPA . The Shh gene is regulated by a long-range enhancer called ZRS . The ZRS is a type of enhancer that exists in three different states in cells across the limb bud . The ZRS is normally inactive , but is activated in cells in the region of the ZPA . Peluso et al . studied the ZRS in cells from the limb bud and found that an enzyme called FGF is important for the activation of the ZRS . FGF binds to the ZRS and changes the state of the enhancer , making it active . The ZRS is also bound by a transcription factor called GABPα , which recruits a protein called p300 to the enhancer . Peluso et al . also found that the levels of another transcription factor called ETV4 change when the ZRS is activated . ETV4 normally keeps the ZRS in an inactive state . Peluso et al . show that the balance between transcription factors is necessary to activate the ZRS . The study by Peluso et al . reveals how the ZRS exists in three different states in cells across the limb bud . The study also shows that the balance between transcription factors is necessary for the activation of the ZRS and the correct pattern of Shh gene expression in the limb bud . This study contributes to our understanding of how specific genes are activated in a tissue-specific manner during development .
Understanding how different organisms develop and evolve is important to understand how genetic variation affects these processes . This is because genetic variation is the raw material for evolution . It is also important to understand how genetic variation affects the development of different organisms . For example , it is known that some genetic mutations can cause developmental problems . However , the extent to which genetic variation affects development is not well understood . Paaby et al . have now used a genetic technique called a ‘modifier screen’ to study how genetic variation affects the development of the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans . The experiments showed that genetic variation affects the development of worms in different ways . Some genetic variations caused the worms to die before they could hatch from their eggs . Other genetic variations caused the worms to survive and develop into adults . Paaby et al . also found that the genetic variations that caused the worms to survive and develop into adults were more likely to be caused by mutations that affect genes that are important for development . These findings suggest that genetic variation affects the development of different organisms in different ways .
CD4 T cells are a type of immune cell that help the body build immunity to infections caused by bacteria and viruses. CD4 T cells are important for vaccination because they recognize inactivated pathogens and can help the body build immunity to infections. Some CD4 T cells are able to recognize a specific protein called HBsAg , which is found on the surface of hepatitis B virus . In this study , Elias et al . tested the hypothesis that having preexisting memory CD4 T cells can help people develop quicker and stronger immunity to hepatitis B vaccine . The results showed that people with more preexisting memory CD4 T cells developed quicker and stronger immunity faster after vaccination against hepatitis B . This suggests that having preexisting memory CD4 T cells may help people develop quicker and stronger immunity after vaccination .
The immune system is the first line of defense against disease . It is the job of the immune system to recognize and eliminate invading pathogens . The immune system achieves this by recognizing specific proteins that are present on the surface of pathogens . This process is called immunodominance . Immunodominance is important for the immune system to recognize and eliminate specific pathogens . However , the mechanisms behind immunodominance are not well understood . Lo et al . investigated the role of immunodominance in the immune system . Lo et al . studied mice that had a single self-peptide presented on their immune cells . This self-peptide was called gp250 . The self-peptide was present on a protein called cytochrome c . The cytochrome c protein is a component of a pathogen called the bacterium . cytochrome c . The cytochrome c protein is also present in cells of the human body . Lo et al . found that the gp250 self-peptide skewed the selection of T-cells that recognized the cytochrome c protein . T-cells are a type of immune cell that recognizes proteins on the surface of pathogens . Lo et al . also found that the gp250 self-peptide skewed the selection of T-cells that recognized the cytochrome c protein . This means that the T-cells that were selected by the gp250 self-peptide were more likely to recognize the cytochrome c protein . Lo et al . also found that the T-cells that were selected by the gp250 self-peptide were more likely to recognize the cytochrome c protein . This is important for the immune system to recognize and eliminate specific pathogens . The next step for Lo et al . is to use this information to develop new vaccines .
The brain processes touch information from different types of sensory receptors in the skin . These receptors respond to different types of touch stimuli , such as pressure , vibration , or texture . The brain processes these different types of touch stimuli in different ways . For example , some receptors respond to high-frequency vibrations , while others respond to low-frequency vibrations . Saal et al . have now used computer models to understand how the brain combines information from different types of touch receptors . Saal et al . recorded electrical activity from neurons in the brain while monkeys were touched with different types of stimuli . The computer models showed that the brain processes touch information from different types of touch receptors in different ways . For example , the models showed that neurons in the brain responded differently to the same touch stimulus depending on the type of receptor that had triggered it . The models also showed that the brain processes information from different types of touch receptors in a way that preserves as much information as possible . This means that the brain uses the information from different types of touch receptors to make decisions about the nature of touch stimuli . These findings suggest that the brain uses information from multiple sensory receptors to make decisions about the nature of touch stimuli , and that this information is processed in a way that maximizes the information that is transmitted . Further research is needed to understand how the brain processes touch information .
Dengue fever is caused by the dengue virus and spread by mosquitoes . The virus can cause severe disease and death . There are four types of dengue virus , and people who have been infected with one of these types can develop immunity against future infections . Dengue is a major public health problem in the Asia-Pacific region . It is difficult to study dengue transmission because it is challenging to study dengue transmission because it is challenging to study dengue transmission because it is infrequent and difficult to predict . In 2013/14 , dengue fever spread across Fiji . Kucharski et al . collected blood samples from 160 people in Central Division of Fiji before the outbreak and then again after the outbreak . They found that children and teenagers between the ages of 10 and 19 had the greatest risk of infection during the outbreak . The blood samples revealed that children and teenagers between the ages of 10 and 19 had the greatest risk of infection during the outbreak . Kucharski et al . found that the clean-up efforts could explain the reduced dengue transmission during the outbreak . This suggests that clean-up efforts could be an effective way to reduce dengue transmission . Kucharski et al . also found that the blood samples revealed that children and teenagers between the ages of 10 and 19 had the greatest risk of infection during the outbreak . This suggests that children and teenagers are at higher risk of infection during dengue outbreaks . Further studies could look into why children and teenagers are at higher risk of infection during dengue outbreaks . The findings suggest that studying immunity against dengue could help health agencies to better understand how to control this disease and forecast future outbreaks .
Our brain and behavior are closely linked , and it is not fully understood how they interact . To help answer this question , researchers study the brain’s activity during various behaviors , and compare the patterns of activity to the brain’s activity when different behaviors are performed . These experiments generate large amounts of data , which scientists then use to infer the brain’s activity and behavior . However , the data generated from these experiments is often noisy and difficult to interpret , and scientists need to use statistical methods to infer the brain’s activity and behavior . One way to perform this statistical analysis is by using a computational tool called the likelihood approximation network ( LAN ) . This method allows researchers to estimate the brain’s activity and behavior using experimental data , even if the data is noisy or difficult to interpret . However , the computational cost of using the LAN is high , and scientists need to use large amounts of computational resources to perform the analysis . Fengler et al . have now developed a new method to perform the analysis using the LAN . The method is based on a computer network that can be trained to learn the likelihood of experimental data . The network can then be used to perform the analysis with much less computational cost . The results show that the new method is able to estimate the brain’s activity and behavior more accurately than the standard method . This could help scientists better understand how the brain and behavior are linked .
The tiny air sacs called alveoli in the lungs are responsible for exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide between the air we breathe and the blood in our body . The alveoli are surrounded by tiny blood vessels called capillaries . These capillaries come in close contact with the alveoli through tight junctions . The walls of the capillaries are made up of cells called endothelial cells . These cells play a vital role in the exchange of gases between the air and blood . The endothelial cells are tightly packed in the capillaries and line the alveoli . The cells are also responsible for making new capillaries in the lungs . Understanding how the endothelial cells work when the organ is both healthy and injured is important . Niethamer et al . used a technique called single-cell analytics to examine individual endothelial cells in the lungs of mice infected with influenza . This allowed Niethamer et al . to identify new subtypes of endothelial cells . Niethamer et al . found that one of these subtypes of cells called Car4-high ECs are particularly primed to receive orders from damaged alveoli . Niethamer et al . also found that the Car4-high ECs are enriched in the regenerating zones surrounding the most damaged regions of the lung following influenza- or bleomycin-induced lung injury . These findings provide new insights into how the lungs repair themselves . The discovery could also help to develop new therapies that target these cells to boost repair .
The lifespan of hermaphrodite worms is shortened when they mate with males . This is because the sperm released by the male worms can kill the female worms . In contrast , the lifespan of worms that do not mate with males is normal . Booth et al . have now found that young hermaphrodite worms are protected from the negative effects of mating with males . This protection is due to the presence of self-sperm . Self-sperm are sperm that are produced by the worms themselves . These sperm can detect when a female worm has received sperm from a male . When this happens , the self-sperm trigger a pathway that protects the worm from the negative effects of mating with males . The results suggest that animals may have evolved mechanisms to protect themselves from harm when mating .
The brain processes visual information to guide the behavior of animals . It is difficult to study the activity of neurons in the visual cortex of a primate because it is difficult to manipulate the DNA of the primate brain . Seidemann et al . have now overcome this challenge by developing a new technique that can selectively target a specific class of neurons in the primate visual cortex . The new technique allows the activity of the neurons to be closely monitored . Seidemann et al . used the technique to measure the activity of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the visual cortex of three macaque monkeys . The results of the study provide new insights into how the brain processes visual information . The new technique can be used to study the activity of neurons in the primate visual cortex in future experiments . Understanding the contribution of a particular cortical area to mental phenomena such as perception helps scientists understand how the brain processes visual information . Studying the activity of neurons in the primate visual cortex helps scientists understand how the brain processes visual information .
Cells are surrounded by a membrane that protects the cell and allows it to interact with its environment . This membrane is made up of a mixture of hydrophilic and hydrophobic molecules , with the hydrophobic molecules forming the core of the membrane . The hydrophobic core is made up of fats called lipids , and proteins that are embedded in the membrane . These proteins play a wide range of roles in the cell , including helping to transport molecules across the membrane , and helping to control the movement of molecules in and out of the cell . Despite their importance , the hydrophobic nature of the membrane makes it difficult to study membrane proteins . This is because they are embedded in a hydrophobic barrier surrounding cells , and it is difficult to stabilize these proteins without using detergents . Detergents are surfactants that can dissolve fats and proteins , and help to remove them from a membrane . However , they can also interfere with downstream biochemical analysis . For this reason , researchers have developed a number of methods to stabilize membrane proteins without using detergents . One of these methods is called a peptide-based method . This method uses a peptide to wrap around the hydrophobic parts of the membrane protein , shielding them from the watery solution . The peptide-based method is easy to use and has no detergent-related side effects . It is also simple to apply , and does not require the use of exogenous lipids . The peptide-based method is therefore a promising alternative to traditional methods .
DNA damage can lead to mutations and cancer . The DNA molecule contains four different nucleotides , which are the building blocks of DNA . DNA is made up of two strands of nucleotides , which are coiled together in a double helix . DNA can become damaged when the two strands are broken . DNA repair proteins can then repair the broken strands of DNA . DNA repair proteins can find the damaged strands of DNA by searching for complementary strands of DNA that match the damaged strands . DNA repair proteins can also repair damaged strands of DNA by swapping a piece of DNA from the damaged strand with a piece of DNA from a complementary strand . The RecA filament is a DNA repair protein that can repair damaged strands of DNA . The RecA filament can find the damaged strands of DNA by searching for complementary strands of DNA that match the damaged strands .
Our gaze follows the direction of the eyes of others . For instance , if we are talking to someone and they start looking at a specific object , we are likely to follow their gaze and look at the same object . Understanding how we direct our gaze to the same place as the other person's gaze is important for social interactions and for understanding social disorders . Previous studies on monkeys have shown that the brain processes information about the direction of a face in order to determine where to look . However , it was not clear if the brain processes information about the face orientation in the same way . In this study , two monkeys were shown a series of faces with their eyes directed towards different objects . The monkeys were then asked to follow the direction of the eyes of the face . The experiment showed that the monkeys followed the direction of the eyes , but only if the face was turned towards the same direction as the eyes . This suggests that the brain processes information about the face orientation in a similar way to information about the direction of the eyes . The brain regions involved in these processes were identified using magnetic resonance imaging . Further research is needed to understand how the brain processes information to perform gaze following . This information may help us understand social disorders .
The brain controls many aspects of behavior , including feeding behavior . Feeding behavior is a complex behavior that is not just about getting enough food to survive , but also involves the timing and amount of food that is eaten . In this study , Kanoski et al . investigated how the brain controls feeding behavior and how the brain processes the sensory cues that tell animals when to eat . The study found that ghrelin , a hormone that is secreted in the stomach when an animal is hungry , is released in the brain in anticipation of feeding . This increased the amount of food that the animals ate . The study also found that the brain processes the sensory cues that tell animals when to eat by using a network of neurons that connect different brain regions . The study also found that the neurons in the brain that respond to ghrelin also respond to another brain region called the lateral hypothalamus . This brain region controls feeding behavior in response to sensory cues . Together , the findings suggest that the brain processes the sensory cues that tell animals when to eat by using a network of neurons that connect different brain regions .
The eyes of moles and other underground mammals are often small and poorly developed. Many of these animals have lost their eyes over time, and this loss is thought to be linked to changes in the environment . Moles and other underground mammals live in dark tunnels that are often low in oxygen and high in carbon dioxide . This makes it difficult for them to see , and it may be an adaptation to help them survive . Partha et al . compared the genes of animals that live above ground with those that live underground . This showed that many genes involved in vision and the structure of the eye were more likely to change in underground animals . This suggests that these animals may have lost their eyes because the genes involved in their development were not under strong selective pressure . This is similar to the situation in blind cavefish , which have lost their eyes because the genes involved in their development are not under strong selective pressure . However , the study did not investigate why blind mole-rats have small eyes . This could be because the genes involved in their development are not under strong selective pressure , or it could be because blind mole-rats have another way of detecting their environment . The study also suggests that blind mole-rats may have lost their eyes because they have evolved to live in a low-oxygen environment . The genes involved in vision are under strong selective pressure in animals that live in high-oxygen environments . This means that blind mole-rats may have lost their eyes because they do not need to see in a low-oxygen environment . This is similar to the situation in blind cavefish , which have lost their eyes because they do not need to see in the water .
Signaling molecules are chemical messengers that control processes inside cells . Phosphorylation changes how active proteins are . Phosphatases are enzymes that remove phosphate groups from proteins . PP2B is a phosphatase that can be anchored to the membrane of cells by a protein called AKAP79 . AKAP79 is a large protein that contains many different binding sites for other proteins . Nygren et al . now show that AKAP79 binds to PP2B in a way that makes it more flexible . This flexibility allows PP2B to be anchored to different parts of the cell . This flexibility also means that PP2B is able to bind to different proteins and control different signaling pathways . Nygren et al . also show that PP2B is able to bind to a drug called cyclosporin . This interaction is important for controlling how PP2B works . PP2B is an important enzyme that is involved in many different processes in the body . Understanding how PP2B works could lead to the development of new drugs that have fewer side effects .
The loss of a hand can have a devastating impact on a person’s life . The brain of an individual who has lost a hand adapts to the loss by reorganizing the brain’s activity . Makin et al . investigated the brain of individuals who were born without a hand , and individuals who had lost their hand . The results show that the brain of individuals who were born without a hand adapts to the loss of that limb , and that this adaptation was reflected in patterns of brain activity . The study also shows that the brain of individuals who had lost their hand is adapted to the loss of that limb , and that this adaptation was reflected in patterns of brain activity . The study provides new insights into the brain and behavior following the loss of a hand . These findings could aid the development of rehabilitation techniques to help patients to optimise the use of both their residual and their intact limbs .
Understanding how cells divide is important for understanding how tissues grow and develop . In animals , cells divide in two separate parts , with one part growing into a new cell , while the other part becomes part of the mother cell . The spindle is a structure that forms at the center of the cell and divides the cell into two parts . The spindle is made up of long fibers called microtubules , which are anchored to the mother cell and to the new cell . As the cell divides , the spindle moves along the fibers to create a gap between the two parts of the cell . The spindle is pulled along the fibers by a motor called dynein . The spindle is also held in place by a group of proteins called Gα and GPR-1/2 . Gα proteins are found on the outside of the cell , while GPR-1/2 proteins are found on the inside of the cell . These proteins interact with each other and with the spindle to move it along the fibers . The Gα proteins are also involved in a cycle of chemical reactions that takes place in the cell . The cycle involves a protein called Gα and a molecule called GTP . When the cycle is complete , the Gα protein is released and the GTP molecule is broken down . It is not clear what role the Gα proteins play in moving the spindle along the fibers . In this study , the researchers used a technique called optogenetics to study the proteins involved in moving the spindle along the fibers . Optogenetics involves using a special light to control the activity of proteins in living cells . The researchers tagged the Gα , GPR-1/2 , and LIN-5 proteins with a light-sensitive protein called a photoreceptor . The photoreceptor was designed to interact with a protein called PH , which is found on the surface of the cell . When the light was turned on , the photoreceptor and PH proteins interacted and the Gα , GPR-1/2 , and LIN-5 proteins were pulled along the fibers . This showed that the Gα , GPR-1/2 , and LIN-5 proteins are all important for moving the spindle along the fibers . The researchers also found that a protein called RIC-8 is needed to release the Gα protein from the cell membrane . This suggests that RIC-8 plays a role in the cycle of chemical reactions that takes place in the cell . The results of this study show that the spindle is moved along the fibers by a group of proteins that are all important for cell division . Further studies will be needed to understand the role of RIC-8 in cell division .
Amblyopia is a common eye disorder that can be caused by squint or other eye problems. It causes the brain to ignore visual information from the affected eye and can be difficult to treat. The brain is most sensitive to visual information in the first few years of life , but it is less flexible in adults . Kaneko and Stryker have investigated whether it is possible to change this in adult mice . The mice were made to run on a treadmill while viewing a visual stimulus , which made their brain respond more strongly to visual information from their open eye . This led to a recovery of visual responses in the closed eye , which is a sign of improved vision . Kaneko and Stryker found that the recovery was specific to the stimulus presented during running . This suggests that the brain can change and adapt in adults , and that running may be a way to improve vision in adults with amblyopia .
Schiøtt and Boomsma wanted to find out how the ants and the fungus work together to break down leaf fragments. Schiøtt and Boomsma found that the ants provide the fungus with freshly cut leaf fragments for nutrition , while the fungus provides the ants with enzymes that help break down plant material . Schiøtt and Boomsma also found that the ants and the fungus jointly use a process called Fenton chemistry to break down plant material . This process involves hydrogen peroxide and iron atoms , which are abundant in the fecal fluid of the ants . Schiøtt and Boomsma suggest that this could be an efficient way to break down plant material . The findings could be applied in industries to improve the production of bioethanol , detergent , and food .
Gamble-George et al . have identified a new drug that could be used to treat posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD occurs after a traumatic event and is characterized by symptoms such as anxiety and depression . The new drug , called LM-4131 , reduces the activity of cells in the brain . This reduces the activity of cells in the brain that are involved in anxiety and depression . This makes the drug a potential new treatment for anxiety disorders .
Understanding how proteins work and how they interact with other molecules is important for many areas of biology . A protein’s structure is the key to understanding how it works . The structure of a protein is determined by the arrangement of its atoms , and it is often described as a three-dimensional model . Protein structures are typically determined using X-ray crystallography . This involves placing a protein in a crystal and then shining X-rays through the crystal . The X-rays are then used to determine the position of the atoms in the crystal . However , this method only provides information about the static shape of a protein . It does not reveal how the protein changes shape over time . Burnley et al . have now developed a new method that allows researchers to study how proteins change shape over time . This new method uses data from X-ray crystallography to generate a more realistic model of a protein . The method works by using computer programs to simulate the movement of the atoms in a protein . This allows researchers to study how the protein changes shape over time . The results of the simulation are then compared to the data collected by X-ray crystallography . Burnley et al . have tested the new method on 20 proteins . The results show that the method can provide more realistic models of proteins . The new method also reveals that proteins change shape over time . This information could help researchers understand how proteins work and how they interact with other molecules . In the future , the method could be applied to a majority of crystallography data to produce more realistic ensemble models of proteins .
