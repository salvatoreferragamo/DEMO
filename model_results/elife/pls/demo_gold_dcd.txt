Computational models are used to simulate and analyze complex systems such as the weather, pandemics, and biological processes. In biology, the cellular Potts model (CPM) is a well-established framework for simulating interacting cells. Although CPMs are relatively efficient models, tissue-scale simulations still require substantial computational resources . For this reason, all of the abovementioned frameworks rely on the C++ programming language for computation steps, which requires them to be built for and installed on the user’s native operating system . Here, we present ‘Artistoo’ ( Artificial Tissue Toolbox ) , a CPM framework built entirely in JavaScript . Although interpreted languages like JavaScript have classically been deemed too inefficient for running simulations , we found that this no longer holds: investments by major tech companies have tremendously improved JavaScript engines over the past years , to the point that our CPM now has no major performance disadvantage compared to existing C++ frameworks . The JavaScript implementation of Artistoo opens up new possibilities for rapid and low-barrier sharing of CPM simulations with students , collaborators , and readers or reviewers of a paper .
Older people have an increased risk of developing two conditions due to kidney disease: heart attacks or strokes. As people age, their kidneys become less able to repair themselves after an injury, which may contribute to the increased risk of these conditions. Scientists are interested in understanding why older kidneys are less able to repair themselves. One reason could be that older kidneys are more susceptible to excessive inflammation, which can damage kidney tissues. Macrophages are immune cells that trigger inflammation and can be harmful in excess. In the kidneys, macrophages are produced from two different sources: yolk-sac macrophages, which come from the yolk of an embryo, and hematopoietic stem cells, which come from the bone marrow. Yolk-sac macrophages are present in the kidneys from birth, but hematopoietic stem cells are only produced later in life. This means that older kidneys have a higher proportion of yolk-sac macrophages than younger kidneys. The experiments showed that one type of macrophage, called CX3CR1-lineage macrophages, is better at multiplying in older kidneys and eventually becomes the most common macrophage in older kidneys. This may explain the increased inflammation and reduced repair capacity seen in aging kidneys. Learning more about the processes that lead to kidney inflammation in older people could help scientists better understand age-related changes in susceptibility to kidney disease and may lead to better ways to prevent or treat their kidney disease.
The body has a system to get rid of waste products. This system is called the lymphatic system. It works like a network of vessels that carry waste products to the bloodstream, where they are removed from the body. The lymphatic system is also important for the immune system. It helps white blood cells, which fight infections, to move around the body. The brain is surrounded by a membrane called the dura mater. It is not clear if the lymphatic system is present in the dura mater. Absinta, Ha et al. used brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to study the lymphatic system in the dura mater of humans and monkeys. They found that the dura mater contains vessels that are similar to those found in the lymphatic system. These vessels were found to be present in humans and monkeys. This study suggests that the lymphatic system in the dura mater is present in mammals and has implications for understanding how the brain gets rid of waste products and how the immune system works.
Many organs, such as the lungs, kidneys, and breast, develop from branched tubes. The development of these organs is a complex process that involves the growth of branching tubes and the formation of individual organs from the tips of the branching tubes. However, the mechanisms that control the growth and development of these branching tubes are not well understood. A recent study suggested that the growth of these branching tubes stops when they impinge on neighboring branches, but Short et al. show that this is not the case in the kidneys. Instead, the branching tubes in the kidneys continue to grow and divide even when they are surrounded by nephrons, which are specialized structures that form near the tips of the branching tubes. This suggests that the mechanisms that control the growth and development of branching tubes in organs like the kidneys may be different from those in organs like the breast.
All living cells contain a large number of tiny structures called organelles , which carry out specific functions . These organelles are made of membranes that enclose a fluid inside the cell . When an organelle is damaged or the cell needs more nutrients , it can break down and recycle the damaged organelle or the fluid inside it . This process is called autophagy . Autophagy is a normal process that helps cells survive and maintain their health . However , it can also be abnormal and lead to diseases such as cancer . Autophagy works by forming structures called autophagosomes , which engulf damaged organelles or fluids inside the cell . The autophagosomes then fuse with other structures called lysosomes , which contain enzymes that break down the organelles . The process of autophagy is controlled by proteins that bind to the membranes of autophagosomes and lysosomes . These proteins are called guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) . When a GEF binds to the membrane of an autophagosome , it recruits another protein called Rab , which is involved in the fusion of the autophagosome with the lysosome . Once the autophagosome and the lysosome fuse , the lysosome can break down the organelle or the fluid inside the cell . Researchers are trying to understand how autophagy works and how it can be used to treat diseases . This knowledge could also help scientists to understand how the process of autophagy works in the body and how it can be used to develop new treatments for diseases .
Our genes are stored in DNA molecules that are packaged into a complex called chromatin. Chromatin is made up of proteins called histones that wrap around the DNA to form structures called nucleosomes . These nucleosomes are the building blocks of chromatin . The DNA is wrapped around the histones in a repeating pattern , which is known as the nucleosome periodicity . In all living organisms , including humans , nucleosomes are wrapped around the DNA in a similar way . The similarity in the way that nucleosomes are wrapped around DNA in archaea and eukaryotes suggests that the function of nucleosomes is the same in both types of organism . This function is thought to be to regulate the access of other proteins to the DNA . Archaea are a group of single-celled organisms that are found in a wide range of environments , including the human colon , marshlands , the ocean , and extreme environments such as hot springs and salt lakes . The study of Ammar et al . now shows that the nucleosome periodicity is conserved in archaea , suggesting that the function of nucleosomes is also conserved . This is important because it suggests that the fundamental role of chromatin in the regulation of gene expression is ancient .
We often make decisions based on multiple factors. For example, if we are choosing where to spend the afternoon with a friend, we may consider their opinion on cafés and movies. But how do we decide on the best option? It is possible that we consider all the options at once and then compare them. This is known as hierarchical decision-making. Another option is to make a decision about one factor, and then consider the other factors one after the other. This is known as serial decision-making. Researchers have now tested these two different approaches to decision-making in monkeys. The monkeys were shown a sequence of images and had to choose which of two images was brighter. The researchers found that the monkeys used a hierarchical approach to decision-making, and that they compared all the images at once. Zylberberg et al . then repeated the experiment with human volunteers. They found that, just like the monkeys, human volunteers also use a hierarchical approach to decision-making. This suggests that the brain is able to consider many options at once and compare them. However, the volunteers were not able to consider as many options as the monkeys. This suggests that there may be a limit to the number of options that the brain can consider at once. Further research will be needed to understand this limit and how the brain decides on the best option.
Fossil traces were first studied in the Grotta della Bàsura cave system since the 1950s. Virginia Chiappella published the first studies. The first studies documented bones from an extinct cave bear, human and animal footprints, charcoal from torches, finger marks, and lumps of clay stuck on the walls. Cutting-edge software and the latest technology were used in the recent analysis of the footprints. The trace fossils date back to about 14,000 years ago. The Stone Age humans descended at least 400 meters into the cave. The group consisted of two adults, an adolescent, and two children of about three and six years old. The findings suggest that young children were active group members during the late Stone Age, even when carrying out apparently dangerous activities.
In everyday life, we know that practice is essential for mastering a new movement or skill. For example, learning to play a musical instrument, ride a bike, or perform a surgical procedure requires a lot of practice. But what happens if a person is physically fatigued while practicing? Branscheidt et al . wanted to find out. They recruited healthy volunteers and asked them to learn a new motor skill while being physically fatigued. The results showed that learning in a fatigued state resulted in detrimental effects on overall task acquisition. The fatigue effects were persistent even after recovering from fatigue. Interestingly , learning a thinking task that required minimal force control was not affected by physical fatigue . These findings are important for people undergoing rehabilitation and professional individuals such as musicians, athletes, and surgeons who need to practice their skills to gain and maintain proficiency .
Our perception of space and number are closely connected. For example, when we look at a group of dots arranged in a particular order, we can easily estimate how many dots there are in the group. This ability to estimate the number of dots is called the ‘approximate number sense’. In the brain, the regions that deal with space and number are intertwined. For example, the part of the brain that processes space is also the part that processes numbers. This means that when we learn to count, the same neurons that originally represented space also become able to represent numbers. But how do these neurons work together to represent space and numbers? Answer: They share the same neurons, and the brain can reuse these neurons to process both space and numbers. This means that when we learn to count, the same neurons that originally represented space also become able to represent numbers. This is called ‘cortical recycling’.
Specialized cells constantly absorb and create new bone tissue, contributing to the regeneration process of the skeleton. Paget’s disease of bone is a disorder that causes misshapen and fragile bones, pain, fractures, neurological problems, hearing loss, and even cancer. Paget’s disease is clinically silent until it has reached an advanced stage, when irreversible damage to the skeleton has already occurred. The genetic analysis of over 200 patients with Paget’s disease revealed several chemical signatures that were significantly different in the DNA of PDB individuals compared to healthy counterparts. The research suggests that the environment may play a role in triggering PDB. Identifying these genetic changes may help identify patients before irreversible and debilitating damage occurs, allowing for early intervention or prevention. Future experiments should explore whether the identified genetic changes can be utilized to identify patients before irreversible damage and investigate possible treatments or preventive measures.
Bats rely on a technique called echolocation to navigate and hunt in the dark. They emit a high-pitched squeak and listen to the echoes that bounce back from objects in their environment. These echoes contain information about the size, shape and position of the objects around them. However , this information is not sufficient to build a detailed picture of the environment and the objects in it . Echolocation does not provide enough information to identify and localize specific objects in a particular place . So how do bats recognize the places they regularly visit while foraging and navigating ? One possible explanation is that bats use a 'template-based' approach to place recognition . Under this hypothesis , bats would recognize places by remembering their echo signature - rather than their 3D layout . The echo signature , or template , is a set of echoes that have a similar shape and size to each other . Bats would match the echoes they hear to the templates they have previously stored . The echoes that match the templates would be classified as one of the stored templates . The echoes that do not match any of the templates would be classified as a new template . The echoes that match the templates would be used to navigate to the place the bat had previously visited . The echoes that do not match any template would be used to navigate to a new place . Bats would use these echoes to build a map of the environment . The map would contain the echo templates that are associated with each place . This map would allow bats to recognize the places they regularly visit while foraging and navigating . Bats could use the echo templates to navigate to a specific place . The echo templates could also be used to build a cognitive map of the environment . A cognitive map is a mental map of the environment that integrates information about the environment . This would allow bats to find their way to a place they had not visited before . Bats have been shown to be able to remember flight routes in a completely dark room . This suggests that they could build a cognitive map . However , this ability to build a cognitive map is not the same as the ability to use echo templates to navigate . The next step would be to test whether bats can recognize echo templates in the wild . This would require a method to capture and store the echoes of natural scenes in a way that is biologically plausible . The echo templates could be used to build a cognitive map of the environment . This would allow bats to find their way to a place they had not visited before .
Proteins are the building blocks of cells and are produced by a process called protein synthesis. Protein synthesis starts with a messenger RNA molecule, which carries the instructions from the DNA to the ribosome. The ribosome reads the messenger RNA molecule and builds a protein from its sequence. However, sometimes the messenger RNA molecule can contain errors, which can result in the production of incorrect proteins that can potentially kill the cell. To prevent this, the cell's error-detecting system relies on the modification of a protein called SMG1 to spot and remove messenger RNA molecules containing errors. The specific pattern of amino acids that SMG1 recognizes on the UPF1 protein is a glutamine residue at the beginning and a leucine residue at the end. Langer et al. used cryo-electron microscopy to image human SMG1 bound to a segment of UPF1 and then generated the three-dimensional structure based on these images. The researchers replaced leucine, serine, and glutamine one-by-one with different amino acids to study their effect on the interaction between SMG1 and UPF1. They found that SMG1 prefers leucine at the beginning of the recognized pattern and glutamine at the end. This research provides molecular insights into a key step of the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway, which helps cells to remove incorrect proteins.
Living cells need to consider several factors to grow and multiply. One of these factors is its energy levels. For example , a cell needs to have enough energy to make new proteins and divide its DNA to make new cells . Another important factor is the availability of nutrients . For example , a cell needs a steady supply of sugars , amino acids and fatty acids to grow and divide . Cells also need to have the right balance of nutrients to divide properly . The mTOR protein is a key player in the growth and division of cells . It sits at the core of a signaling pathway that integrates information about energy levels and nutrient availability in a cell . MTOR is a master regulator of cellular growth . It controls metabolism and autophagy , and it also plays a role in the development of cancer . The mTOR protein is found in all living cells . The mTOR protein is made up of two different protein complexes . The first complex is called mTORC1 and is found in most cells . The second complex is called mTORC2 and is found in cells that need to grow and divide quickly . A new study has revealed the structure of the mTORC2 complex . The study used a technique called cryo-electron microscopy . The technique revealed the three-dimensional architecture of the human version of mTORC2 . The study found that the structure of mTORC2 is similar to that of mTORC1 . However , the accessory proteins in mTORC2 are organized differently from those in mTORC1 . The study also found that the accessory proteins in mTORC2 recognize different targets than those in mTORC1 . The study provides new insights into how the mTORC2 complex works . This knowledge may be useful for developing new drugs that target mTORC2 to treat diseases such as cancer .
Cancer cells grow and divide rapidly, but they also accumulate mutations in their DNA. The DNA damage response is an essential mechanism that helps to repair DNA mutations, but cancer cells often lose this ability. One of the key steps in the DNA damage response is a process called DNA repair, which involves the removal of DNA fragments. This process is normally carried out by proteins called helicases, which are like tiny motors that move along the DNA molecule and remove the damaged sections. The RecQ helicase family is one of the most well-known helicases in DNA repair. Leland et al . used a new technique to study how helicases work in DNA repair in live yeast cells . They found that when the RecQ helicase family is active, it removes DNA fragments at a much faster rate than other helicases . This means that the RecQ helicase family can repair DNA damage more quickly than other helicases . However , when the RecQ helicase family is not active , DNA damage can accumulate more quickly . This means that if the RecQ helicase family is inhibited , it could make cancer cells more resistant to DNA repair therapies that target DNA repair . In the future , Leland et al . hope to find ways to use this knowledge to make cancer cells more sensitive to DNA repair therapies .
The measles vaccine was introduced in the 1960s. However , measles remains a leading cause of death among children under five in Africa and Asia . In 2010 , the Indian government announced the addition of a second dose of measles vaccine through the routine immunization program . Wong et al . used data from the Million Death Study , a nationally representative survey of all deaths in India , including 27 , 000 deaths from 2005 to 2013 . Wong et al . found that measles deaths declined in India during 2005 to 2013 . The reduction in deaths was greater among girls than boys . The reduction in deaths was greatest among children aged 12–59 months , and the odds of death increased with age . Wong et al . estimated that 41 , 000 to 56 , 000 children’s lives were estimated to be saved by India’s measles immunization campaigns between 2010 and 2013 .
Tuberculosis ( TB ) disproportionately affects the Inuit , a group of indigenous people inhabiting the Arctic regions of Canada . To combat TB in the Inuit population , Canada aims to eliminate the disease by 2030 . Currently , DNA sequencing is used to identify genetic differences between TB bacteria in patients . However , this can miss genetic differences because people can be infected with more than one bacterium or because the bacterium can develop variations in its genome after infection . To overcome these limitations , researchers in Canada have now re-analyzed DNA sequencing data from a major TB outbreak in the Canadian North . The findings revealed that a single bacterium can harbor both genetic differences and develop variations in its genome after infection . This allowed researchers to identify a previously unrecognized super-spreading event , where one person likely transmitted TB to up to 17 others during the outbreak . This study highlights the importance of using deep sequencing to study TB transmission . It also suggests that deep sequencing may be useful for tracking the transmission of other infectious diseases .
Signaling systems control how an animal develops from a single cell into a complex organism by directing the development of tissues and organs through the switching on and off of genes. One of the most important signaling systems is called the Notch signaling system. It is involved in many aspects of animal development and is often altered in cancer. The Notch signaling system works by proteins on the surface of cells interacting with proteins inside other cells . The Notch signaling system controls the activity of genes by binding to DNA inside the cells . The Notch signaling system also controls the production of proteins that are essential for the development of tissues and organs . However , the Notch signaling system is not fully understood . The Notch signaling system controls the activity of genes by binding to proteins called receptors on the surface of cells . The Notch signaling system also controls the production of proteins that are essential for the development of tissues and organs . However , the Notch signaling system is not fully understood . To better understand how the Notch signaling system works , researchers have studied the proteins that interact with the receptors on the surface of cells . These proteins are called ligands . Ligands are made up of two parts: the extracellular part and the intracellular part . The extracellular part is the part that binds to the receptor on the surface of the cell . The intracellular part is the part that enters the cell and interacts with a protein inside the cell called the transcription factor . The Notch signaling system uses different ligands in different tissues . For example , the ligands that interact with the receptors on the surface of cells in the skin are different from those that interact with the receptors on the surface of cells in the brain . This means that the Notch signaling system must be able to recognize different ligands and respond differently to each one . The Notch signaling system also controls the activity of genes in different tissues . For example , the Notch signaling system controls the activity of genes that make the proteins that form bones . The Notch signaling system also controls the activity of genes that make proteins that form muscles . However , the Notch signaling system does not always respond in the same way to the same ligand in different tissues . This is because the ligands that interact with the receptors on the surface of cells in different tissues are different . For example , the ligands that interact with the receptors on the surface of cells in the skin are different from those that interact with the receptors on the surface of cells in the brain . This means that the Notch signaling system must be able to recognize different ligands and respond differently to each one . The Notch signaling system also controls the activity of genes in different tissues . For example , the Notch signaling system controls the activity of genes that make the proteins that form bones . The Notch signaling system also controls the activity of genes that make proteins that form muscles . However , the Notch signaling system does not always respond in the same way to the same ligand in different tissues . This is because the ligands that interact with the receptors on the surface of cells in different tissues are different . For example , the ligands that interact with the receptors on the surface of cells in the skin are different from those that interact with the receptors on the surface of cells in the brain . This means that the Notch signaling system must be able to recognize different ligands and respond differently to each one . The Notch signaling system is a complex system and is not fully understood . Future studies will help to reveal how the Notch signaling system works .
Bacteria are microorganisms that can cause infections in humans and animals . Antibiotics are drugs that can kill bacteria . However , some bacteria can develop ways to resist antibiotics , which makes it difficult to treat infections caused by these bacteria . Gram-negative bacteria are a type of bacteria that are naturally resistant to the antibiotic vancomycin . This is because they have a special membrane that prevents antibiotics from reaching the cell wall that surrounds the bacteria . However , scientists have found a new way that some Gram-negative bacteria can resist vancomycin . In this new way , the bacteria produce a molecule that is similar to vancomycin and can bind to the cell wall . This molecule is called ‘LPS*’ . The bacteria then use this molecule to block the entry of vancomycin into the cell wall . This means that the antibiotic cannot kill the bacteria . The discovery of the new way that Gram-negative bacteria can resist vancomycin could help scientists to develop new drugs that can treat infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria .
Cells release a variety of molecules to signal and influence other cells. These molecules are packaged into small structures called vesicles and then released from the cell. Once outside the cell, these vesicles can deliver their contents to other cells. The release process is a complex and highly coordinated process that involves many different molecules. One of the main components of this process is a molecule called GCC185. GCC185 is a protein that helps to prepare proteins for release from the cell. It does this by capturing vesicles and holding them close to the surface of the cell until they can be released. The exact mechanism by which GCC185 captures vesicles is not known. Here , Cheung et al . used a technique called atomic force microscopy to study the structure of GCC185. This revealed that GCC185 is not a rigid structure like a rod , as previously thought , but is more flexible . It also revealed that GCC185 has a central bubble that may collapse onto the surface of the cell to capture vesicles . These findings suggest that GCC185 may be able to capture vesicles by splaying its ends and collapsing onto the cell surface . Further experiments are needed to confirm this model .
Plants have roots that absorb water and nutrients from the soil to support their growth. The shape and size of a plant’s root system can change in response to environmental factors such as the amount of water available. Rellán-Álvarez et al . have now developed a system called GLO-Roots to study how the root system changes in response to environmental conditions in Arabidopsis thaliana , a plant species commonly used to study plant biology . This system uses a special type of light to allow the growth of roots in a controlled environment . The system also uses a computer program to analyze the roots and identify the different parts . This allowed Rellán-Álvarez et al . to study how the root system changes in response to water availability . This research may help scientists to better understand how plants respond to environmental factors and how these changes can be used to improve crop yields .
Proteins are the building blocks of all living cells and are essential for many cellular processes . The structure of a protein determines its function , so it is important to understand how proteins are controlled at a molecular level . Schmid and Hugel examined the structure of Hsp90 , a protein that exists in two different forms: a parallel structure and a V-shaped structure . The parallel structure is the most common form of Hsp90 and is associated with its ATPase activity . Hsp90 is a chaperone that breaks down ATP , the energy currency of the cell , and is also involved in many other cellular processes . The V-shaped structure is associated with a lack of ATPase activity . Schmid and Hugel found that Hsp90 can be controlled by three different factors: a point mutation in the protein , a co-chaperone binding to Hsp90 , and macro-molecular crowding . The point mutation destabilized the parallel structure of Hsp90 , while the co-chaperone binding stabilized it . Macro-molecular crowding , which occurs in the cell , also stabilized the parallel structure of Hsp90 . These results suggest that protein structure plays a key role in controlling the function of a protein . The findings of Schmid and Hugel also suggest that protein structure plays a key role in controlling the function of a protein . The results could have wider implications for medical diagnostics and treatment .
DNA contains instructions to make proteins necessary for the tasks carried out by cells. These instructions are copied into RNA molecules, which are then translated into proteins. Errors in DNA copying can lead to genetic mutations that affect the ability of a cell to carry out certain roles . However , it is not known how frequently errors in DNA copying occur . To address this question , Li et al . adapted a high-throughput sequencing method for RNA in Escherichia coli and other bacteria species . The experiments revealed that errors in RNA molecules occurred more frequently than genetic mutations in the same DNA sequence . Li et al . also found more nonsense errors at the end of the RNA molecule , resulting in prematurely stopped transcripts . The findings suggest that cells carry thousands of transcripts with inaccuracies in their sequence , which likely impact the tasks performed by the cells .
Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects around 10 million people worldwide. It is caused by the death of a type of cell called a neuron in the brain . The neurons affected in Parkinson's disease are those that produce a chemical called dopamine . Dopamine is responsible for transmitting signals from one neuron to another . When dopamine is not produced in sufficient quantities , the neurons that produce it die . This leads to a loss of motor control . People with Parkinson's disease may experience a range of symptoms including tremors , slow movement , and loss of balance . There are currently no effective treatments for Parkinson's disease , although some drugs can help to reduce the symptoms . A protein called PINK1 is known to play a role in the death of neurons in Parkinson's disease . PINK1 is a protein that is found in the mitochondria of cells . Mitochondria are structures within cells that are responsible for producing energy . PINK1 is thought to be involved in the process of removing damaged mitochondria from cells . It is also involved in a process called autophagy , which is the process by which cells recycle damaged parts of themselves . PINK1 is also known to be involved in a process called ubiquitin-proteasome pathway . In this process , proteins are marked with a molecule called ubiquitin and then broken down . PINK1 is also known to be involved in the process of Parkin activation . Parkin is a protein that is involved in the process of removing damaged mitochondria from cells . It is also involved in the process of autophagy . PINK1 is a difficult protein to study , as it is hard to make in the laboratory . However , a team of scientists have now used X-ray crystallography to study PINK1 . This is a technique that involves shining a beam of X-rays onto a sample and then measuring how the X-rays are scattered . The X-rays scatter when they hit atoms in the sample . The scattered X-rays can be used to build a detailed picture of the sample . The team of scientists used this technique to study PINK1 . They found that PINK1 has a unique structure . PINK1 has a C-terminal extension that is involved in the process of ubiquitin-proteasome pathway . PINK1 also has a unique structure that helps it to bind to ubiquitin . The team of scientists also found that mutations in PINK1 can lead to Parkinson's disease . The team of scientists also found that mutations in PINK1 can lead to Parkinson's disease . This is because the mutations disrupt the normal function of PINK1 . The mutations also affect the structure of PINK1 , making it harder for it to bind to ubiquitin . The team of scientists hope that their study will help to develop new treatments for Parkinson's disease .
Chemical signals called pheromones are used by animals to communicate with each other . Pheromones are released by one individual and detected by another , allowing them to recognize a potential mate . In moths , the female releases a chemical signal that is detected by males through their antennae . Males then use this information to recognize the female and to decide whether or not to mate with her . While we know a lot about how pheromones are produced and detected by moths , we still don't know how the specific chemical signals that moths use to communicate with each other evolved . Bastin-Héline et al . have now identified a new pheromone receptor in moths . The receptor is called SlitOR5 , and it detects a chemical signal that is produced by the female . The discovery of this new pheromone receptor has revealed that the evolution of pheromone signals and receptors can lead to the emergence of new species .
Our perception of what we see is influenced by our surroundings and the context in which we find ourselves . For example , if we are in a dimly lit room , we may perceive an object as being darker than it would be if we were in a brightly lit room . The brain's visual cortex is responsible for processing visual information , and it is influenced by the environment . However , the extent to which the visual cortex is affected by the environment is not clear . Pakan et al . used a technique called two-photon calcium imaging to study how movement affects neurons in the visual cortex of mice . The experiments revealed that some neurons in the visual cortex became more active when the mice were running on a treadmill , especially when they received visual stimulation . These findings suggest that the brain's visual cortex is influenced by the environment in which we are in , and that our perception of what we see is dependent on the context in which we see it .
Genes carry the instructions needed to build other molecules, including proteins . These instructions are stored in DNA , and are read by proteins called transcription factors . The instructions are read by transcription factors by recognizing a specific sequence of DNA . Transcription factors can recognize many different sequences of DNA , but they can only bind to one sequence at a time . To understand how transcription factors bind to DNA , Morgunova et al . studied four transcription factors that can bind to two different DNA sequences . The experiments showed that each of the transcription factors can bind to the two different DNA sequences with similar strength . This suggests that the DNA sequences are bound to the transcription factors with similar strength , but with different contributions from the strength of the interactions between the transcription factors and DNA . The results provide a new understanding of how transcription factors bind to DNA . The findings can also help to develop new treatments that depend on molecular binding and predicting the strength of interactions between molecules based on their structures .
Bacteria are a diverse group of microorganisms that can live in many different environments . Some bacteria are beneficial to humans , while others are harmful . Fermenting bacteria , for example , can produce harmful organic acids and alcohols . These harmful byproducts are released into the environment by the fermenting bacteria , which can harm other organisms and the environment . It is not clear how fermenting bacteria respond to toxins . Rosenthal et al . have now used microscopy to study the behavior of fermenting bacteria . This revealed that the cells of a common bacterium , Bacillus subtilis , can change their behavior in response to toxins . Some cells switched to a metabolic state that allowed them to produce and release harmful byproducts . Other cells switched to a metabolic state that allowed them to avoid producing harmful byproducts . These different metabolic states were not the result of genetic changes . Instead , they were triggered by the presence of toxins . This work reveals that fermenting bacteria can respond to toxins by switching between different metabolic states . This could be useful for developing new ways to harness bacterial metabolism .
Systemic light chain amyloidosis is a disease caused by overproduction of an immune protein , leading to the formation of amyloid fibrils that can result in organ failure and death . The excess protein chains exist in the body as individual molecules called 'monomers' or in pairs called 'dimers' . The amyloid fibrils are protein aggregates that are difficult to break down and often get deposited in the heart and kidneys , leading to organ failure . Discovering molecules that can prevent the formation of amyloid fibrils could be crucial in developing effective treatments for amyloidosis . Here , Brumshtein et al . screened a panel of 27 hydrophobic and aromatic ligands for their ability to prevent the formation of amyloid fibrils . Two of the ligands , methylene blue and sulfasalazine , were found to bind to the dimers of the protein and prevent the formation of amyloid fibrils . These two ligands are already approved for medical use . Further experiments revealed that methylene blue and sulfasalazine bind to the dimers in different ways , but both prevent the formation of amyloid fibrils . This suggests that the ability of ligands to bind to the dimers of the protein and prevent the formation of amyloid fibrils may be a common mechanism for preventing the formation of amyloid fibrils . The discovery of methylene blue and sulfasalazine as potential therapeutic agents for treating amyloidosis is an exciting development . Further research is needed to understand how these ligands prevent the formation of amyloid fibrils and to test their safety and efficacy in animal models of amyloidosis .
Genes are the instructions that cells use to make proteins . Mutations in genes can cause cells to make abnormal proteins . However , many cancer cells also have mutations in other genes that help control the instructions in genes . Grosso et al . investigated a set of genes that help control how the instructions in genes are used to make proteins . These genes are called epigenetic factors . Grosso et al . found that many cancer cells had mutations in epigenetic factors that caused them to make abnormal proteins . This led to Grosso et al . to investigate why cancer cells make abnormal proteins . Grosso et al . found that the mutations in epigenetic factors caused the instructions in genes to be read in the wrong order . This led to Grosso et al . to identify a new mechanism that cancer cells use to make abnormal proteins . Grosso et al . also found that this mechanism was associated with poorer patient survival . Grosso et al . also found that some cancer cells had mutations in genes that help control how the instructions in genes are used to make proteins . This led Grosso et al . to identify a new way that cancer cells can make abnormal proteins . These findings may help to develop new treatments for kidney cancer .
The kidneys are organs that filter waste out of the bloodstream to produce urine. The kidneys are made up of a large number of tiny structures called nephrons . Each nephron contains thousands of tiny filters called glomeruli . The glomeruli filter waste out of the bloodstream and into the urine . The number of nephrons is fixed at birth and does not increase throughout life . However , people with low numbers of nephrons have a higher risk of chronic kidney disease . Researchers have found that a group of proteins called R-spondins help to control how many nephrons are produced during development . R-spondins are released from the branching ureter , which is the tube that connects the kidneys to the bladder . They bind to other proteins called receptors , which are found on the surface of cells in the developing kidneys . When R-spondins bind to their receptors , they help to control the number of nephrons that are produced . However , it is not clear how R-spondins regulate nephron production . Now , Leclercq et al . – including members of the same team – have investigated how R-spondins control nephron production during kidney development . Leclercq et al . found that R-spondins are required to maintain the pool of nephron progenitors throughout development . This pool of cells is the source of nephrons . In addition , Leclercq et al . found that R-spondins help to control the differentiation of nephrons . Without R-spondins , nephrons fail to develop properly . The findings of Leclercq et al . provide new insights into the development of the kidneys and the role of R-spondins in this process . The results also highlight the importance of R-spondins in the development of nephrons . Further studies will be required to understand the role of R-spondins in kidney development and how they contribute to the development of kidney disease .
Cancer cells that have spread to the lymph nodes are more likely to survive long enough to form new tumors at distant sites . In some cases , cancer cells spread to the lymph nodes when they first leave the original tumor . However , how the cancer cells first enter the lymph nodes and then survive in this environment is not well understood . In this study , the researchers tracked the movement of melanoma cells to the lymph nodes of mice and found that the cancer cells first landed in a layer of cells that are part of the lymph nodes . These cells are known as macrophages and are important for helping the immune system fight infection . The researchers found that the cancer cells attached to these macrophages and this interaction helped the cancer cells to survive . The researchers then used a technique called gene editing to delete a gene that produces a protein called Siglec1 . This protein is found on the surface of the cancer cells and helps them to attach to the macrophages . The researchers found that deleting this gene reduced the ability of the cancer cells to survive in the lymph nodes . These findings suggest that cancer cells may use this interaction to survive in the lymph nodes . The researchers hope that this finding could help to develop new treatments that target this interaction to prevent cancer cells from spreading to the lymph nodes .
Sleep is an essential part of our daily routine , but scientists do not know why it is so important for the brain . Most previous studies have shown that sleep is important during early life , suggesting that sleep is important for the development of the brain . However , it has been difficult to study the effects of sleep during early brain development because most neurogenesis occurs in the womb . This means that it has been impossible to study the role of sleep during early brain development . To overcome this problem , Churgin et al . developed a new system to monitor the sleep patterns of fruit fly larvae . The larvae were placed in a special device that allowed the scientists to watch the larvae for hours at a time , and record how often they were active or inactive . Churgin et al . found that fruit fly larvae sleep during the second instar stage of development . The larvae also exhibited a specific posture that indicated that they were asleep . This posture was characterized by the larvae pulling their head back towards their body . When the larvae were deprived of sleep , they compensated by sleeping more afterward . This suggests that sleep is important for the development of the brain . Further experiments showed that sleep deprivation reduced the rate at which the larvae produced new neurons . This suggests that sleep is important for the development of the brain . The next step will be to study the role of sleep during early brain development in other animals , and to develop new methods to study sleep .
DNA is the molecule that stores the genetic information that is inherited from each parent and is found in every living cell . This information is stored in the sequence of four chemical bases ( A , C , G , and T ) that are arranged in a long sequence called a DNA molecule . In order for DNA molecules to be copied or replicated , a molecular machine called a helicase must first unwind the DNA molecule . This unwinding process allows the DNA molecule to be copied . However , the exact way that helicases unwind DNA molecules is still a topic of debate among researchers . In the current study , the researchers investigated the mechanism of unwinding DNA by helicases . They used a DNA molecule that was held in place by a biotin molecule and then added a helicase called G40P to the DNA . The DNA molecule was unwound one base pair at a time , and the researchers observed the movement of the helicase using a technique called single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) . The researchers found that G40P unwinds DNA by moving one base pair at a time . This movement is not a single stride , but rather a series of small steps . The researchers also found that G40P unwinds DNA faster when it binds to the DNA strand with a high affinity . The researchers suggest that this could be useful for developing new antibiotics to treat bacterial infections .
DNA is stored in every cell in the body, except in the mitochondria that power the cells . Mitochondrial DNA is a circular molecule that contains 37 genes that are responsible for the production of proteins needed to power the cell . The DNA is inherited from the mother , and this means that each person inherits the same mitochondrial DNA . However , sometimes a mutation in the mitochondrial DNA can occur , which can lead to a range of diseases . In many cases , these mutations are inherited from the mother . However , sometimes a mutation can occur spontaneously in the mitochondrial DNA . This can lead to a range of different effects , including the production of a defective mitochondrial DNA that can lead to disease . In order to understand how mutations in mitochondrial DNA occur , it is important to understand the processes that occur in the mitochondria . One of these processes is called recombination . Recombination is the process by which DNA is exchanged between two molecules . This process can lead to the production of new combinations of genes , which can lead to the production of new proteins that have new functions . Recombination is known to occur in a wide range of organisms , including bacteria , plants , and animals . However , it is not known whether it occurs in mitochondria . Now , Ma et al . show that recombination does occur in mitochondria . The experiments were performed on flies that had mutations in their mitochondrial DNA . When the flies were exposed to a process called restriction enzyme cutting , which breaks the DNA , the flies produced mutated mitochondrial DNA that contained genes from two different mitochondrial DNA molecules . The mutated mitochondrial DNA molecules were then passed on to the next generation . The experiments also showed that recombination can occur between mitochondrial DNA molecules of different species . This means that mitochondrial DNA from two different species can be exchanged , which could be important in understanding how mutations in mitochondrial DNA can occur . The results of the experiments also suggest that recombination in mitochondria is more common than previously thought . This means that mutations in mitochondrial DNA may be more common than previously thought . Further studies are needed to understand the effects of recombination on mitochondrial DNA and how it may be involved in the development of diseases .
The cells of all living organisms are made up of tiny structures called organelles that contain different types of molecules and perform different functions . For example , the cells of the human body contain a type of organelle called a lysosome that breaks down waste materials . Lysosomes are made up of a membrane that surrounds the organelle . The membrane is made up of a protein called Rab35 , and this protein is active only when it is bound to a molecule called GDP . The binding of GDP to Rab35 is controlled by the presence of a molecule called GTP , which is the opposite of GDP . When GTP is present , the Rab35 protein is active and helps to break down waste materials . When GDP is present , Rab35 is not active and cannot break down waste materials . The binding of GDP to Rab35 is also controlled by the presence of a molecule called GAP . GAPs are enzymes that remove GDP from Rab35 and replace it with GTP . Langemeyer et al . have now shown that the binding of GDP to Rab35 is controlled in a different way in different types of organelles . This means that different types of Rab35 proteins can be active in different organelles . This finding also shows that the binding of GDP to Rab35 is not controlled by a single mechanism . Instead , different mechanisms are used in different organelles . This shows that evolution is ongoing and that new ways of controlling the activity of proteins are being discovered .
Tuberculosis is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis . It is the leading cause of death from infectious disease worldwide . Tuberculosis is difficult to control because the bacteria that cause the disease can spread when an infected individual coughs or sneezes . The bacteria can also survive in the body of an infected individual for years before they develop symptoms . The disease is particularly susceptible to tuberculosis in people infected with HIV . The disease can also spread between people who are not infected with HIV . However , it is difficult to understand how the disease spreads on a large scale . Guerra-Assunção et al . have now used whole genome sequencing to study the spread of tuberculosis in a population in Malawi . The study was conducted over 15 years , and included data on 1700 patients . Guerra-Assunção et al . found that the different lineages of Mycobacterium tuberculosis differ in their ability to cause disease and spread between individuals . The proportion of cases of tuberculosis due to recent infection decreased over the period of the study . This suggests that the tuberculosis control programmes in Malawi have been successful in reducing the spread of the disease . The study also showed that the lineage of Mycobacterium tuberculosis that was most common in the population in 1991 has decreased in proportion . This suggests that the control programmes may have also been successful in reducing the proportion of cases of tuberculosis due to drug-resistant bacteria .
Our brain processes information about the world around us by grouping things together into categories . For example , we group animals into different categories like dogs , cats , and birds . Each category has a set of characteristics that define it . Our brain is able to group things into categories because of the structure of the world around us . For example , we can easily group animals into different categories because they have different characteristics . The structure of the world around us is organized into categories because we have evolved to be able to understand the world in this way . In this study , Luyckx et al . asked whether we can use the structure of the world to organize our thinking . The researchers asked 49 healthy volunteers to learn about 12 different stimuli , including images of donkeys and numbers . The stimuli were arranged in a way that some of them had a similar structure , such as donkeys and numbers . The volunteers were asked to rate the stimuli on a scale of 1 to 6 . The researchers then analyzed the brain activity of the volunteers while they were rating the stimuli . The analysis showed that the brain activity of the volunteers was organized around a structure that was similar to the structure of the stimuli . The researchers also showed that the brain activity of the volunteers was able to group stimuli into categories more efficiently when the stimuli had a similar structure . The findings suggest that the structure of the world is able to influence our thinking . This is because we can use the structure of the world to organize our thinking .
Alzheimer’s disease is a condition in which the brain is damaged by a protein called beta-amyloid . Beta-amyloid builds up in the brain , leading to memory loss and eventually to dementia . However , the reasons why beta-amyloid accumulates in the brain are not fully understood . One theory is that the brain may produce too much of the protein , which can lead to a condition called hyperactivity . This is a state in which the brain is overactive , and it is thought that this may be one of the early signs of Alzheimer’s disease . To test this theory , Mormino et al . studied a group of healthy older adults and found that those with more beta-amyloid in their brains were more likely to have increased activity in the hippocampus , a part of the brain that is involved in learning and memory . Mormino et al . also found that those with more hippocampal activity were more likely to show a decline in memory over time . The results suggest that hyperactivity in the hippocampus may be one of the earliest signs of Alzheimer’s disease . In the future , studies could investigate how reducing hippocampal activity can help to prevent Alzheimer’s disease .
Addictive drugs, particularly cocaine, can hijack the genetic mechanisms responsible for brain plasticity to drive dangerous, obsessive drug-seeking and consuming behaviors . This is because the brain can change its structure and function in response to new experiences and information from the environment . However , the impact of addictive drugs on brain plasticity is not yet fully understood . Now , Mukherjee et al . have taken an unbiased approach to the identification of the cellular and molecular modifications underlying the development of cocaine-elicited behaviors . The results reveal that cocaine induces changes in gene expression in multiple brain structures , including the striatum . The striatum is a brain region that plays a key role in drug addiction and is a major hub of cocaine-induced plasticity . Furthermore , Mukherjee et al . show that cocaine-induced changes in gene expression in the striatum are dependent on the history of cocaine exposure and are spatially organized . In particular , the cocaine-induced expression of a gene called Egr2 was shown to support cocaine seeking . These findings suggest that Egr2-expressing neurons in the striatum are important for cocaine addiction . Understanding how cocaine alters the brain can potentially pave the way for new treatments for cocaine addiction and provide insights into the basic mechanisms of brain plasticity .
The immune system is the body’s defense against infections and cancer . The immune system’s function is to constantly patrol the body and eliminate cancerous cells and harmful microbes . The immune system recognizes threats such as cancer cells by identifying certain signals at the surface of dangerous cells . Cancer cells often succeed in avoiding detection by the immune system by ‘hiding’ from it . To overcome this problem , researchers have developed drugs called chimeric antigen receptors ( CARs ) . CARs are synthetic transmembrane receptors that redirect T cells to target cancer cells . The CARs are designed to recognize specific proteins found on the surface of cancer cells . The CARs are engineered to bind to a specific protein on the surface of the cancer cell and then trigger an immune response . The drugs are designed to be administered to the patient through a drip or an injection . The CARs are also being used to develop new therapies for treating solid tumors . Solid tumors are made up of cancer cells that are embedded in the body’s tissue . However , the solid tumors are difficult to penetrate with drugs . To overcome this problem , researchers are investigating ways to deliver CARs to immune cells called macrophages . Macrophages are cells that can make their way inside tumors . Macrophages are able to recognize and attack the cancer cells inside the tumor . Morrissey , Williamson et al . have now developed a new type of CAR called CAR-P . The CAR-P is designed to recognize a protein called CD19 , which is found on the surface of cancer cells . The CAR-P is engineered to bind to CD19 and trigger an immune response . The CAR-P was tested in mice with breast cancer . The CAR-P was able to trigger an immune response that led to the death of cancer cells . The CAR-P was also able to trigger a process called engulfment , where macrophages eat the cancer cells . This process was found to be more effective than other methods of delivering CARs to macrophages . The next step is to test the CAR-P in human cancer cells .
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) is a serious condition that causes long-term inflammation and permanent damage to the airways in the lungs . Inflammation is caused by immune cells called neutrophils , which are a type of white blood cell . Neutrophils promote inflammation to aid the healing process , but they can also cause tissue damage and drive inflammatory diseases like COPD . Neutrophils are normally kept in check by a process called apoptosis , or programmed cell death . However , in COPD , neutrophils do not die as quickly as they should , leading to excessive inflammation . Rahman et al . found that blocking a group of proteins called ErbB kinases can help to reduce inflammation in mice with COPD . This is because ErbB kinases regulate the activity of genes that promote neutrophil survival . These findings suggest that drugs that target ErbB kinases could help to reduce inflammation in people with COPD .
Men currently have a life expectancy of 75 years in Europe, while women have a life expectancy of 82 years. This means that the average person in Europe is expected to live for 80 years by 2065. This is a 10-year increase from the current life expectancy of 70 years. This is a large increase and could have important implications for communities. For example, it could mean that there will be more older people in the population, which could bring both opportunities and challenges for healthcare planning and social security.
Ageing populations present challenges to healthcare systems and government finances. However, despite many years of research , there is still little understanding of what genetic factors influence how long a person will live and how it is influenced by disease . To investigate this , Timmers et al . studied the genetic makeup of 1 , 012 , 240 parents in the UK , whose lifespan ranged from 61 to 107 years . The researchers used a statistical method to determine which genetic variants were associated with a longer lifespan . This revealed 12 genetic regions that were associated with a longer lifespan . The study also found that genetic variants that increase the risk of developing diseases such as cancer , heart disease , and stroke were associated with a shorter lifespan . These findings suggest that genetic variants that affect how long a person lives can also affect how likely they are to develop disease . Further research is needed to understand how genetic variants influence how long a person will live and how it is influenced by disease .
DNA is packed into a cell in a way that allows the genetic information it carries to be read by the cell . However , how this is achieved is a mystery . One way that DNA is packed is by the formation of loops that connect different parts of the DNA . The H-NS protein helps to organize the DNA in bacteria . It is not clear how the H-NS protein works , but it is known that it can form loops in DNA . It is also known that the H-NS protein helps to control which genes are active . This is done by binding to specific parts of the DNA . Van der Valk et al . have now found that the H-NS protein can form loops in DNA by binding to one end of the DNA and then moving along the DNA to the other end . This is achieved by the H-NS protein forming a bridge between the two ends of the DNA . The bridge is made up of two copies of the H-NS protein . The H-NS protein also changes shape when it binds to DNA . This allows the H-NS protein to form a bridge between the two ends of the DNA . The H-NS protein also changes shape when it binds to other proteins . This helps to control which genes are active . Van der Valk et al . have also found that the H-NS protein can be inhibited by the presence of certain ions . This can also affect how the H-NS protein forms loops in DNA . Van der Valk et al . ‘s findings provide new insights into how the H-NS protein controls gene expression . The next step will be to determine how the H-NS protein controls gene expression in bacteria .
Vertebrates are animals with backbones. This means they have a similar body shape with a head at one end and left and right sides that are similar to each other . These animals include humans , birds , fish , and reptiles . In vertebrates , the backbone is made up of a series of bones that are connected by flexible joints . The bones are made up of cells that are able to divide and grow . The cells that make up the bones also have the ability to differentiate into other types of cells . This means that the cells can change into other types of cells as the bones grow . For example , some cells can become muscle cells , while others can become nerve cells . This is how the vertebrate backbone is able to move and respond to the environment . To study how vertebrates develop , scientists need to understand how the cells that make up the backbone differentiate and how the bones are formed . This is difficult to do in real vertebrates because they are living animals and cannot be easily studied in the laboratory . However , scientists have now found a way to study how vertebrates develop using a system of cells grown in a laboratory . These cells are called human induced pluripotent stem cells ( hPSCs ) . These cells can be grown into many different types of cells , including those that form the vertebrate backbone . By studying the hPSCs , scientists hope to understand how the vertebrate backbone is formed . This will help scientists understand how vertebrates develop , and could help to treat diseases that affect the backbone .
One of the main roles of T cells is to coordinate the immune response and kill cells infected with viruses. In addition to T cells, another important component of the immune response is antibodies . Antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system that recognize viruses and trigger the immune response . In 202 , the COVID-19 pandemic was caused by a virus known as SARS-CoV-2 . As a result of the pandemic , many people developed severe COVID-19 . The virus causes severe symptoms in some people , such as pneumonia and inflammation in the lungs . This can be life-threatening . In order to reduce the number of severe cases of COVID-19 , it is important to develop a vaccine that can protect people from infection . To date , several vaccines have been developed that can protect people from severe COVID-19 . The vaccines work by inducing the immune system to produce antibodies and T cells that can recognize the virus and kill infected cells . Neidleman et al . wanted to learn more about how T cells respond to vaccines and how they can be improved . Neidleman et al . analyzed the immune cells of people who had never had COVID-19 before . These individuals were given two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna mRNA vaccine . The first dose was effective in inducing T cells that could recognize the virus . However , the second dose did not induce as many T cells as the first dose . Neidleman et al . then analyzed the immune cells of people who had recovered from COVID-19 . These individuals had previously been infected with the virus , and their immune cells had been trained to recognize the virus . Neidleman et al . found that the second dose of the vaccine was not as effective in inducing T cells in people who had recovered from COVID-19 . In addition , Neidleman et al . found that the T cells of people who had recovered from COVID-19 were different from those of people who had never had COVID-19 . These differences could be important for understanding how the immune system responds to vaccines . Neidleman et al . also found that the T cells of people who had recovered from COVID-19 were more long-lived , and they could migrate out of the blood and into the lungs . This is important because the lungs are the site where the virus first infects people . Overall , Neidleman et al . found that the second dose of the vaccine can improve the quality and quantity of T cells and enhance overall protection against severe COVID-19 . This may be important for people who have already recovered from COVID-19 .
Cancer develops when cells divide and grow without control. The main cause of cancer development is the rapid and uncontrolled division of cells in the body. Cancer cells may spread to other parts of the body and become life-threatening. Most anti-cancer treatments aim to reduce the multiplication of cancer cells, but not their ability to migrate. However , cancer cells can also move by themselves in order to spread to other parts of the body . This process is called invasion . It is not clear which signal protein stimulates human cells to grow and move around . The Ras signal protein is a well-known cancer-causing gene that can cause cancer to spread . It is not clear how Ras activates its signaling pathway . Zago et al . developed a new technique to precisely study the signaling pathways in human cells . This technique used light to activate a signaling protein called RalB , which is involved in the spread of cancer cells . Zago et al . found that RalB was needed for human cancer cells to move and invade other parts of the body . Further experiments showed that RalB was activated by Ras in human cancer cells . This result suggests that inhibiting the activity of RalB may be a promising new strategy to treat cancer .
Congenital heart disease ( CHD ) is the most common birth defect . It affects approximately 1 in 100 children and is caused by changes in the development of the heart . Some mothers develop diabetes during pregnancy , which increases the risk of CHD . Researchers are working to understand why diabetes causes CHD . Now , Nakano et al . show that high levels of glucose in the mother’s blood during pregnancy can affect the development of the heart . Nakano et al . used stem cells to study how glucose affects the development of the heart . The results revealed that high levels of glucose in the mother’s blood can cause the heart to develop in an abnormal way . In particular , the cells that form the heart are more likely to divide and divide more quickly . However , the heart cells do not mature as quickly as they should . Nakano et al . also used mice to study the effects of glucose in the mother’s blood on the development of the heart . The results showed that the hearts of the mice were more likely to develop in an abnormal way if their mothers had diabetes . The study by Nakano et al . provides important insights into how high levels of glucose in the mother’s blood can affect the development of the heart . This knowledge could help develop new treatments for CHD in children of diabetic mothers .
Polymerase II ( Pol II ) is the enzyme that carries out transcription , which is the process of copying the genetic information in DNA into messenger RNA molecules that can then be translated into proteins . The activity of Pol II is regulated by a process called transcriptional pausing , which is important for controlling how much of a particular protein is made . However , the molecules that regulate transcriptional pausing in higher organisms such as mammals are not yet fully understood . JMJD6 is a protein that has been found to be involved in transcriptional pausing in frog embryos . It is known to bind to RNA molecules , and it is also known to contain an enzyme called a protease that can cut proteins . However , the enzyme that JMJD6 uses to cut proteins is not known . The current study shows that JMJD6 can cut a protein called MePCE , which is part of the 7SK snRNP complex that is involved in transcriptional pausing . The current study also shows that when JMJD6 cuts MePCE , it helps to release a protein complex called P-TEFb , which is needed to activate Pol II . These findings suggest that JMJD6 is involved in regulating transcriptional pausing in higher organisms . Understanding the role of JMJD6 may help identify new avenues for cancer drug development .
Stem cells are special cells that can grow into different types of cells . They are found in bone marrow , and they play a crucial role in keeping the body healthy . In many cases , the stem cells are unable to produce the right number of cells , which can lead to a condition called myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) . MDS is a common type of blood cancer in the elderly . It occurs when the stem cells in the bone marrow fail to develop properly , resulting in a shortage of red blood cells , white blood cells and platelets . The genes responsible for the normal development of stem cells are known as the genes of hematopoietic stem cells ( HSC ) . A common genetic change in MDS patients is a loss of one copy of chromosome 7 , which is known as a monosomy 7 . However , the effects of this loss of a chromosome 7 on the stem cells in the bone marrow are not well understood . To investigate this , mice with a genetic alteration that mimics the loss of a chromosome 7 were studied . The mice were genetically engineered to delete a segment of chromosome 5A3 . This deletion was found to disrupt the normal development of stem cells in the bone marrow . The stem cells in the bone marrow of these mice were unable to produce enough red blood cells , white blood cells and platelets . The mice also had an increased number of stem cells that were immature and unable to mature into normal cells . The experiments also showed that the mice had a higher risk of developing MDS . The results suggest that the loss of a chromosome 7 can disrupt the normal development of stem cells in the bone marrow . This could help to explain why MDS is a common condition in older people .
Malaria is caused by a parasite called Plasmodium falciparum . Artemisinin is a drug that is effective in treating malaria caused by P . falciparum . However , resistance to artemisinin has developed in some parts of the world . This has led to the World Health Organization recommending that artemisinin is used in combination with other drugs to treat malaria . Artemisinin is effective against the parasite but it is not effective against the parasite’s ability to divide . A mutation in the pfk13 gene can lead to resistance to artemisinin . The pfk13 gene is found in the genome of P . falciparum . This gene encodes a protein called pfk13 , which is found on the surface of the parasite . The pfk13 protein is important for the parasite to divide . The pfk13 protein is made of two parts: the propeller domain and the stalk . The pfk13 propeller domain is made up of a propeller-like structure . The pfk13 stalk is made up of a long sequence of amino acids . Mutations in the propeller domain of the pfk13 gene are known to cause resistance to artemisinin . A mutation in the pfk13 stalk can also cause resistance to artemisinin . In 2010 , a mutation in the pfk13 propeller domain was detected in Guyana . This mutation is known as the pfk13 C580Y mutation . The pfk13 C580Y mutation is found in some parts of the world . However , it has not yet been detected in South America . In this study , the researchers genotyped 854 samples collected from Guyana in 2016–2017 . The researchers found that 1 . 6% of the samples carried the pfk13 C580Y mutation . The researchers also found that the pfk13 C580Y mutation was present in one clonal lineage of P . falciparum parasites in Guyana . The researchers also found that the pfk13 C580Y mutation caused parasites to divide more slowly in culture . These results suggest that the pfk13 C580Y mutation is present in Guyana and that it is associated with a lower fitness of the parasite . This mutation may therefore limit the spread of this mutation in Guyana .
Proteins are responsible for almost every process that keeps cells alive . To understand how proteins move and interact within a living cell , scientists use a technique called single-particle tracking . This involves labeling the proteins of interest with a small dye molecule that produces light when excited by a laser . The proteins are then imaged using a microscope . The technique is very useful for studying the dynamics of proteins , but it has some limitations . For example , the images can be blurred , and the technique can be biased against proteins that move quickly . To overcome these challenges , scientists have developed new techniques to analyze the data collected using single-particle tracking . One such technique is called Spot-On , which is now freely available to researchers . Spot-On allows scientists to analyze the data using a software package that is designed to be easy to use . It also provides a free and user-friendly way to analyze the data . The software package can also be used to correct for biases that occur during the experiment . This is important since some biases can lead to incorrect conclusions if not corrected for . The software package can also be used to analyze data from experiments that use different experimental settings . For example , Spot-On can be used to analyze data from experiments that use different laser settings . The software package can also be used to analyze data from experiments that use different types of dye molecules . Overall , Spot-On is a useful tool for analyzing single-particle tracking data . It is freely available to researchers , and it provides a way to correct for biases that occur during experiments .
Alexander disease is a rare and invariably fatal neurological disorder that affects infants and young children . It is caused by a mutation in a gene that is important for the structure of astrocytes , which are cells in the brain that support neurons . Astrocytes contain a protein called glial fibrillary acidic protein ( GFAP ) , which is the main component of the intermediate filament ( IF ) cytoskeleton in astrocytes . Mutations in GFAP are associated with defective filament organization , which can lead to a loss of neurons . This can result in seizures , loss of motor skills , and eventually death . Alexander disease is usually diagnosed by examining brain tissue from patients . However , it is difficult to diagnose Alexander disease with certainty because of the lack of available treatments . Now , Omary et al . have identified a new protein that is associated with the most severe form of Alexander disease . This protein , called caspase-6 , is produced by astrocytes and is important for their ability to respond to stress . Omary et al . have found that caspase-6 is selectively produced in the most severe form of Alexander disease , which affects young children . Caspase-6 is also found in the brain tissue of patients who died very young . This suggests that the protein is involved in the development of Alexander disease . Omary et al . have also found that the most severe form of Alexander disease is associated with abnormal phosphorylation of GFAP . This phosphorylation can lead to the protein accumulating in the cytoplasm of astrocytes . This accumulation can disrupt the normal structure of the astrocyte and may contribute to the development of Alexander disease . Further studies will be required to understand the role of caspase-6 and GFAP phosphorylation in Alexander disease .
Malaria is a disease that kills over 400,000 people each year. It is caused by a parasite that is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes . There are many ways that people can be infected with malaria , including through the bite of an infected mosquito , through blood transfusions , and from their mothers during pregnancy . Malaria is a major health problem in tropical and subtropical regions of the world . The World Health Organization has set a goal to reduce the number of malaria cases to 50 , 000 or fewer by 2030 . The best way to achieve this goal is to develop a malaria vaccine that can prevent the disease . Researchers are currently working on developing a malaria vaccine that targets the parasite’s protein called circumsporozoite protein ( CSP ) . A vaccine that targets CSP could prevent the parasite from infecting people , which would reduce the number of malaria cases . However , developing a vaccine that is effective against malaria is a challenging task . The parasite’s CSP protein is very similar to other proteins that are found in the human body , and it is difficult to distinguish it from these other proteins . This makes it hard to design a vaccine that targets CSP without also triggering an immune response against other proteins . To develop a malaria vaccine , researchers need to understand how the parasite’s CSP protein is recognized by the human immune system . The immune system uses antibodies to recognize and fight off infections . Antibodies are proteins that are produced by immune cells in response to an infection . Antibodies are like tiny molecular hooks that can latch onto proteins and prevent them from interacting with other proteins in the body . Antibodies can also trigger an immune response by triggering a cascade of chemical reactions that activate other immune cells . The immune system recognizes CSP by using antibodies that bind to a specific region of the protein . The region that the antibodies bind to is called the central repeat . The central repeat is a series of repeating sequences of amino acids that are found in the CSP protein . Antibodies that bind to the central repeat are known as repeat-targeting antibodies . Repeat-targeting antibodies are more effective at preventing malaria than other types of antibodies . The central repeat region of the CSP protein is similar in mice and humans , which makes it easier to study the structure of the CSP protein in mice . To learn more about how the immune system recognizes the central repeat of the CSP protein , researchers studied the structure of the CSP protein in mice . This showed that the CSP protein has a spiral-like structure when bound by antibodies . This is similar to the spiral-like structure that is seen when human antibodies bind to the central repeat of CSP . This is an important discovery because it suggests that the immune system has evolved similar mechanisms to detect and inhibit the parasite’s CSP protein in mice and humans . The findings about the molecular connections between 3D11 and CSP suggest that the immune response against malaria is more similar in mice and humans than previously thought . This knowledge will help researchers design more effective vaccines against malaria .
In typical microscope lenses , the images captured show a compromise between the level of detail in the image and how much of a sample can be shown . McConnell et al . have now developed a new microscope lens , the Mesolens , which can magnify samples by up to four times in much higher detail than conventional lenses that produce the same magnification . The Mesolens was tested as part of laser scanning confocal microscopy , a technique that can reconstruct the three-dimensional structure of a sample by collecting images from different layers . The images captured using the Mesolens allowed researchers to distinguish individual cells in cultures of rat brain cells . The images also allowed researchers to track the distribution of cells in developing organs such as the heart . The Mesolens has the potential to be used in many different applications and could assist in the study of many biological processes .
Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria and hijack their cellular machinery to replicate their genetic material . The bacteriophage T7 infects Escherichia coli and hijacks the host cellular machinery to replicate its genetic material . The T7 genome encodes 56 proteins , including a protein called Ocr that binds to the host transcriptional machinery . Ocr is the first protein to be produced after infection , and it is abundantly expressed and forms a dimer that mimics the structure of a slightly bent 20 base pair B-form DNA . The binding of Ocr to the host transcriptional machinery is a key mechanism that allows T7 to control the transcription of the host genes . However , the details of how Ocr interacts with the host transcriptional machinery are not known . Here , Ye et al . used cryo-electron microscopy to show how Ocr binds to the host transcriptional machinery . The binding of Ocr to the host transcriptional machinery is the first step in controlling the transcription of the host genes . This discovery could lead to the development of new antibiotics against bacterial infections .
Microtubules help support the shape of the cell and move proteins to their required locations. Defects in microtubules can lead to disease. Mutations in the gene encoding a protein called TUBB4A cause a rare brain disorder called H-ABC (Hypomyelination with Atrophy of Basal Ganglia and Cerebellum). H-ABC is characterized by progressive loss of motor skills , swallowing difficulties , and impaired speech . H-ABC is caused by mutations in the TUBB4A gene , which is encoded by a protein called TUBB4A . The role of TUBB4A is to help form microtubules . Mutations in the TUBB4A gene are found in about 1 in 20 people , and most of these mutations occur spontaneously . The gene is also mutated in some forms of leukodystrophy , which is a group of genetic disorders that affect the brain . There are no animal models for the TUBB4A gene mutations associated with H-ABC . Sase , Almad et al . developed a mouse model of H-ABC by generating mice that carried a mutated version of the TUBB4A gene . The mice were bred to carry a mutation in the TUBB4A gene . The mice showed a range of physical symptoms , including abnormal walking gait , poor coordination , twitching , and reduced reflexes . The cerebellum and striatum of the mice were smaller compared to mice with a normal version of the TUBB4A gene . The mice also had fewer neurons in their cerebellum and striatum compared to mice with a normal version of the TUBB4A gene . The mice also had fewer oligodendrocytes , which are cells that help form myelin , a fatty layer that insulates nerve fibers . In addition , the myelin sheaths on nerve fibers were thinner than normal . This suggests that the mice had a deficit in myelin formation . The mice also showed abnormalities in the structure of microtubules . Further studies are needed to understand the effect of TUBB4A mutations on the structure of microtubules and how this leads to the symptoms of H-ABC . The mouse model developed by Sase , Almad et al . shares many features of H-ABC disease in humans , providing a valuable tool for studying the disease and developing potential therapies .
Brain cells need to get rid of waste products and they also need to keep themselves supplied with oxygen and nutrients . The blood vessels in the brain are able to control the amount of blood flowing through them by opening and closing the tiny barriers between the blood vessels . When a brain cell needs more oxygen and nutrients , it sends a signal to the blood vessel barrier to open up and allow more blood to flow through . This process is called neurovascular coupling . In the brain , the barrier is made up of cells called endothelial cells . These cells line the inside of the blood vessels and are able to sense when they need to open up and allow more blood to flow through . When a brain cell needs more oxygen and nutrients , it releases a chemical called potassium into the bloodstream . This chemical then triggers the endothelial cells to open up and allow more blood to flow through . A protein called Kir2.1 is involved in this process . It helps to open up the barrier by releasing potassium ions into the bloodstream . However , the activity of the Kir2.1 protein is regulated by a protein called PIP2 . PIP2 is a molecule that helps to control the activity of other proteins . When PIP2 levels are low , the activity of the Kir2.1 protein is also low . However , when PIP2 levels are high , the activity of the Kir2.1 protein is also high . This suggests that PIP2 helps to control the activity of the Kir2.1 protein . PIP2 is also involved in other processes in the body , including controlling the activity of proteins that help to regulate blood pressure and heart rate . PIP2 is also involved in the release of chemicals that are involved in pain and inflammation . In the brain , PIP2 is able to regulate the activity of the Kir2.1 protein by controlling the levels of other proteins that are involved in the process of neurovascular coupling . This is important because it allows the brain to control the amount of blood flowing through the blood vessels . In the future , it may be possible to develop drugs that can either increase or decrease the activity of the Kir2.1 protein . These drugs could help to treat a range of conditions that are related to changes in blood flow in the brain , such as stroke , epilepsy and Alzheimer's disease .
Bacterial sporulation is a process in which bacteria like Bacillus subtilis divide to produce a smaller cell called a forespore . The forespore matures into a hardy spore that can survive in harsh conditions and transform into an active bacterium when conditions improve . During sporulation , the forespore is fully enclosed within the cytoplasm of the mother cell , which is also referred to as the engulfing cell . The process of engulfment is thought to involve the degradation of a protein called peptidoglycan , which forms the cell wall of the bacteria . However , it is not clear how the engulfing cell degrades the peptidoglycan wall of the forespore . Khanna et al . used a technique called cryo-electron tomography to study the process of engulfment in the bacteria . Cryo-electron tomography involves cooling samples to low temperatures and imaging them with a beam of electrons . This technique allowed Khanna et al . to visualize the engulfment process in detail . The images revealed that the peptidoglycan wall is not completely degraded during engulfment . Instead , a thin layer of peptidoglycan persists throughout the engulfment process . This thin layer is thought to be an important part of the mechanism that allows the engulfing cell to move around the forespore . Khanna et al . also observed that the engulfing cell forms finger-like projections that help it to move around the forespore . These projections are thought to be produced by enzymes that degrade the peptidoglycan wall . Taken together , the findings of Khanna et al . provide new insights into the process of engulfment in bacteria . The findings also provide new resources for studying the process of engulfment , including detailed images of the engulfment mechanism .
The cell membrane is a complex structure that separates the internal cell from the external environment . It is the site where many important biological processes take place . For example , cells use membrane proteins to transport nutrients and waste products into and out of the cell . These proteins are embedded in the membrane and have a specific shape that allows them to interact with other molecules . The interactions between these proteins and their ligands are critical for the function of the cell . This is why the study of these interactions is important in biology . However , labeling ligands for membrane proteins is time-consuming and expensive . It can also alter the ligand's behavior . This is why researchers are looking for alternative methods to study these interactions . Burtscher et al . have now developed a new method to study these interactions . They used a technique called capacitance recording . This method is similar to the way a voltage-clamp experiment is performed . In this experiment , the researchers recorded the changes in the electrical properties of the membrane . This revealed that binding of ligands to membrane proteins resulted in a change in the electrical properties of the membrane . This method can be used to study the interactions between membrane proteins and their ligands in real time . This is important because it allows researchers to understand how proteins work . It could also be used to develop new drugs that target membrane proteins .
Tuberculosis is the leading cause of death by a single microbe worldwide . This bacterium , Mycobacterium tuberculosis , is able to survive in the human body for many years and is resistant to many of the drugs used to treat it . The bacterium is able to survive in the human body because it can grow and multiply in the nutrient-rich environment of the body . This is aided by the fact that it can take up nutrients from the environment . Tuberculosis is thought to be able to grow and multiply in the human body by using nitrogen as a nutrient . Nitrogen is a nutrient that is abundant in the human body . However , the bacterium can only use a limited number of nitrogen sources . This makes it difficult to find new drugs that can kill the bacterium . Understanding how M . tuberculosis takes up and uses nitrogen is important to find new drugs that can kill the bacterium . The bacterium can take up nitrogen from a variety of sources , including the amino acids that make up proteins . Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins . It is not clear how the bacterium uses amino acids to take up nitrogen . To address this question , de Carvalho et al . grew M . tuberculosis cells in a nutrient-rich medium that contained amino acids . The bacterium was then transferred to a medium that contained amino acids as the only source of nitrogen . This allowed the bacterium to grow and take up nitrogen . De Carvalho et al . found that the bacterium was able to take up all of the amino acids that it needed to grow and survive . This suggests that the bacterium is able to use all of the amino acids as sources of nitrogen . De Carvalho et al . also found that the bacterium was able to use a number of amino acids as sources of nitrogen at the same time . This is unusual as most bacteria only use one nitrogen source at a time . The results of the study reveal new details about how M . tuberculosis takes up and uses nitrogen . This is important to understand how the bacterium is able to survive in the human body and to find new drugs that can kill it .
People need a new flu shot every year because flu viruses change fast and the vaccine needs to be updated to match the new strains. However , the vaccine may not be as effective as expected because flu viruses can change in an unpredictable way , often through mutations in their genetic material . Xue et al . analyzed flu samples taken over several weeks from cancer patients with longer-than-average flu infections due to their weaker immune systems . The patients’ infections lasted weeks or months , making it possible to examine longer-term within-host evolutionary dynamics . Xue et al . found that some of the mutations observed within the patients were the same mutations that eventually spread around the world . Xue et al . suggest that the parallel evolution of influenza at the within-host and global scales may reflect the same selective pressures acting on the virus .
Toxoplasma gondii is a parasite that can infect the brain and cause serious neurological problems in people with weakened immune systems . It is unclear why this parasite infects so few people , and how it manages to hide from the immune system . Here , Mendez-Ferro et al . used a mouse model to study how Toxoplasma infects the brain and to identify the neurons that are infected . The experiments revealed that Toxoplasma infects neurons in the brain , but the parasite does not infect neurons evenly across the brain . Instead , it infects the neurons in the cortex , which is the outer layer of the brain . The experiments also showed that Toxoplasma infects a small number of neurons in the striatum , which is the deep part of the brain involved in movement and reward . Toxoplasma parasites interacted with a specific type of neuron in the cortex , and these neurons were more likely to be infected with the parasite than other neurons in the cortex . In addition , the experiments showed that the parasite can manipulate the electrical activity of the neurons it infects . These changes in the electrical activity of neurons suggest that the parasite might be able to manipulate the behavior of the neurons it infects , which could have important implications for how the parasite interacts with its host . This work could help to improve our understanding of how the brain and the immune system work together to fight infections . In the future , the findings could also help to develop new drugs that could treat infections caused by Toxoplasma gondii .
The cholinergic system is believed to be important for REM sleep , the phase of sleep that is most similar to being awake , and is also implicated in the process of waking up from sleep . Ni, Hou et al . used a technique called optogenetics to activate the cholinergic system in mice . Optogenetics uses light to control and stimulate specific cells or neurons that have been genetically modified to respond to light . Ni, Hou et al . found that stimulating the cholinergic system caused awake mice to fall asleep and promoted more non-REM sleep in sleeping mice . This challenges the previous belief that cholinergic activity was linked to waking up by showing that the activation of the cholinergic system promotes sleep instead .
Monoculture refers to the practice of growing only one type of crop while excluding any other organism. In agriculture, this can lead to reduced biodiversity and lower productivity. Guo, Zhao et al. wanted to investigate how introducing aquatic animals into rice paddies could increase the yield and biodiversity of rice. They conducted experiments in China where farmers have long practiced coculture of rice and aquatic animals. The experiments showed that coculture increased rice yield and the amount of nutrients that were available for the rice plants to use. The results also showed that the aquatic animals helped to reduce the amount of weeds in the paddies and that the animals helped to break down organic matter in the soil. This suggests that coculture could be a sustainable way to increase the yield and biodiversity of rice.
In flies, sugar is a reward that activates dopamine neurons in the mushroom body . The dopamine neurons called PAM-α1 release dopamine in response to sugar and then activate other neurons in the mushroom body . However , it was previously unclear how the PAM-α1 neurons and other neurons in the mushroom body are connected to form long-term memories . Ichinose et al . studied the connections between dopamine neurons and other neurons in the mushroom body of flies . Ichinose et al . found that dopamine neurons called PAM-α1 and a specific type of neuron called MBON-α1 are connected in a feedback circuit . This feedback circuit is required for flies to form long-term memories of sugar rewards . The feedback circuit is also required for the formation of short-term memories , suggesting that the feedback circuit is a common mechanism underlying both short-term and long-term memory formation . Further studies are needed to understand the common mechanisms underlying short-term and long-term memory formation .
The human cytomegalovirus is a virus that can hide in blood stem cells and remain dormant for years before reactivating and causing illness . The virus can reactivate when the immune system is weakened , but the mechanisms behind this are not fully understood . Shnayder et al . used a technique called single-cell RNA analysis to study how the human cytomegalovirus interacts with blood stem cells and how this can affect the immune system . The results showed that the virus can suppress the immune system and that the cells carrying the highest levels of the virus are more likely to reactivate . These findings could help researchers develop new treatments for preventing the reactivation of the human cytomegalovirus .
Antibodies are proteins that can identify and target particular cells or molecules to neutralize or remove them from the body . In autoimmune diseases , antibodies target the body’s own cells and tissues , leading to inflammation and damage . Antibodies are made by white blood cells called B cells . The first step in making an antibody is to identify the target , which is called an antigen . The next step is to make a protein that can recognize the antigen . Once the antibody is made , it can bind to the antigen and trigger an immune response . Identifying antigens is therefore crucial in understanding how the immune system works and how autoimmune diseases develop . Antigens are usually proteins . However , many proteins have a number of different regions that can be targeted by antibodies . Identifying which of these regions are targeted by antibodies can help to identify which autoimmune diseases are associated with particular antigens . The immune system of people with autoimmune disease APS1 , a rare genetic condition , is more likely to make autoantibodies that target specific tissues . However , identifying which tissues are targeted by which autoantibodies is challenging . The antibodies are too small to be detected by most methods , and it is difficult to identify the specific antigens that they bind to . To identify new antigens , Vazquez et al . used a technique called PhIP-Seq . This method uses a large library of phages , which are bacteria-like organisms that can display proteins on their surface . The phages are then tested to see which ones bind to antibodies from people with APS1 . This allows the researchers to identify which proteins are targeted by the antibodies . Vazquez et al . used this method to test for antibodies against proteins in people with APS1 . The researchers found that 23 known antigens were targeted by antibodies in people with APS1 , and they also identified 69 new antigens that were targeted by antibodies . The new antigens were found to be associated with a number of autoimmune diseases , including ovarian insufficiency , diarrhea , and type 1 diabetes . Further studies will be needed to confirm whether these antigens are also targeted by antibodies in people with these diseases . This study shows that PhIP-Seq is a powerful tool for identifying new antigens that are targeted by antibodies in autoimmune diseases . This could help to identify new biomarkers for autoimmune diseases and to develop new treatments .
Pluripotent stem cells are cells that have the ability to differentiate into any type of cell in the body . In the mouse , pluripotent stem cells can be isolated from early embryos . However , it is not clear if pluripotent stem cells are present in other mammals . The experiments presented in this paper show that pluripotent stem cells can be isolated from finches at a stage of development when they are similar to the mouse embryo . This suggests that pluripotent stem cells may be conserved across species . The experiments also show that the expression of genes associated with pluripotency is preserved in cells from finch embryos that are cultured in the laboratory . This suggests that pluripotent stem cells are present in the early stages of development of the finch and that the genes associated with pluripotency are likely to be conserved across species .
Lipids are important for the survival and growth of humans and animals . They are also involved in many cell processes and are necessary for the formation of tissues and organs in animal embryos . The production of a specific type of lipid called sphingosine-1-phosphate is essential for embryonic development . Excess levels of certain sphingolipids can be toxic to cells , so animals carefully control the levels of these molecules to avoid toxicity . Mendelson et al . studied how the levels of sphingosine-1-phosphate are regulated in zebrafish embryos . The experiments showed that mutant embryos lacking the enzyme that converts sphingosine to sphingosine-1-phosphate were able to tolerate excess levels of sphingosine and survive . This was because the mutant embryos had an alternative pathway that could convert sphingosine to a non-toxic metabolite . Mendelson et al . also found that the mutant embryos had high levels of a protein called ceramide synthase 2b . This protein was able to sense and remove excess sphingosine , and it was required for the mutant embryos to tolerate the toxic sphingosine . Mendelson et al . suggest that this discovery could be used to develop new treatments for diseases caused by sphingolipid imbalance , such as diabetes and cancer , and enhance the survival of human egg cells in in vitro fertilization (IVF) and other fertility therapies .
In social insect colonies, such as ants and bees, individuals work together to build and maintain their colony . In these colonies, individuals have different roles , such as caring for the young or foraging for food . In social insect colonies , individuals work together instead of competing against each other , and division of labor allows groups to achieve more . This is because individuals can specialize in different tasks . For example , ants that forage for food are able to carry more food back to the colony than ants that care for the young . This division of labor is essential for cooperation because it allows groups to achieve more by individuals specializing in different tasks . In social insect colonies , division of labor is evident in the fact that only one or a few individual units can reproduce while the rest provide support . For example , in ants , only queens and males reproduce , while the young workers nurse the brood and older workers forage for food . In addition , individuals in a body or ant colony ensure the survival of the collective unit by working together instead of competing against each other . For example , in ants , individuals in the colony share food and other resources . This sharing of resources is known as trophallaxis . Trophallaxis is a form of social circulatory system , where nutrients and endogenously produced factors , such as hormones and immune defense factors , are transferred mouth-to-mouth from one individual to another . Trophallaxis and the social circulatory system are thought to be important for the social physiology of ants and other social insects . For example , trophallaxis is thought to help regulate the metabolism of ants and may also help them to survive in harsh environments . However , little is known about the composition of trophallactic fluid . Trophallactic fluid is a social fluid that is shared among individuals in social insect colonies . It contains many proteins , including proteins involved in fast sugar processing , and many molecules , including proteins involved in metabolism and many molecules involved in immunity . In this study , LeBoeuf et al . analyzed the proteins present in trophallactic fluid from a species of ant . The analysis showed that the composition of trophallactic fluid changes as the ant colony grows and matures . This suggests that trophallactic fluid plays a key role in regulating the social physiology of ants and other social insects .
Holoprosencephaly is a birth defect in which the brain and face do not develop properly. It is often caused by mutations in genes that help guide the development of the brain and face , and can also be caused by exposure to alcohol in the womb . Hong and Krauss have now shown that mice that are exposed to alcohol in the womb during the time when the Nodal signaling pathway is active are more likely to develop holoprosencephaly . This is because the Nodal signaling pathway is necessary to prevent holoprosencephaly , and exposure to alcohol can disrupt this pathway . Hong and Krauss also found that the Cdon gene , which is involved in the Nodal signaling pathway , interacts genetically with the pathway in mice that are exposed to alcohol . This suggests that Cdon is a key component of the Nodal signaling pathway and that it is responsible for the effects of alcohol on holoprosencephaly . These findings provide new insights into how common birth defects arise from a complex combination of genetic and environmental risk factors .
The connection between stress and alcohol use is highly complex and can be both a cause and a consequence. Heavy drinking has been shown to increase the risk of developing alcoholism , and chronic alcohol abuse can lead to increased sensitivity to stress . However , the biological mechanisms that link stress and alcohol use are not well understood . Here , Bloodgood et al . show that a protein called dynorphin is involved in the relationship between alcohol withdrawal and stress response in mice . The experiments reveal that dynorphin neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis are activated after long-term alcohol use and that blocking this protein in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis can normalize the stress response in mice . The results shed light on the circuitry in the brain responsible for the connection between alcohol withdrawal and the stress response . In the future , these findings could be used to understand the biological mechanisms underlying the relationship between stress and alcohol use and to develop new treatments to help recovering alcoholics cope with stress better .
Many animals on land produce their red blood cells in the liver or kidney. However , some fish and early limbed vertebrates produce their red blood cells in the bone marrow , which is a network of blood vessels inside the bone . How and when this difference in red blood cell production evolved in vertebrates is still unclear . Estefa et al . used x-rays to study the fossil bones of ancient fish and vertebrates . Estefa et al . found that the fossil bones of ancient fish and early limbed vertebrates lacked the bone cavities needed to support red blood cell production . These cavities were present in the bones of more advanced vertebrates , including mammals and birds . Estefa et al . conclude that red blood cell production in the bone marrow evolved independently in several groups of vertebrates .
The primary somatosensory cortex is responsible for processing information about the body , including sensations of touch , pain , and temperature . The cortex is organized in a way that each area of the body is represented in a specific location , with different areas of the body represented in different areas of the cortex . The traditional belief is that when a body part is lost , the cortex will 'overwrite' its representation with the representation of another body part . However , in 2013 , researchers found that people with phantom limbs still have representations of their missing limbs in their cortex . Now , Kikkert , Kolasinski et al . have studied the brain activity of two amputees with phantom hands , and found that the cortex of the missing hand is still organized in a way that reflects the hand’s individual characteristics . These findings suggest that the brain can retain information about the missing hand even after many years . This could have implications for the development of prosthetic limbs , as it may be possible to use the information stored in the cortex to develop intuitive control of the prosthetic limb .
Insulin is a hormone that controls the amount of sugar in the blood . When blood sugar levels are high , the pancreas produces more insulin . The amount of insulin released from the pancreas is controlled by the presence of a protein called ATP , which is the energy currency of the cell . When the levels of ATP are high , the pancreas produces less insulin . Lee et al . used a microscopy technique that can image biological molecules at the atomic scale to study the structure of a protein called KATP , which is found in the pancreatic cells that produce insulin . The KATP protein is a channel that controls the flow of ions across the membrane of the pancreatic cells . Lee et al . found that the structure of KATP contains a lasso-like structure that connects the binding sites for ATP and ADP . This structure allows ATP to override the effects of ADP and control the flow of ions . The lasso-like structure also suggests that the channel may be able to sense changes in the ATP/ADP ratio and respond accordingly . Lee et al . believe that this mechanism may help to explain why mutations in the KATP protein can lead to the development of diabetes . Further studies are needed to understand how this mechanism works and whether it can be exploited to treat genetic diseases where infants produce too much or too little insulin .
Communication between bacteria and yeast is a common occurrence in the environment . However , very little is known about how they communicate . In the human body , bacteria and yeast live in close proximity to each other and it is thought that they may be able to communicate to help each other out . Garcia , Dietrich et al . have now discovered a chemical message that bacteria can use to communicate with yeast . The chemical message is a compound called lactic acid . Garcia , Dietrich et al . used yeast cells to identify the chemical message produced by bacteria and found that it could be used to induce a prion in yeast . A prion is a type of molecule that can be inherited from one cell to another . This discovery provides a new insight into how bacteria and yeast can communicate and could lead to new ways to prevent bacterial infections in the human body .
Transcription factors are proteins that control the activity of individual genes by binding to enhancer regions of DNA , thus influencing when specific genes are switched on or off . Enhancers are sequences of DNA that act as switches to turn on or off gene activity . However , the factors that control the activity of enhancers are not fully understood . The Sonic hedgehog ( Shh ) gene is a key regulator of digit development in the limb bud . Shh is switched on in the zone of polarizing activity ( ZPA ) , a region at the back of the limb bud . The Shh enhancer , called the ZRS , is also located in the ZPA . Mutations in the ZRS can result in the limbs being malformed , with implications for many other diseases . The ZRS is a complex enhancer that exists in three different states in cells across the limb bud , poised to be active . Here , Lettice et al . show that the ZRS is also poised in limb bud cells . However , the ZRS is not active in the cells , suggesting that there are additional factors that control its activity . Lettice et al . identified the fibroblast growth factor ( FGF ) signaling pathway as a key regulator of the ZRS . In the limb bud , FGFs are produced in the apical ectodermal ridge ( AER ) , a structure that is responsible for the growth of the limb . FGFs are known to regulate the ZRS . However , inhibition of FGF signaling prevents the ZRS from being poised , suggesting that FGFs are required to keep the ZRS in a poised state . In addition , FGF signaling also controls the activity of other transcription factors that regulate the ZRS . This study reveals the complexity of the ZRS and how it is regulated by multiple signaling pathways . This work may provide a basis for understanding how other enhancer elements operate in development .
The human genome contains millions of tiny variations , some of which can affect how well a person can survive and reproduce . Most of the time , these variations have little effect on how well a person can survive and reproduce . However , in some cases , these variations can have a major impact . For example , a variation in a gene called CYP2D6 can affect how well a person can metabolize certain drugs . If a person has a variation in CYP2D6 that causes the gene to be less active , they may be more likely to develop a condition called drug-induced liver injury . In animals , genetic variations can also affect how well an individual can survive and reproduce . For example , a variation in the gene for the protein called CYP2D6 can affect how well a worm can survive and reproduce . The worm C . elegans is a common model organism in biology . It is easy to work with and has a relatively simple genome . Paaby et al . have now used C . elegans to study how genetic variations affect embryogenesis . This is the process by which an embryo develops from a fertilized egg . Paaby et al . used a technique called a ‘modifier screen’ to study the effects of genetic variations on embryogenesis in C . elegans . This technique involves feeding worms a chemical that silences a particular gene . This allows the researchers to see if a particular variation in the gene has any effect on the embryo . The experiments revealed that many variations in the genes that control embryogenesis can have a significant impact on the embryo . In some cases , these variations can cause the embryo to die . In other cases , they can cause the embryo to develop into an abnormal organism . This discovery may help to explain how genetic variations can affect the development of complex processes in animals over time .
The human immune system is made up of different types of cells that work together to protect the body from disease . CD4 T cells are a type of white blood cell that can recognize specific proteins on the surface of an invading pathogen and trigger an immune response . CD4 T cells are able to remember the proteins they have encountered in the past , so that they can quickly mount a response if they encounter the same pathogen again . The ability of CD4 T cells to remember specific proteins is called a memory . The CD4 T cells of healthy individuals often have a memory for proteins that are present on the surface of viruses and bacteria . However , it is not clear whether this ability to remember proteins is inherited or if it is acquired through exposure to the pathogens . Elias et al . studied the role of preexisting memory CD4 T cells in vaccine-induced immunity by analyzing the memory CD4 T cells of individuals who had not been exposed to hepatitis B virus . The experiments showed that individuals with more preexisting memory CD4 T cells had an earlier and more vigorous immune response to the vaccine . Elias et al . also identified a subset of CD4 T cells that are expanded in individuals with a delayed and modest immune response to the vaccine . The findings of this study suggest that individuals with more preexisting memory CD4 T cells may be more likely to develop immunity to vaccines .
When an invading pathogen enters the body , the immune system quickly recognizes it and launches a response to eliminate it . The immune response is activated when host cells are damaged or stressed , or when foreign molecules indicating the presence of microbes and pathogens are detected . The immune system responds by activating the production of white blood cells , which engulf and digest infected host cells or pathogens . These white blood cells are then activated to recognize and attack the invading pathogen . The immune system also produces proteins called antibodies that bind to specific pathogens and trigger the activation of white blood cells . The immune system also produces proteins called T cells , which are activated to recognize specific antigens . T cells are activated when they bind to an antigen presented by a molecule called major histocompatibility complex . The immune system can also recognize specific antigens that are displayed by a molecule called a self-peptide . Lo et al . investigated the relationship between positive selection and CD4+ T cell immunodominance . Positive selection occurs when a white blood cell is activated to recognize a specific antigen and then selectively expands to form a specific repertoire of T cells . The immune system also has a mechanism called immunodominance , which means that only a few fragments of a pathogen can stimulate an immune response . Lo et al . found that positive selection was the driving force behind immunodominance . Lo et al . also found that the single self-peptide gp250 skewed the positive selection of MCC-reactive T cells toward MCC-reactive CDR3 features . This suggests that positive selection skews the selection of TCRs , and that the specificity of the immune response is determined by the positive selection of TCRs .
Sensory information is processed in several stages before it is interpreted by the brain . The first stage is the detection of sensory information by the receptors that are embedded in the skin . These receptors are specialized to detect different types of sensory information , such as touch , pressure , or temperature . The receptors then transmit the information to the brain , where it is processed in a specific way . For example , the brain can tell the difference between a gentle touch and a sharp pain because the receptors that detect gentle touches are more sensitive than those that detect sharp pains . In the brain , the information is processed by neurons that receive input from the different receptors . The neurons are connected to each other , and the information they receive from the receptors is integrated into the activity of the neurons . The integration process is thought to be optimized to preserve as much information as possible about the objects we interact with . This means that the neurons in the brain can quickly and efficiently process information about the objects we interact with , and use this information to make appropriate responses . This is important for the brain to gather information about objects effectively and make appropriate responses . For example , when we pick up a book , the neurons that detect the pressure of our fingers on the book send information to the neurons that detect the weight of the book , and the neurons that detect the texture of the book . The neurons then integrate this information and use it to make a response . This response might be to pick up the book , or to put it down . The neurons then transmit this response to other neurons in the brain . These neurons then use the information to make further responses . For example , the neurons that detect the movement of the book might send information to the neurons that detect the movement of our hand . The neurons that detect the movement of our hand might then use this information to make a response . This response might be to move our hand towards the book , or to move it away from the book . The neurons then transmit this response to other neurons in the brain , and so on . However , it is not clear how the neurons in the brain integrate information from different receptors to make a response . To answer this question , Saal et al . recorded the activity of neurons in the brain of monkeys as they touched different objects . The neurons were connected to different types of receptors that detect different types of touch . Saal et al . then built a computer model that simulated how the neurons in the brain integrate information from the different receptors to make a response . The model showed that different types of receptors control the strength and timing of the response in different ways . For example , one type of receptor was mostly excitatory , which means it made the neurons fire more often . Another type of receptor was balanced , which means it had both excitatory and inhibitory effects . This means that the neurons in the brain integrate information from the different receptors in different ways , and this integration is optimized to preserve as much information as possible about the objects we interact with . The next step is to understand why the neurons in the brain integrate information from different receptors in this way . One reason could be that the neurons in the brain are adapted to the natural objects we interact with . Another reason could be that the neurons in the brain are adapted to the way that the receptors in the skin respond to different objects . Further research is needed to understand why the neurons in the brain integrate information from different receptors in this way , and to understand how this integration helps us to interact with objects .
Dengue is a disease caused by a virus that spreads through mosquito bites . It is the most common cause of fever in the tropics and subtropics , and it affects more than 390 million people each year . The virus is transmitted by the Aedes mosquito , which is found in many parts of the world . The virus causes flu-like symptoms in people , and in some cases it can be fatal . The best way to prevent the spread of dengue is to reduce the number of mosquitoes that carry the virus . This is done by removing the places where mosquitoes can lay their eggs . This can be done by removing the water that collects in containers such as buckets , tires , and other items . In 2013 , a major dengue outbreak occurred in Fiji , an island in the Pacific Ocean . The outbreak led to the introduction of a nationwide mosquito clean-up campaign . Kucharski et al . used data collected during the outbreak to study the transmission of dengue . The data showed that the campaign coincided with a reduction in the number of people who became sick with dengue . This suggests that the campaign helped to reduce the number of people who became infected with the virus . This is important because it suggests that the campaign was effective in reducing the spread of dengue . However , the data also showed that the number of people who became sick with dengue was not reduced by as much as expected . This suggests that other factors may also be important in the transmission of dengue . Kucharski et al . also found that the most likely age group to become infected with dengue was children and teenagers between the ages of 10 and 19 . This is important because it suggests that children and teenagers may be at a higher risk of becoming infected with dengue . Further research is needed to understand how dengue spreads and how to prevent it .
The brain is the seat of cognition , the process that allows us to think , learn , remember , and make decisions . Cognitive neuroscience is a field that aims to understand how the brain is involved in cognition . One of the main tools used in cognitive neuroscience is computational modeling . Researchers use these models to simulate brain activity and to predict the effects of different brain processes on behavior . However , the brain is a complex and dynamic system , and it is difficult to model how it works . One approach is to build computational models that simulate the brain activity and behavior , and then use statistical methods to analyze the data generated by these models . In this way , researchers can study how the brain processes information , how it makes decisions , and how it can be affected by different factors . For example , researchers can use computational models to study how the brain processes visual information , and how it can be affected by different stimuli . The models can also be used to study how the brain processes information in real-time , by simulating the brain activity while a person is performing a task . However , the computational models used in cognitive neuroscience are not always reliable . They often require a large number of simulations to generate reliable results . This can be a challenge because it is difficult to perform many simulations . Fengler et al . have now developed a new method that can be used to build computational models of cognition . The method is based on machine learning algorithms , which are commonly used in artificial intelligence . The method can be used to simulate how the brain processes information , and how it makes decisions . It can also be used to study how the brain can be affected by different factors . The method is fast and efficient , and it can be used to simulate the brain activity in real-time . This means that researchers can use the method to analyze the brain activity in real-time , and to understand how the brain processes information in real-time . The method can also be used to study the brain activity in different conditions , such as when a person is tired or when they are exposed to different stimuli . The method has the potential to be used to study the brain activity of people with different conditions , such as depression or schizophrenia . In the future , it could also be used to study the brain activity of people in different age groups .
The lungs are filled with tiny air sacs called alveoli . Inside these air sacs are tiny blood vessels called capillaries . The capillaries are surrounded by a thin membrane called the endothelium . This membrane allows oxygen to pass from the air into the blood , and carbon dioxide to leave the blood and enter the air . If the endothelium becomes damaged , the lung tissue can become inflamed and the air sacs can fill with fluid . This can lead to severe breathing difficulties and even death . The endothelium is made up of many different types of cells , but scientists did not know how they all work together . Now , Niethamer et al . have used a technique called single-cell analysis to study endothelial cells in mice that have been infected with the H1N1 flu virus . This revealed that endothelial cells divide to help repair the damaged lung tissue . It also revealed that one type of endothelial cell , called the Car4-high EC , is particularly good at dividing . This suggests that these cells may be important in helping the lung to recover from damage . This discovery could help scientists to develop treatments to improve the lung’s ability to repair itself .
Caenorhabditis elegans is a common model organism used to study how animals grow and develop . Like many other animals , C . elegans hermaphrodites have both male and female reproductive organs . Hermaphrodites can reproduce on their own , but they can also mate with another hermaphrodite or a male to produce more offspring . Mating with males shortens the lifespan of hermaphrodites . Previous studies showed that this shortened lifespan is caused by the production of proteins that damage the soma , or main body , of the worm . Booth et al . investigated whether this shortened lifespan is caused by the presence of a specific type of protein called sperm . They found that the soma of young hermaphrodites is resistant to the negative effects of mating with males . Young hermaphrodites are also able to self-fertilize , but older hermaphrodites are not . This suggests that the soma of young hermaphrodites is able to sense when it is being fertilized by sperm , and this protects the soma from the negative effects of mating with males . Booth et al . also showed that the same mechanism protects hermaphrodites in other nematode worms . This suggests that the mechanism could be used to protect other animals from the negative effects of sexual interactions .
Understanding how neurons in the brain work together to process information is a major goal of neuroscience . This requires a detailed understanding of how neurons in a particular region of the brain respond to stimuli . To study the activity of neurons in a particular region of the brain , neuroscientists often use a technique called voltage-sensitive dye imaging . This involves using a dye that changes color when a neuron is active . However , it is difficult to measure the activity of individual neurons using this technique , because the dye changes color when the neuron is activated by a stimulus , and it is not clear whether the change in color is due to the neuron being active or to the stimulus itself . To overcome this problem , Seidemann et al . have developed a new technique called genetically encoded imaging . This involves using a virus to infect neurons in a particular region of the brain and alter their activity in response to a stimulus . This allows the activity of neurons in the region to be measured in a precise and reliable way . The technique developed by Seidemann et al . allows neurons in the visual cortex of a macaque to be imaged over several months . This allowed the activity of neurons in the visual cortex to be measured in response to a variety of stimuli , including flashing lights . The technique also allowed the activity of neurons in the visual cortex to be measured in response to a stimulus at a particular location in the visual field . Seidemann et al . also developed a mathematical model to predict how the activity of neurons in the visual cortex changes in response to a stimulus . This model was able to accurately predict the activity of neurons in the visual cortex , and was able to explain how the activity of neurons in the region changes in response to a stimulus . This new technique is likely to be used to study the activity of neurons in the visual cortex in response to a variety of stimuli . It will also be used to study the activity of neurons in other regions of the brain .
Living cells are surrounded by a membrane that separates the cell from its environment . The membrane is made up of a mixture of water and fatty molecules , which are known as lipids . The membrane proteins are the proteins that sit on the membrane and help the cell to interact with its environment . These proteins are often difficult to study because they are too big and hydrophobic , meaning they are repelled by water . To study membrane proteins , scientists often use detergents to break up the membrane and release the proteins . However , detergents can damage the proteins and sometimes interfere with the experiments . Carlson et al . have now developed a new method for studying membrane proteins . This method uses a small protein called a peptide to stabilize the proteins and keep them in water . The peptide is designed to bind to the membrane protein and form a structure that is similar to the membrane . The peptide is made of a long chain of amino acids , the building blocks of proteins . The peptide is also designed to be soluble in water , so it does not interfere with the experiments . The new method is called the ‘peptidisc’ . It can be used to study membrane proteins that are normally difficult to study . In the future , the peptidisc could be used to develop new drugs that target membrane proteins .
DNA molecules can become damaged by various agents . DNA molecules also have the ability to repair themselves . When DNA molecules are damaged , the DNA molecule can repair itself by copying the damaged DNA and replacing it with a copy of the undamaged DNA . DNA molecules can also repair themselves by cutting out the damaged DNA and repairing the cut part . DNA molecules can also repair themselves by replacing a damaged part with a part from another DNA molecule . This process of replacing a damaged part with a part from another DNA molecule is called homologous recombination . DNA molecules can also repair themselves by searching for a matching part of another DNA molecule and replacing the damaged part with the matching part . This process of searching for a matching part of another DNA molecule is called homology search . Homology search is an important process in DNA repair . The process of homology search is carried out by proteins called RecA . RecA is a protein that is present in all living organisms . RecA is one of the proteins that can repair damaged DNA molecules by searching for a matching part of another DNA molecule and replacing the damaged part with the matching part . RecA is a large protein that can bind to a DNA molecule and then search for a matching part of another DNA molecule . Once the RecA protein finds a matching part of another DNA molecule , it can replace the damaged part with the matching part . This process is called strand exchange . The RecA protein can also bind to a DNA molecule and search for a matching part of another DNA molecule without replacing the damaged part with the matching part . The RecA protein can also bind to a DNA molecule and then search for a matching part of another DNA molecule by sliding along the DNA . The RecA protein can bind to a DNA molecule and then slide along the DNA to search for a matching part of another DNA molecule . The RecA protein can also bind to a DNA molecule and then slide along the DNA to replace a damaged part with a matching part . The RecA protein can also bind to a DNA molecule and then slide along the DNA to repair a damaged part . The RecA protein can also bind to a DNA molecule and then slide along the DNA to repair a damaged part by searching for a matching part of another DNA molecule and replacing the damaged part with the matching part .
Gaze following is the ability to determine where someone is looking and redirecting attention to that position. Gaze following is important for social behavior, learning, and recognizing that others have a mind of their own. In humans, gaze following is based on the orientation of the face. In monkeys, however, gaze following is based on the orientation of the head. Marciniak et al . studied the brain regions that are involved in gaze following in monkeys. The experiments showed that the brain regions that are involved in gaze following are not part of the face patches network that is responsible for face processing. Instead , a new patch of brain tissue was found that is specifically involved in gaze following. This new patch is located close to the face patches network and is responsible for extracting relevant facial features from the face that is being looked at. The results suggest that gaze following in monkeys and humans may be closely related, with the key difference being that monkeys use the orientation of the head to determine the direction to look at, whereas humans use the orientation of the face.
Feeding behavior is not only driven by hunger , but also by learned eating habits and environmental cues . For example , some people eat more when they are in a social setting , or when they are stressed . However , the neural mechanisms that control learned eating habits are not well understood . In the stomach , ghrelin is a hormone that increases appetite . The brain has a number of different regions that are involved in the regulation of appetite , but it is not clear how ghrelin communicates with these regions . Kanoski et al . used a combination of different approaches to investigate the role of ghrelin in feeding behavior . Kanoski et al . found that ghrelin activated a specific group of neurons in the hippocampus , a brain region involved in learning and memory control . This activation increased the activity of another group of neurons in a region of the brain called the lateral hypothalamus , which is also involved in the regulation of appetite . Kanoski et al . also found that ghrelin activated a specific pathway in the lateral hypothalamus that involved the hormone orexin . Orexin is also known as a neurotransmitter that is involved in the regulation of appetite . Kanoski et al . suggest that ghrelin activates the orexin pathway in the lateral hypothalamus , which in turn stimulates appetite and feeding behavior . These findings suggest that ghrelin may play a role in the regulation of appetite and feeding behavior in people with eating disorders . Further studies are needed to determine if this is the case .
Many mammals have reduced or lost their sense of sight because of living underground. The eyes of these mammals are often smaller and less complex than those of species that live above ground. Understanding how the eye is formed could have applications beyond evolutionary and biological studies . Partha et al . studied the DNA of four subterranean mammals . They found that many genes involved in vision were more likely to change over time in the subterranean mammals than in mammals that lived above ground . This suggests that the genes involved in vision are less important for the subterranean mammals . Partha et al . also found that some genes involved in skin and hair were more likely to change over time in the subterranean mammals than in mammals that lived above ground . This suggests that the subterranean mammals have become more hairy and have thicker skin to cope with the dark and damp conditions of the underground environment . This is the first study to show that the rate of evolution of genes involved in vision changes in mammals living underground . The findings suggest that the eyes of subterranean mammals have evolved in response to the dim light of their environment . The study also shows that the rate of evolution of genes involved in skin and hair changes in subterranean mammals . This suggests that the subterranean mammals have evolved to cope with the conditions of the underground environment .
Signaling molecules are substances that trigger reactions inside cells . These molecules bind to a protein called AKAP79 , which anchors the signaling molecule to the cell membrane . This allows the signaling molecule to interact with other proteins and trigger a reaction . AKAP79 also interacts with a protein called PP2B , which is a type of phosphatase that removes phosphate groups from proteins . PP2B is important for the body's immune response , and is also involved in the heart's electrical activity . Drugs that target PP2B can have unintended side effects , such as changes in blood glucose levels and heart rate . Understanding how AKAP79 and PP2B interact could help in the development of drugs with fewer side effects . Nygren et al . used an electron microscope to investigate the interaction between AKAP79 and PP2B . They discovered that AKAP79 can bind to PP2B in different ways depending on the amount of calcium ions in the cell . In the presence of low calcium levels , AKAP79 binds to PP2B in a way that blocks its activity . However , when calcium levels are higher , AKAP79 binds to PP2B in a way that allows it to be more active . This means that AKAP79 can fine-tune the activity of PP2B by controlling how much calcium is present in the cell . Future studies could use this information to develop drugs that target PP2B with fewer side effects .
People who lose a hand or an arm face a significant challenge in performing daily activities such as tying their shoelaces . This loss can have a significant impact on a person’s quality of life , and can also affect their employability . In some cases , people with a missing hand or arm may compensate by using their intact hand or their residual limb . How the brain adapts to this loss is not well understood . Makin et al . investigated the brain activity of people with congenital hand absence , and people who had lost their hand , while they performed tasks that required the use of their intact hand or their residual arm . The results showed that the region of the brain that controlled the missing hand was activated when people with congenital hand absence used their residual arm , and when people with acquired hand absence used their intact hand . This suggests that the brain can adapt to the loss of a limb by reorganizing itself to compensate for the loss of the missing limb . The results also suggest that the degree of reorganization depends on the extent to which the missing limb is used . This study provides new insights into the mechanisms of brain reorganization following limb loss , and may help to improve rehabilitation techniques for people who have lost a limb .
Cells divide to form two daughter cells that are different in size and shape . The division process is controlled by the position of the spindle , which contains the chromosomes . The spindle is pulled towards the center of the cell , and as it divides , it rotates to ensure that the chromosomes are evenly distributed between the two daughter cells . The position of the spindle is controlled by a complex of proteins that forms a ring around the spindle . This complex is made up of three proteins: Gα , GPR-1/2 , and LIN-5 . The Gα protein is a signaling molecule that is involved in many different processes . It binds to GPR-1/2 , which is a protein that helps to localize the complex to the cell membrane . The Gα protein also binds to LIN-5 , which is a protein that helps to activate the dynein motor protein . This motor protein pulls the spindle towards the center of the cell . The Gα protein also binds to a molecule called GTP , which helps to activate the Gα protein . However , it is not clear how Gα binds to the GTP molecule . Fielmich , Schmidt et al . have now used a new technique to study the different roles of the components of the complex . This allowed them to see which proteins were needed to form the ring , and which were not . The experiments also showed that the Gα protein is not needed to form the ring , and that the dynein motor protein is only activated by the Gα protein when it is bound to GTP . The results provide new insights into how the spindle position is controlled . Future research may help to explain how the position of the spindle is controlled in other organisms .
Amblyopia is commonly known as 'lazy eye'. It is a condition in which the vision in one eye is not fully developed, and is often seen in children. However, the adult mammalian visual system is thought to be less adaptable to change than the mammalian visual system of children . Kaneko and Stryker's data suggests that the adult mammalian visual system may be more adaptable to change than previously believed . Kaneko and Stryker examined the effects of running on the visual cortex of mice that had been deprived of vision in one eye during early life . The results showed that running dramatically enhances the recovery of visual responses , almost to normal levels within a week . Surprisingly , the recovery of response was specific to the particular visual stimuli presented during locomotion . Neither locomotion alone nor visual stimulation alone promoted recovery . The findings suggest that running can facilitate plasticity in the adult mammalian visual system .
Leaf-cutting ants are known to form symbiotic relationships with fungi that live in underground chambers and on the ants’ nests . These fungi are obligatory multinucleate and polyploid , meaning that they are required for the ants to efficiently feed on the plant material they harvest . The ants harvest leaves from plants and cut them into small pieces , which they then mix with their fecal liquid and deposit on the fungi’s nests . This results in the formation of a fungus garden that is harvested by the ants for food . The ants and the fungi work together to efficiently break down plant material . This is achieved by the fungi producing enzymes that are then transferred to the ants through their fecal fluid . The ants then spread the enzymes on the plant material and use the resulting hydroxyl radicals to break down the plant material .
Traumatic or stressful events may lead to the development of anxiety disorders . Many people are affected by these disorders and they can have a negative impact on a person's quality of life . However , it is not always clear what triggers these disorders or how they develop . It is known that a chemical called cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) is involved in the development of anxiety disorders . In fact , people who are treated with drugs that inhibit COX-2 may experience fewer symptoms of anxiety . Gamble-George et al . investigated the role of COX-2 inhibition in reducing stress-induced anxiety-like behavior in mice . The experiments showed that the COX-2 inhibitor , LM-4131 , reduced anxiety-like behavior in mice after they were exposed to a stressful event . The inhibitor worked by reducing the activity of a specific type of brain cell called an excitatory neuron . This reduction in excitatory neuron activity was blocked by a drug that blocks the action of a specific type of receptor called a cannabinoid receptor . These results suggest that COX-2 inhibition may be useful in treating anxiety disorders . Future studies will be needed to confirm this hypothesis .
Understanding how proteins work is one of the most important goals in biology . Proteins are made up of long chains of amino acids that fold into complex shapes . These shapes are held together by weak chemical bonds , which are often broken and re-made as the proteins perform their functions . The movements of these proteins are not captured by X-ray crystallography , which is a technique that determines the three-dimensional structure of a protein from the way it reflects X-rays . However , the technique can provide information about how proteins change shape over time . Burnley et al . have now developed a new method that can use this information to create more realistic models of how proteins change shape . This new method is called ‘ensemble refinement’ . It combines data from X-ray crystallography with a computer program called ‘molecular dynamics’ , which simulates the movements of proteins . The method can be used to study the movements of proteins that are difficult to study using X-ray crystallography alone . This includes proteins that are sensitive to temperature , or proteins that have unusual structures . Burnley et al . tested the method on 20 proteins . They found that it improved the accuracy of the X-ray data and allowed them to see more of the movements of the proteins . This included movements that were not captured by the X-ray data . This new method could help scientists to better understand how proteins work . It could also help them to design drugs that target proteins in new ways .
