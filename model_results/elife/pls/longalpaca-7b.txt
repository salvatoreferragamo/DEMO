The paper describes an experiment that tested whether the cerebellum can learn to perform a sequence of movements by using feedback signals from previous movements as a new "cue" to learn the next movement in the sequence. The researchers trained rabbits to perform a sequence of left eyelid movements with an electrical stimulus as the cue. They found that the rabbits were able to learn this sequence using feedback signals from the previous left eyelid movement to serve as a cue to learn the next movement. This allowed the rabbits to learn a sequence of movements involving multiple eyelid movements. The researchers also found that the same Purkinje cells, which are the main output neurons of the cerebellum, showed decreases in activity that matched the timing of both the first and second eyelid movements, indicating that the same cerebellar mechanisms were involved in learning both movements. The feedback signals likely came from deep cerebellar neurons, which provide output to the cerebellar cortex. The study suggests that feedback signals from previous movements can be used by the cerebellum to learn and execute complex sequences of movements, providing a framework for understanding how the cerebellum can learn to guide cortical activity to produce desired movements.
This paper describes the structure of the mTORC2 complex, a key regulator of cellular metabolism and growth. The authors used cryo-electron microscopy to study the human mTORC2 complex, which consists of mTOR, mLST8, Rictor, SIN1 and Protor-1. They found that mTORC2 is a dimeric complex with an arrangement similar to that of mTORC1, but with a more labile structure. They identified density features in the mTOR dimer and accessory proteins, including a tower-like structure in Rictor that connects the bridge and buttress, and a cap region at the FRB domain. They confirmed that Rictor interacts with the mTOR dimer at the same site as in mTORC1. The differences between mTORC1 and mTORC2 in the mTOR-exposed surfaces of the horn region may be linked to their distinct modes of regulation. The authors also found that mTORC2 is more labile and had lower resolution than mTORC1, likely due to the complex's flexibility and the need for crosslinking to stabilize the sample. However, the structure of mTORC2 provides insights into the architecture of the mTOR complex and the interactions of its accessory proteins.
The paper describes a new phenomenon where people's perception of numbers is influenced by their motion direction. The researchers found that when people move their eyes or body in a certain way, their perception of small numbers is either overestimated or underestimated depending on the direction of the motion. This effect occurs in a specific area of the brain called the intraparietal sulcus, which is involved in processing numbers. The researchers suggest that this shows that the brain's processing of numbers and space are interconnected, and that the same circuits that process space also process numbers. The findings suggest that the brain's processing of numbers is not completely replaced by new circuits, but rather the old circuits are augmented to allow for computations across different domains. This is consistent with the idea that the brain recycles or reuses existing circuits, rather than creating entirely new ones.
The researchers discovered that a type of protein called Musashi-1 (Msi1) is involved in controlling the growth of cells in the brain and spinal cord. They found that fatty acids, specifically those with 18-2 carbon chains between 18 and 20 carbons, inhibit Msi1's ability to recognize and bind to RNA. They also found that Msi1 regulates the enzyme stearoyl-CoA desaturase, which is involved in making monounsaturated fatty acids from saturated fatty acids. The researchers propose that Msi1 controls cell growth through a feedback loop involving Msi1, SCD, and the lipids produced by SCD. This loop may be important for regulating cell growth and differentiation.
This paper describes how the protein SYT7 regulates synaptic vesicle replenishment in neurons. The authors found that SYT7 functions as a Ca2+ sensor that regulates Ca2+-dependent vesicle replenishment during synaptic transmission. They showed that SYT7 is specifically bound to the CaM protein, which also plays a role in synaptic vesicle replenishment. The authors propose that a complex formed between SYT7 and CaM regulates the Ca2+-dependent pathway that replenishes synaptic vesicles. They found that loss of SYT7 leads to reduced synaptic vesicle replenishment, and that this effect can be rescued by expressing SYT7, but not a Ca2+-ligand mutant form of SYT7 that does not bind Ca2+. They also showed that CDZ, a CaM antagonist, phenocopies the effects of SYT7 loss on synaptic vesicle replenishment, suggesting that SYT7 and CaM cooperate to regulate this process. The study provides evidence that SYT7 is a Ca2+ sensor that regulates synaptic vesicle replenishment.
The paper discusses the potential therapeutic use of inhibiting cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) activity for treating mood and anxiety disorders. The authors tested the effects of three COX-2 inhibitors, LM-4131, Lumiracoxib, and Celecoxib, on behavioral measures of anxiety and depression in mice. They found that all three inhibitors reduced stress-induced anxiety-like behaviors, but had little effect on basal anxiety or depression-like behaviors. The effects were specific to the time of day of drug administration and were maintained after repeated stress exposure. The COX-2 inhibitors worked through different mechanisms, including reducing inflammatory prostaglandins, increasing endocannabinoids, and reducing COX-2 metabolism. The authors suggest that inhibiting COX-2 may reduce anxiety by modulating the encoding of negative valence by amygdala neurons. The results provide evidence that COX-2 inhibitors may be a viable new class of drugs for treating stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders.
The paper describes a new method called "peptidisc" for reconstituting membrane proteins in a detergent-free environment. The peptidisc method uses a peptide that wraps around the membrane protein to stabilize it in aqueous solution, unlike current methods that require detergents to extract and purify membrane proteins. The peptidisc method can be used with membrane proteins of different sizes and complexities and does not require adding extra lipids, unlike current methods that require matching lipids to the diameter of the scaffold. The peptide assembly is self-determined and does not require modifications to the ends of the peptide, unlike other scaffolding molecules. The peptidisc method is fast, easy to synthesize, and does not suffer from instability or heterogeneity issues, making it a practical way to analyze or exploit membrane proteins without detergents. The paper shows that the peptidisc can capture membrane proteins in a functional state and maintain their activity. The peptidisc method is compared to other membrane reconstitution methods and is found to be more efficient, cost-effective, and suitable for a wider range of membrane proteins.
This paper describes a method to identify transcript errors in bacterial genomes using a modified version of the "circleseq" sequencing approach. The method minimizes RNA damage during library preparation to improve accuracy. They applied the method to five bacterial species (Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Mycobacterium florum, Aeromonas hydrophila, and Bacterium tumefaciens) and identified thousands of transcript errors in each species. They found that the error rates are much higher than expected based on genetic mutation rates and the molecular spectra of transcript errors suggests a bias towards C-U substitutions. The distribution of nonsense errors along mRNA transcripts also suggests a mechanism similar to nonsense-mediated decay in eukaryotes, but with a possible alternative ribosome-release model in prokaryotes. They found that the high concentration of rATPs in prokaryotes may contribute to the bias towards G-A substitutions. The study provides insights into the mechanisms of transcript errors in prokaryotes and highlights the need for future research to evaluate the degradation of transcript errors after initial generation.
The paper explores how people with one-handedness adapt to their disability by using their residual arm or intact hand differently. The study found that people with acquired one-handedness who rely more on their intact hand show more activity in the part of the brain that represents the missing hand during intact hand movements, while those with congenital one-handedness show more activity in the part that represents the residual arm during residual arm movements. This suggests that the brain adapts to compensatory behaviors by reorganizing its representation of the missing hand or residual arm. The study also found that people who incorporate their residual arm more into their daily activities show less intact hand activity in the brain, indicating that adaptive behaviors may influence brain plasticity beyond just the primary sensorimotor cortex. The findings shed light on the extent of adult brain plasticity and have implications for rehabilitation of one-handed individuals.
The paper discusses how the evolution of long bones in early tetrapods (four-legged animals) may have occurred differently than previously thought. The authors analyze fossilized limb bones from stem and crown tetrapods to see how long bone elongation and bone marrow development changed in these early tetrapods. They find that stem tetrapods like Apateon and Dolespeton likely elongated their bones through globuli ossei, which are small calcium deposits, rather than through a columnar growth plate as seen in amniotes. This suggests that long bone elongation was more primitive in stem tetrapods. However, the metaphyseal trabeculae in the limb bones of crown tetrapods like Metoposaurus, Seymouria and Discosaurus exhibit a fan-like arrangement, indicating they had a columnar growth plate where endochondral ossification occurred. This supports the idea that columnar elongation was the primitive state in tetrapods. Amphibians have a derived bone marrow development, with tubular structures opening into the medullary cavity, which is different from the closed system seen in stem tetrapods. The authors conclude that the evolution of bone marrow and long bone development in tetrapods likely occurred in different ways, with crown tetrapods having a columnar growth plate and stem tetrapods having globular elongation.
The paper explores how alcohol consumption and stress can dysregulate behavioral responses in mice. Mice that were given intermittent access to alcohol and then subjected to a stressful odor exhibited reduced burying behavior compared to mice that did not drink alcohol. The brain's dynorphin system, which involves the neuropeptide pro-dynorphin and its receptor kappa-opioid receptor, was found to play a key role in this behavioral response. Specifically, increasing the number of dynorphin-expressing neurons in the brain's bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and the activity of the BNST neurons was found to reduce burying behavior after alcohol exposure. The BNST neurons were found to be engaged in response to stress and alcohol exposure, with increased synaptic transmission and plasticity. The mPFC-BNST pathway was also found to be engaged after alcohol and stress exposure. Chemogenetic inhibition of the BNST mPFC pathway improved burying behavior in mice that drank alcohol. These findings suggest that targeting the BNST may be a potential therapeutic approach for improving stress coping in individuals with alcohol use disorder.
The paper describes a study on the protein eEF1A, which is an important factor in a process called heat shock response (HSR). eEF1A helps cells respond to stress by activating genes that encode molecular chaperones and other cytoprotective heat shock proteins. The researchers found that eEF1A isoform 1 (eEF1A1) is responsible for the rapid and synchronized production of HSP70 protein upon stress, while eEF1Aoform 2 (eEF1A2) does not. eEF1A1 binds to HSP70 mRNA during transcription and translation and helps to transport it from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it is translated efficiently. This allows eEF1A1 to synchronize the expression of HSP70 mRNA from transcription to translation, rendering the process robust and coordinated. The study provides insight into how eEF1A helps cells respond to stress by controlling each stage of HSP70 induction from transcription to translation. The findings suggest eEF1A as a promising target for the treatment of diseases associated with deregulated HSR, such as cancer and neurodegenerative conditions.
The paper discusses how the plant hormone auxin regulates flower development by controlling the activation of transcription factors. Auxin sensing triggers the chromatin remodeling complexes BRM and SYD to unlock compacted chromatin near target transcription factor loci, allowing additional transcription factors to access and activate their genes. The authors found that the chromatin remodeling ATPases BRM and SYD are essential for the auxin-dependent activation of genes involved in flower primordium initiation. They identified a mechanism where auxin-sensitive Aux/IAA proteins prevent the interaction between MP and the chromatin remodeling complexes, preventing the activation of target genes in the absence of the hormone. Tethering the chromatin remodeling complexes to MP target loci using a fusion protein mimics MP function and allows for the rescue of flower initiation defects in mutants. The chromatin remodeling complexes are also required to recruit MP targets genes.
The researchers created mice with a genetic mutation that deletes a part of a human chromosome called 7q2. This deletion affects the hematopoies of the mice in several ways. It leads to a bias towards making myeloid cells instead of lymphoid cells. The mice have a smaller bone marrow, lower spleen weight, and a higher proportion of hematopoietic stem cells that are biased towards myeloid differentiation. The mutation also impairs the ability of these stem cells to repopulate lymphoid cells. The mice have a higher proportion of CD150hi hematopoietic stem cells and a lower proportion of CD150lo hematopoietic stem cells, which leads to a myeloid bias. The researchers found that the deletion of 7q2 affects the genes located on chromosome 7q2, which are involved in regulating various cellular processes such as transcription, mitochondrial quality control, protein degradation, and DNA replication. The mice provide evidence that the deletion of 7q2 contributes to myeloid transformation in human myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia by impairing lymphoid differentiation and increasing the growth of haploinsufficient hematopoietic stem cells. The study suggests that the deletion of multiple genes in combination, rather than just one gene, likely leads to the observed hematopoietic abnormalities.
The study aimed to investigate the molecular organization of mouse sensory neurons using cell type-specific transcriptional profiling. They found that the three major populations of sensory neurons labeled by SNS-Cre, Parv-Cre, and IB4 were distinct and had different expression of ion channels, neurotransmitters, and transcription factors. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed at least 7 distinct subgroups within the SNS-Cre population, showing the heterogeneity of sensory neurons at the single-cell level. The subgroups identified were further characterized by co-expression of specific genes, expression of neuron-specific markers, and expression of transcripts that were not detectable in other populations. The study found new markers for known sensory neuron populations and identified novel subgroups of neurons that were not previously described. The results demonstrate the complexity of primary sensory neurons and highlight the need for more granular analysis to fully understand their function and connectivity.
This paper describes the discovery of a mechanism that regulates how chromosomes divide during cell division in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. The authors found that four related proteins called ZHP-1 through ZHP-4 play a key role in this process. These proteins are part of a signaling network that helps ensure that only one chromosome pair gets designated as the "winner" and divides first during cell division. They do this by limiting the number of recombination sites on each chromosome, which in turn affects the number of chromosomes that divide. The ZHP proteins localize to structures called synapsis initiation complexes, which form between homologous chromosomes, and are important for recombination. The ZHP proteins also localize to chromosomes themselves, where they help restrict recombination factors to a single site on each chromosome, which ensures that only one chromosome gets designated as the winner. This helps ensure proper chromosome division.
The paper discusses how the order of events during mitosis, specifically anaphase, is regulated by the dephosphorylation of proteins. The authors used mass spectrometry and live cell imaging to study how the destruction of a single protein, cyclin B, triggers a graded series of dephosphorylations whose rate is encoded in the system. They found that proteolysis plays a crucial role in initiating mitotic exit, while phosphatase activity is required for the orderly progression of events within the system. They propose a two-stage model where CDK-inhibited phosphatases first activate the APC/C, which then targets mitotic factors for destruction. The APC/C inhibition neither prevents dephosphorylation nor affects the order of events, suggesting that the minimal proteolytic requirement for mitotic exit is the destruction of cyclin B.
The paper describes how the protein Wfs1, which is associated with Wolfram syndrome, is expressed in layer 2/3 pyramidal cells in the prefrontal cortex and plays a role in regulating depressive behaviors in response to stress. Mice that lack Wfs1 in these cells exhibit increased sensitivity to stress and depressive behaviors, including increased immobility in a forced swim test. The study also shows that Wfs1 is required for normal ER function in these cells and that loss of Wfs1 leads to dysregulation of proteins that are important for synaptic function. The paper suggests that Wfs1-expressing neurons in the prefrontal cortex may be particularly sensitive to signals that regulate ER function and that loss of Wfs1 in these cells leads to impaired stress response.
The paper discusses how different ways of modulating the protein Hsp90, including point mutations, binding to cochaperone proteins, and macro-molecular crowding, can affect its function. The study shows that these different modulations produce similar steady-state distributions of open and closed conformations, but have different kinetics. The kinetics can be rationalized by the flexibility of Hsp90, which is important for its ATPase function. The study suggests that reducing non-productive flexibility stimulates the ATPase activity, and that conformational confinement plays an important role in protein regulation. The findings demonstrate that protein function is influenced by both thermodynamic and kinetic changes, and that non-specific interactions can have significant effects. The results suggest that in vitro experiments may overestimate the effects of protein mutations in vivo, and that crowding can easily mimic the effects of protein mutations. The study provides evidence that conformational confinement plays an important mechanistic role in protein regulation.
The paper describes how cells in yeast, which can form multiple buds, establish a single front or polarity site. The authors found that cells that slow the exchange of polarity factors between the cell interior and the plasma membrane are able to form multiple buds. This is because the slower exchange of factors allows clusters to persist for longer, allowing them to compete with other clusters. The winning cluster grows at the expense of the losing cluster. The authors propose that the presence of actin cables and septins does not stabilize the clusters, and that clusters are eliminated through competition between clusters. Slowing the exchange of factors also delayed the resolution of multi-cluster intermediates, allowing cells to make more than one bud. The findings suggest that the presence of multiple buds in yeast cells is due to competition between clusters, not a stabilizing factor. The paper provides insight into the mechanism by which yeast cells can ensure that only one front forms in the final state.
The paper describes experiments using single molecule FRET to study the RecA filament, which is a protein that plays a key role in repairing DNA damage. The authors found that the RecA filament slides along the DNA during homology search, which is the first step in DNA repair. This sliding allows the RecA filament to rapidly search for homologous sequences without dissociating from the DNA. They observed that RecA filament sliding can result in homology recognition and base pairing, which is a stochastic process. They found that even as little as 6 nucleotides of complementary base pairs are needed for homology recognition, and the efficiency of homology recognition increases with the length of the homology site. The authors conclude that sliding along the DNA can significantly enhance the rate of homology search, and that RecA filament sliding may play a role in rapid homology search mechanisms like Rad51.
The researchers determined the crystal and solution structures of the HMPV M2-1 protein, which is important for antitermination in pneumoviruses. They found that M2-1 exists in both open and closed conformations and that the closed conformation is induced by binding to adenosine-rich RNA. The M2-1 zinc finger recognizes adenine bases 5 and 6, while the core domain binds to the polyadenosine tract. The researchers propose a model where the zinc finger recognizes the gene end sequence and the core domain binds the polyadenosine tract. RNA binding induces the closure of the M2-1, which is coupled with aggregation into larger oligomers. The researchers showed that M2-1 exists in both open and closed states, which may allow it to bind non-specific RNA sequences and modulate the distance between the adenine tract and upstream sequence. This mechanism may allow M2-1 to detect gene ends and polyadenylate mRNA transcripts. The research provides insight into the mechanism of antitermination in the Pneumovirinae family of viruses.
The researchers developed a new DNA-based fluorescent probe called Clensor to measure chloride levels in the lysosomes of Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes. They showed that lysosomes have high chloride levels compared to extracellular chloride levels, and that lowering lysosomal chloride levels correlated with a loss of lysosomal degradation function. They found that lysomal chloride levels were significantly reduced in nematode models of lysosomal storage diseases and in human cell culture models of lysosomal storage disorders, with the magnitude of chloride decrease being much higher than the proton decrease. This suggests that chloride levels play a key role in regulating lysomal function. The researchers propose that chloride dysregulation may be a more sensitive indicator of lysomal dysfunction than hypoacidification, and that quantitative chloride imaging could provide a more sensitive measure of lysomal dysfunction in organisms as well as cell culture models derived from blood samples.
The paper discusses the ability of rhesus macaque monkeys to use eye gaze to shift attention to a target location. The researchers trained the monkeys to use head orientation to identify a spatial target when viewing a portrayed monkey's head, and then tested whether the monkeys actually used geometrical gaze following (gaze that aligns with the target) or learned associations between the portrayed monkey's head orientation and target location. They found that the monkeys did indeed use gaze following to shift attention, as evidenced by a specific patch of brain activity in the posterior temporal sulcus (GF patch) that was only found in the right hemisphere of one of the two monkeys. This GF patch was found to correspond to the part of the face patch network responsible for processing visual orientation, but not face identity. The researchers propose that this GF patch is the substrate for the geometrical calculations needed to translate head orientation into precise shifts of attention. They suggest that this region in the monkey brain is homologous to the pSTS of humans, which is involved in eye gaze following and is activated by head orientation and other cues. The study provides evidence that monkeys have a similar capacity for eye gaze following as humans, despite their reliance on learned associations between head orientation and target location in the first experiment.
The paper describes how mice that had their right eyes sutured shut at a young age (called monocular deprivation) were able to recover some of their visual function after being allowed to see with both eyes again (called binocular vision). The researchers found that running while viewing visual stimuli, but not just visual stimulation alone, helped the mice recover their visual function much faster. Specifically, running while viewing bars or noise helped the mice recover their closed-eye responses more than running while viewing only noise. The closed-eye responses recovered to normal levels with a stimulus-specific manner, while open-eye responses did not change much. The researchers also found that inhibitory neurons had reduced activity after monocular deprivation and this reduction helped allow the deprived-eye excitatory pathways to drive activity upon reopening. They propose that running enhances cortical plasticity by increasing neural activity.
This paper explores how the leaf-cutting ants Acromyrmex echinatior use inorganic chemistry, specifically the Fenton reaction, to break down plant material and feed it to their fungal cultivars. The ants collect and chew plant fragments and then deposit them on top of their fungal gardens to decompose them. The fecal fluid of the ants contains enzymes that produce hydrogen peroxide, which the fungus uses to break down the plant material. The ants have evolved mechanisms to reduce iron from the fungus back to iron, allowing the Fenton reaction to occur. The ants use glucose dehydrogenase to reduce iron and hydrogen peroxide to break plant cell walls and fungal laccase to produce hydroxyl radicals. This allows the fungus to degrade cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. The ants also use oxidoreductases to produce hydrogen peroxide. The study found that the fecal fluid contains high concentrations of glucose dehydrogenase and laccase, which suggest that the ants can use the fungus's laccase for this purpose. The ants use the fungus's aryl alcohol oxidases to produce hydrogen peroxide. The study found that the fecal fluid contains high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and the ability to degrade 2-deoxy-ribose, which supports the idea that the ants use Fenton chemistry. The ants have evolved mechanisms to avoid damaging their own tissues from the hydroxyl radicals produced by the Fenton reaction.
The paper discusses the role of the Greatwall kinase (GWL) in cancer. They found that GWL overexpression promotes cell transformation and tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. They showed that GWL overexpression leads to increased AKT phosphorylation on S47, which in turn promotes cell proliferation and invasion. They found that this effect is mediated by GWL's ability to degrade a protein called PHLPP, which inhibits AKT phosphorylation. GWL does not directly phosphorylate AKT. The paper suggests that GWL may be a potential tumor marker and target for cancer therapy.
The paper discusses how the new antibiotic drug BDQ affects human macrophages and macrophage function. BDQ induces cell reprogramming in macrophages, increasing their ability to fight bacterial infections. BDQ upregulates genes related to metabolism, lysosome biogenesis, acidification, and phagocytosis. It also increases the ability of macrophages to degrade lipids and activates the autophagy pathway, leading to enhanced bacterial killing. BDQ does not seem to directly affect mitochondrial function. BDQ also potentiates the activity of other anti-TB drugs, suggesting it could be useful in host-directed therapy. The study shows that BDQ's effects on macrophage function go beyond its antibacterial activity and may have potential as a new approach to fight antibiotic resistance.
The researchers used conditional Cre lines to inactivate the Hippo signaling protein YAP in the lung epithelium of mice. They found that loss of YAP activity in the distal airway leads to localized cystic lung abnormalities, while loss of YAP in the proximal airway does not disrupt lung development. They propose that changes in local epithelial cell properties mediated by YAP contribute to lung branching morphogenesis. YAP controls cellular contractility and mechanical force production, which in turn contribute to defective branching in the absence of YAP. The researchers identified new YAP targets that regulate pMLC levels and cortical contractility. The actin cytoskeleton does not directly generate mechanical force, but YAP regulates pMLC levels through a signaling network. The research provides new insights into how YAP controls cellular contractility and mechanical force production during lung development and how changes in epithelial properties contribute to lung abnormalities.
The researchers used cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography to visualize the type III secretion apparatus of Yersinia enterocolitica inside intact bacterial cells. They found that the secretin YscC and periplasmic domain YscD in the secretion complex are longer inside the cells than expected based on isolated structures, and that the basal body of the secretion complex is longer than predicted. The secretin YscC is thought to stretch the periplasmic domain YscD by 5 nm, which explains the observed length variation. They propose that this flexibility of the periplasmic domain YscD allows the basal body to cope with membrane stresses.
The paper describes how a protein called FER (FERONIA) is involved in controlling growth and development in plants. FER is essential for reproduction, participates in defense responses and interacts with several plant hormones. The authors found that two related proteins called LRE and LLG1 interact with FER and are required for its function. LRE and LLG1 are important for FER localization to the cell membrane. FER depends on LRE and LLG1 to be properly localized to the membrane in order to function. The authors propose that FER interacts with LRE and LLG1 to form a complex that is then delivered to the cell membrane. This complex may interact with other proteins and mediate various plant growth and defense responses. The paper shows that FER and LRE are required for similar plant growth and developmental phenotypes, indicating that they likely function together. The authors suggest that the complex of FER, LRE and LLG1 may act as a co-receptor for multiple plant hormone signals.
The paper describes a study comparing the chromatin structure and gene expression in the archaeon Halorubrum halobium volcanii. The authors used formaldehyde crosslinking to generate nucleosome-bound DNA fragments and RNA sequencing to determine the location of nucleosomes and transcripts. They found that the nucleosome occupancy is conserved between archaea and eukaryotes, with shorter periods in archaea due to their smaller genome size. They also found that the nucleosomes are depleted at transcription start sites (TSSs) and well-positioned nucleosomes at gene bodies, similar to eukaryotes. However, the nucleosomes at termination sites (TTSs) are less prominent. This suggests that the interplay between chromatin and transcription is conserved between archaea and eukaryotes. Additionally, they identified a novel transcript that contains a histone acetyltransferase domain, suggesting that rudimentary control over chromatin accessibility may occur in archaea. These findings suggest that chromatin structure and gene expression have evolved independently of the genome size. Overall, the study provides insights into the evolution of chromatin and its role in regulating gene expression.
The paper discusses how the availability of dietary protein and other nutrients rather than total calories may influence an organism's lifespan and behavior. The authors used Drosophila flies to investigate how the availability of protein and other nutrients affects their behavior and aging. They found that flies that were deprived of protein for a short time period of time showed a preference for protein-containing food when given the option, and that this preference was eliminated when the protein was reintroduced. They also found that flies that had reduced serotonin signaling in their brains, which is involved in protein valuation, lived longer. This suggests that the process of evaluating the value of individual nutrients and choosing the right amount of each may influence aging. The authors propose that the macronutrient valuation process itself, rather than just the total amount of food consumed, is a key factor in determining lifespan. They propose that peripheral amino acid sensors, like the SLC7A5 transporter JhI-21, may play a role in this valuation process.
The paper discusses how cancer cells have a high incidence of abnormal transcription readthrough, where the transcription of a gene extends beyond the annotated end of the gene. In kidney cancer cells, called clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), this occurs frequently. The authors found that high levels of transcription readthrough are associated with poor patient survival. They identified the histone methyltransferase SETD2 as a key gene that when mutated leads to this aberrant transcription pattern. They showed that ectopic expression of SETD2 can rescue the transcription termination defects in SETD2 mutant ccRCC cells. They also found that the effects of impaired transcription readthrough extend beyond the affected gene and contaminate the expression of neighboring genes, including the anti-apoptotic oncogene BCL2, which is commonly upregulated in ccRCC. They discovered recurrent RNA chimeras in ccRCC cells combining sequences from two tandem genes. These chimeric transcripts are generated by extending RNAPII beyond annotated gene boundaries and invasion of adjacent genes. The findings suggest that impaired transcription termination may play important roles in expanding the transcriptome diversity that drives cancer development and progression, and that chimeric transcripts may have functional roles.
The paper describes a study on the interactions between a protein called Glycoprotein Lipase LPL and Glycoprotein B1. Glycoprotein Lipase LPL is essential for lipid metabolism in the bloodstream, but its interactions with Glycoprotein B1 are not well understood. The study shows that Glycoprotein B1 has an acidic domain that is intrinsically disordered, unlike the rest of its structure. The acidic domain has a major effect on the association rate of Glycoprotein B1 with Lipoprotein Lipase. The acidic domain also preserves the catalytic activity of Lipoprotein Lipase by limiting unfolding of the catalytic domain. The paper also shows that two discrete interaction sites in the Lipoprotein Lipase-Glycoprotein B complex cooperate to promote ligand binding and stabilization of Lipoprotein Lipase activity. This model could help explain how Glycoprotein B1 mobilizes Lipoprotein Lipase in vivo.
The paper describes how a protein called TraR regulates transcription initiation in bacteria. It does this by interacting with the RNA polymerase complex and changing its conformation in a way that helps the RNA polymerase transcribe the DNA. The authors used cryo-electron microscopy to study how TraR interacts with the RNA polymerase complex and how this affects its ability to transcribe DNA. They found that TraR interacts with two parts of the RNA polymerase complex, βSi1 and βSi3, in different ways that help it activate or inhibit transcription. The βSi1 interaction weakens the interaction between RNA polymerase and a part called σ701, which is a barrier to transcription initiation. The βSi3 interaction opens up the RNA polymerase channel and allows the DNA to enter, but the βSi3 interaction also sterically blocks the DNA from entering the active site where the RNA polymerase adds nucleotides. The TraR-RNA polymerase complex dissociates before the RNA polymerase ejects the σ701. The authors propose a model that TraR dissociates from the complex before the RNA polymerase ejects the σ701, allowing the RNA polymerase to initiate transcription.
The paper describes a study that investigates the neural mechanisms by which the hormone ghrelin controls appetite and feeding behavior. Ghrelin is secreted in response to anticipation of food intake and crosses the blood-brain barrier to activate brain cells called ghrelin receptor expressing neurons in the ventral hypothalamus. These ghrelin-activated neurons then engage downstream orexin-expressing neurons in the dorsal perifornical lateral hypothal area, which in turn increase appetite and feeding behavior. The study shows that vagus nerve ghrelin-expressing neurons provide an exclusively ipsilateral input to the dorsal lateral hypothal area, and activate orexin-expressing neurons. The study also demonstrates that vagus nerve ghrelin signaling to the dorsal lateral hypothal area is required for ghrelin-mediated hyperphagia during meal entrainment schedules. The findings provide a novel model for how ghrelin engages conditioned appetite and feeding behavior through a neural pathway involving ghrelin-expressing neurons, ghrelin receptor activation, downstream orexin-expressing neurons, and central orexin signaling.
This paper analyzed data from a dengue fever outbreak in Fiji in 2013/14 to understand the transmission dynamics of the virus. The researchers collected paired serum samples from participants before and after the outbreak to examine the rise in in seroprevalence and risk factors associated with infection. They found that the highest infection rate was among children under 10 years old and the majority of reported cases were in the 20-29 age group, which suggests that reported cases may have been primary infections rather than secondary infections. The serological survey results suggested that fewer than 50% of participants under 20 had been infected in 2013, while most of those over 20 had evidence of infection. The modeling results showed that transmission dynamics were likely driven by herd immunity and climate variation, but an additional reduction in transmission due to a nationwide vector clean-up campaign in March 2014 was the main contributor to the decline in transmission. The model suggested that the effective reproduction number, R0, was around 1.2 during the outbreak, which could explain the observed incidence pattern. The results suggest that combining serological survey data with surveillance data can provide valuable insights into dengue transmission dynamics and forecasting.
The paper describes how the authors used a novel biosensor called Tpx-roGFP2 to study the thiol redox state in African trypanosomes, which lack glutathione-dependent peroxidases. They found that Tpx-roGFP2 responds to changes in the trypanothione redox couple, which is composed of thiol-disulfide pairs, and not the glutathione redox potential. Tpx-roGFP2 is most efficient at responding to thiol-disulfide pairs. The biosensor was expressed in the cytosol or mitochondria of the parasite, and showed that the mitochondria also has a trypanothione-based redox system with a slightly lower reducing capacity than the cytosol. Depletion of the thiol peroxidase Tpx in the cytosol resulted in reduced ability to respond to oxidative stress. This suggests that a small fraction of Tpx may reside in the mitochondria. The authors propose that a protein may mediate the transfer of thiol-disulfide pairs between the cytosol and mitochondria.
The paper investigated DNA methylation profiles in patients with Paget's disease of bone (PDB) and found that certain genes with roles in bone metabolism, immune responses, and cytoskeleton were differentially methylated between patients and controls. The analysis showed that methylation changes within regions of genes were more predictive of PDB than changes at individual sites, suggesting that methylation patterns may be useful as biomarkers for the disease. While methylation changes were not found in osteoclasts, which are the cells affected in PDB, some genes with immune functions were differentially methylated in both blood and bone tissue. The results suggest that epigenetic markers may be useful for identifying individuals at risk of developing PDB and potentially allowing early intervention. However, more work is needed to determine whether the observed methylation changes directly impact gene expression and whether they could be used as predictors. The study highlights the potential for methylation markers to be used in combination with genetic profiling to assess PDB risk.
The paper describes the discovery of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the early larval lymph gland of Drosophila. The larval lymph gland is found to contain HSCs that express markers like Notch, STAT, and BMP4 receptor, similar to vertebrate AGM-related HSCs. The HSCs are found to be niche dependent and rely on Dpp signaling from the hematopoietic niche for their maintenance. The study shows that the HSCs divide only in the first 20 hours after hatching and give rise to differentiated blood cells. The identification of HSCs in the early larval lymph gland provides a new model for understanding the early development and maintenance of HSCs in a simpler organism like Drosophila. This model can now be used to study the mechanisms of early HSC expansion and lineage commitment, which are still poorly understood in vertebrates. The study identifies a unique GEF called Trio that is expressed in HSCs and the niche cells, which could be used to explore its role in AGM-related HSC development. The finding of Notch expression adjacent to the anterior aorta also provides a new avenue for studying the temporal role of Notch in distinguishing between arterial and hematopoietic fates during development. The identification of HSCs in Drosophila brings about a paradigm shift in understanding of Drosophila hematopoies, providing insights into developmental and potential applications for stem cell therapies.
This paper describes a study on how the molecular mechanisms of alveolar formation in the lungs develop. The researchers found that a pathway called the planar cell polarity pathway (PCP) plays a key role in regulating the development of alveoli. The PCP pathway controls the secretion of a protein called platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) from alveolar type I and type II cells to fibroblasts/myofibroblasts. This secretion is required for the adequate number of fibroblasts/myofibblasts to form alveoli. The PCP pathway also controls the cell shape of alveolar type I cells and the migration of myofibroblasts. The researchers found that loss of the PCP pathway in alveolar epithelial cells leads to defective alveolar formation, while loss of the pathway in mesenchymal cells leads to loss of PDGF secretion. The study suggests that the PCP pathway operates in both the lung epithelium and mesenchyme and controls distinct aspects of cellular properties required for alveoli formation.
The paper discusses the role of protein synthesis quality control mechanisms in bacteria to prevent the incorporation of non-proteinogenic amino acids into proteins. Specifically, it investigates the ability of Escherichia coli tyrosine synthetases (PheRS) to discriminate between tyrosine and methionine and to edit methionine-tRNA. The authors find that while E. coli PheRS can efficiently edit methionine-tRNA, it cannot efficiently discriminate between tyrosine and methionine. This allows methionine to be incorporated into proteins at tyrosine codons, which can be toxic to the cell. They find that E. coli PheRS is essential for preventing the incorporation of methionine into proteins during oxidative stress conditions, as methionine accumulation under these conditions leads to reduced growth. They also show that yeast cytoplasmic PheRS lacks this editing activity and is unable to efficiently discriminate between tyrosine and methionine. The results suggest that while methionine accumulation may pose a threat to protein synthesis under certain conditions, its incorporation at tyrosine codons does not significantly affect protein function.
The paper describes how cells in the trachea of a fly larvae work together to form a continuous, hollow tube-like structure called the tracheal epithelium. The cells of the trachea work together to form a supracellular extracellular matrix called the apical chitin matrix, which is made of chitin and other materials. The chitin helps the cells form apical actin rings and taenidial folds that expand the diameter of the trachea. The apical actin rings are thought to prefigure the taenidial folds. The chitin synthesis enzyme Kv is localized at the apical surface of the cells and is required for the formation of the taenidial folds. The actin rings are also thought to help regulate the chitin deposition and the formation of the taenial folds. The cells of the trachea have cell-cell junctions that help coordinate the orientation of their apical actin bundles and ensure proper taenidial fold formation. The chitin matrix also helps regulate the activity of a protein called Src2A, which in turn helps form the apical actin rings. The study found that cells can adapt their orientation of their taenial folds to some degree even when neighboring cells have abnormal actin rings. The chitin matrix provides a feedback mechanism that helps maintain proper apical actin bundle organization and cell shape, and the cells coordinate their actin bundles via their cell-cell junctions.
The paper discusses a study on hierarchical decision making in monkeys and how it relates to a previous study on the topic. The previous study found that hierarchical decision making involves separate accumulators for each level of decision, rather than a single accumulator for all levels. The paper argues that this is supported by data showing that evidence at one level can influence decisions at the next level, and that the influence of evidence at one level on decisions at the next level is not simply the same as the influence of evidence at the next level. The previous study's model of hierarchical decision making, which assumed a single accumulator for all levels, was found to fail to accurately model the data. The authors argue that hierarchical decision making involves mechanisms that enable interactions between local selection signals, rather than a single source of inhibition, and that evidence can accumulate independently at different levels. They also show that humans have a limited capacity for parallel decision making, but can adapt their strategy as they become more proficient. They conclude that hierarchical decision making involves separate accumulators for each level, rather than a single accumulator for all levels, and that flat models lack the flexibility to account for this.
The paper discusses how humans may encode and represent reward probabilities associated with novel stimuli in a shared neural code that runs from "bad" to "good" in the brain. They argue that this neural code is based on an abstract concept of magnitude, rather than simply encoding the stimulus value or certainty. They find that when humans are presented with high-dimensional visual images with high payout probabilities, the neural signals evoked by those images are more similar to the neural codes elicited by larger numbers, while signals for lower payout probabilities are more similar to those elicited by lower numbers. This suggests that an abstract concept of magnitude is used to encode reward probabilities, rather than a lookup table in reinforcement learning models. This shared neural code may promote faster and more effective learning of new relational structures, allowing humans to generalize more quickly to new stimuli. The authors also simulate this idea using a neural network that shows that the shared structure facilitates faster retraining on new stimuli.
The paper discusses how Salmonella enterica's ability to increase its virulence in the mouse model organism is controlled by a type III secretion system called SPI-2. The two key regulators of this system are SsrA and SsrB. The authors found that when Salmonella enters the vacuole of the macrophage, the pH drops to around 5.2, which activates SsrB and increases the levels of SsrA and SsrB. Higher levels of SsrB molecules then increase the expression of genes in the SPI-2 locus. They found that SsrB becomes more acid-sensitive and binds more tightly to DNA at low pH, which increases its affinity for DNA. They propose that the acidic environment of the vacuole promotes the interaction of SsrB with DNA, leading to the activation of SPI-2 genes. They also found that SsrB undergoes a conformational change that increases its affinity for DNA. They propose that this conformational change is the key factor that allows SsrB to increase its binding to DNA and promote the activation of SPI-2 genes.
This paper describes a new approach called optogenetics that uses light to control the activity of specific proteins in cells. The researchers used this technique to study how the Ras protein and its associated proteins, called RalB, contribute to cancer cell invasion. They created cells that could be activated by blue light to turn on RalB activity. They found that RalB, but not RalA, is necessary for cancer cell invasion. They showed that light-activated RalB triggers the recruitment of an important protein complex called the Wave Regulatory Complex, which stimulates actin polymerization and cell protrusion. They found that the RalB pathway is the main driver of cancer cell invasion in these cells, while MAPK and PI3K pathways are not required. They also found that RalB protein levels increase in cancer cells as the disease progresses, suggesting it may be an important target for cancer therapy. Overall, their findings suggest that inhibiting the RalB-Ras-RalGEF pathway may be a promising cancer treatment strategy.
The paper studies how different proteins affect the growth and dynamics of actin filaments. Actin filaments are important for cellular processes like cell migration and mechanics. The researchers used total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to observe the filaments and measure their growth rates and pauses. They found that different proteins that bind to the filaments at the ends, called side-binding proteins, alter the filament growth rates. The barbed end grows faster and the pointed end pauses more. The side-binding proteins also change the filament flexibility and filament association rates. The researchers propose that the differences in filament growth rates arise from changes in the filament structure caused by the binding of the side-binding proteins. The paper suggests that the observed differences in filament growth and pauses are not just due to surface or light-induced effects, but rather changes in the filament structure. The study provides evidence that side-binding proteins can directly alter actin filament dynamics.
The paper describes a new method called fastFISH that allows researchers to detect nascent RNA transcripts in real-time at the single-molecule level. The method uses probes composed of just three or four nucleotides that are designed to hybridize specifically with RNA targets and probes. By self-quenching the probes, the background fluorescence from free probes is reduced, allowing the use of concentrations up to 1 micromolar. The fastFISH probes are able to detect nascent RNA transcripts with an on-rate of 107 M-1s-1. The authors demonstrate the method by using fastFISH to study the transcription cycle of the single-subunit T7 RNAP. They show that the dwell time between RNAP binding and probe binding is consistent with the expected transcriptional events, indicating that the probes detect specific capture of nascent RNA. The fastFISH probes can be used to dissect the dynamics of the transcription cycle and coupling of transcriptional steps to downstream events. The method should be useful for detecting endogenous RNAs in situ and in vivo and building nucleic acid nanostructures.
The paper discusses the role of histone mutations that block methylation of lysine residues in cancer. The authors study found that histone H3K9M mutations, which block methylation of lysine 9, result in the failure of histone methyltransferases to spread to other regions, leading to reduced methylation of the entire genome. They used yeast as a model organism to study this mechanism in detail. They found that the mutant H3K9 histones trap histone methyltransferase Clr4 at heterochromatin nucleation centers, preventing its spread to other regions. The interaction between H3K9M and Clr4 is mediated by the SET domain of Clr4, which is similar to the interaction between H3K9M and the SET domain of histone methyltransferases. The authors determined the crystal structure of G9a histone methyltransferase in complex with the H3K9M peptide, showing that methionine occupies a similar position and interacts with aromatic residues. They found that altering the side chain of H3K9M, such as substituting methionine with norleucine, enhances its interaction with Clr4. The results suggest that trapping of Clr4 by H3K9M is the key mechanism by which H3K9M inhibits methylation. The authors propose several ways to detoxify the effects of H3K9M, including reducing Clr4 levels, altering histone ratios, and tipping the balance between heterochromatin assembly and disassembly.
This paper describes the discovery of a new mechanism of transcriptional regulation by the protein JMJD6. JMJD6 was found to cleave a protein called MePCE, which is part of the 7SK snRNP complex that helps regulate transcription. The 7SK snRNP complex has proteins like CDK9 and HEXIM1. JMJ6 binds to the newly transcribed RNA close to the paused Pol II and cleaves MePCE, releasing P-TEFb. This allows P-TEFb to be recruited to the C-terminal domain of Pol II, which then phosphorylates the Ser2-CTD of Pol II. This release of P-TEFb from the 7SK snRNP complex is essential for Pol II transcription. The discovery of JMJD6's cleavage of MePCE helps explain why growth of cells without Jmjd6 is severely compromised, as JMJD6 is essential for the release of P-TEFb from the 7SK snRNP complex. The findings provide a novel transcription regulation pathway for genes regulated by promoter-proximal pausing of Pol II.
The paper investigates the role of a protein called ZCWP1 in the process of meiosis. ZCWP1 is found to be highly conserved across species and co-evolves with a protein called PRDM9, which binds to specific regions of chromosomes. ZCWP1 is found to be recruited to regions bound by PRDM9, likely due to the dual histone marks H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 that PRDM9 deposits. ZCWP1 is required for proper repair of broken chromosomes and synapsis of homologous chromosomes, but it does not seem to position broken chromosomes. Instead, it likely marks locations where repair proteins will bind. ZCWP1 is found to be required for proper repair of broken chromosomes, but it does not seem to position broken chromosomes. ZCWP1 is found to be required for proper repair of broken chromosomes, but it does not seem to position broken chromosomes. ZCWP1 is found to be required for proper repair of broken chromosomes, but it does not seem to position broken chromosomes. ZCWP1 is found to be required for proper repair of broken chromosomes, but it does not seem to position broken chromosomes.
The paper describes how the non-coding RNA protein Xist, which is derived from a retroviral element, evolved to recruit the protein Spen in order to carry out chromosome dosage compensation. Spen binds to both Xist RNA and ERVK RNAs, leading to chromosome silencing. The authors show that Spen binds to ERK RNAs through a similar mechanism as it binds to Xist RNA, using the same structural features. They propose that the insertion of an ERV element into Xist may have provided the initial functionality for Xist to silence the entire chromosome. Experiments show that Xist-ERV, a chimeric RNA made by inserting an ERV element into the Xist locus, is able to recruit Spen and mediate local chromosome silencing, but not Xist-ERV expression. This suggests that the ERV insertion into Xist led to the evolution of Xist's functionalities for silencing the entire chromosome. The results provide evidence that non-coding RNAs, which are young and evolved from transposable elements, can acquire protein binding domains through interactions with proteins, allowing them to carry out new functions.
The paper discusses the role of the kinesin-4 protein KIF21B in regulating the dynamics of microtubules in T cells. KIF21B is found to be important for regulating microtubule growth and preventing excessive microtubule elongation, which in turn is essential for proper centrosome polarization and immunological synapse formation. The authors show that KIF2B knockout mice exhibit defects in centrosome polarization, including smaller synapses and slower synapse formation, which can be rescued by mildly perturbing microtube growth with a microtubule-destabilizing drug. They also use computational modeling to show that a small number of KIF2B molecules is sufficient to restrict microtube length, which in turn inhibits excessive microtube elongation and enables centrosome polarization. The simulations suggest that KIF2B acts as a force-generating motor that induces pauses in microtubles, which then detaches and binds to the next growing microtuble, inducing shrinkage. The study highlights the importance of KIF2B in maintaining microtube dynamics and organization in T cells, which is distinct from its role in neurons where it reduces microtube growth processivity.
The paper discusses how the presence of self-sperm in hermaphrodites protects from the negative impact of sexual encounters with males. Previous studies showed that males shorten the lifespan of hermaphrodites, but the exact mechanism was unknown. The authors discovered that young hermaphrodites are resistant to this effect due to their self-sperm, while middle-aged hermaphrodites are not. They found that self-sperm acts through a sperm-sensing pathway to protect the soma from the negative impact of males. The presence of self-sperm can protect hermaphrodites, even in species other than C. elegans, as it can regulate chromatin and transcriptional networks. This mechanism may be leveraged to improve the reproductive success of hermaphrodites by allowing them to fertilize their own eggs and mate with another male later in life. The authors propose that the sperm-sensing pathway may be a conserved mechanism that could be harnessed to protect other species from the negative impact of sexual interactions.
This paper investigates how Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacteria that causes tuberculosis, utilizes nitrogen sources. The authors found that Mycobacterium tuberculosis can take up and metabolize all 20 proteinogenic amino acids as nitrogen sources, while NH4+ is only utilized at low concentrations. They used stable isotope labeling and metabolomics to show that Glu, Gln, Asp, and Ala are the most efficient nitrogen sources for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, while NH4+ has only moderate labelling. They also found that Asn is not utilized as a nitrogen source, and Glu is hydrolyzed to produce Ala. Growth on amino acid-containing media was faster than NH4+, suggesting that Mycobacterium tuberculosis can co-metabolize multiple nitrogen sources. The results suggest that Mycobacterium tuberculosis has evolved to utilize multiple nitrogen sources and this makes it difficult to target nitrogen metabolism for drug discovery. The ability to utilize different nitrogen sources may also indicate that Mycobacterium tuberculosis is an opportunistic pathogen that has adapted to persist in the human host.
The paper describes the discovery of a new spliced variant of the HIF-3α transcription factor, Hif-3α2, which is expressed constitutively under both normoxia and hypoxia. While full-length Hif-3α is rapidly degraded under normoxia, Hif-3α2 is stable and activates HRE-dependent transcription. However, the two proteins have different activities: Hif-3α2's transcriptional activity is weaker than that of full-length Hif-3α. Hif-3α2 regulates LR asymmetry development in zebrafish embryos by destabilizing the nuclear β-catenin complex, which is a key component of the Wnt signaling pathway. This action is independent of its transcriptional activity and does not require its HRE-dependent transcriptional activity. Hif-3α2 inhibits canonical Wnt signaling by destabilizing β-catenin, which is mediated by different mechanisms than the mechanisms reported for full-length HIF-1α and HIF-2α. The study shows that Hif-3α2 has a novel mechanism of regulating Wnt signaling that is distinct from the mechanisms reported for full-length HIF-1α and HIF-2α.
This paper investigates how stem cells in the C. elegans niche exit the niche. It was previously believed that a bare region extended over most of the progenitor zone and Sh1 cells contacted only differentiating germ cells. The authors discovered that Sh1 cells extend much farther distally than previously thought, contacting putative stem cells in the progenitor zone. Sh1 cells promote germ cell proliferation and differentiate germ cells by competing with the DTC niche. Sh1 cells are not required for germ cell differentiation, but instead promote differentiation indirectly by positioning germ cells in a way that allows them to escape the DTC's influence. This allows germ cells to differentiate. The authors propose a model where germ cells at the DTC-Sh1 interface divide asymmetrically, with one daughter remaining anchored to the DTC and the other becoming enwrapped by Sh1. The study highlights the importance of studying the progenitor zone and how it is regulated in vivo to understand how stem cells exit the niche. The results have implications for how niches regulate stem cell renewal and differentiation in other systems.
The paper presents a detailed analysis of how biological molecules like proteins, nucleic acids, and metabolites behave in real cellular environments. The authors built a comprehensive cytoplasmic model based on Mycoplasma genitalium and used molecular dynamics simulations to study how these molecules interact with each other and the surrounding cellular components. They found that cellular environments reduce the diffusion of molecules, but also lead to native state destabilization of some proteins and metabolites due to non-specific interactions with other molecules. They observed that electrostatic interactions between metabolites and proteins and ionic solvation effects are important factors. The simulations showed that weak associations between enzymes and other biological molecules occur more frequently in the cell than previously thought, and that metabolites interact extensively with surfaces of other molecules, reducing their free diffusion. The results suggest that cellular environments have evolved to maximize the number of metabolites in close proximity, which likely enhances metabolic rates. The study highlights the importance of considering the full cellular environment when interpreting in vitro data and the potential of whole-cell models to connect genotype to phenotype at the molecular level.
This paper describes experiments and computer simulations that aim to better understand the mechanism of hemifusion in influenza virus, a process by which the virus merges with a target membrane to enter a cell. The experiments showed that the virus merges with the target membrane through an extended intermediate state that is stable for at least a minute or more, even at low pH. This extended intermediate is rate-limited by the release of a fusion peptide from its pre-fusion pocket, which is then inserted into the target membrane by multiple fusion peptides from multiple fusion trimers. The simulations confirmed that the number of fusion peptides inserted into the target membrane is the key factor limiting the hemifusion reaction. The number of fusion peptides inserted determines the rate constant, while the actual number of fusion trimers involved determines the number of rate-limiting rearrangements. The simulations showed that the extended intermediate state is likely to be stable for at least a minute or more, which could make it a useful target for an entry inhibitor. The paper proposes that the extended intermediate state may be analogous to the extended form of the gp41 fusion protein of HIV, which is the only clinically approved entry inhibitor.
The paper describes how the authors used a combination of two-photon optogenetics and whole-cell patch clamp recordings to investigate the functional connectivity and short-term dynamics of recurrent excitatory synapses in the adult mouse and human visual cortex. They found that excitatory neurons in the cortex exhibit recurrent connectivity, but the rate of recurrent connectivity varies between cell types. They used two-photon optogenetics to sample connectivity at distances beyond what is possible with multipatch recordings, finding that recurrent connections are sparse and dominated by short-term synaptic depression, except for connections between Sim1 neurons. The authors also found that the distance-dependent connectivity profiles of excitatory neurons fall off with distance, consistent with the expected connectivity patterns based on the spatial distribution of axons and dendrites. The authors analyzed the connectivity data to identify cell-type-dependent differences and mechanisms contributing to short-term plasticity, and used a model to capture the functional connectivity and dynamics of recurrent excitatory synapses. They found that recurrent connectivity is a general feature of excitatory neurons that is regulated depending on the target region. The results provide insights into the cortical circuit and suggest that high rates of recurrent connectivity may be counterbalanced by short-term dynamics and/or inhibitory feedback.
The paper describes a study on how neurons in the brain called P1 neurons control aggressive behavior in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Previous studies showed that P1 neurons promote male courtship behavior, but the authors found that when they were activated, flies also exhibited aggressive behavior towards other males. The authors identified three P1 neuron-expressing lines that showed increased aggression, but not wing extension, and found that activation of just a few P1 neurons was sufficient. They used optogenetic stimulation to control the activity of P1 neurons and found that at low frequencies, activation of P1 neurons promoted aggression but not wing extension, while higher frequencies of stimulation promoted wing extension. This suggests that P1 neurons have different activation thresholds for controlling the two behaviors. The authors propose two models for how P1 neurons control aggression and courtship. One model is that P1 neurons directly activate separate circuitry for each behavior, while the other model is that P1 neuron activity triggers a persistent internal state that facilitates either aggression or courtship. The study suggests that P1 neurons may play a common role in controlling aggressive and courtship behaviors and that the decision to mate or fight is controlled by a higher-level module in the brain.
This paper investigates the role of meiotic recombination in the Arabidopsis thaliana genome. The authors generated meiotic tetrads by crossing a Col-Ler hybrid in a quartet1 background and then crossing the resulting F1 hybrids to a male sterile Cvi mutant. They sequenced the genomes of the tetrads and DH lines to identify recombination events and measure the frequency of gene conversions, called non-crossover conversion genomic conversions (NCO-GCs). They found that NCO-GCs are more frequent than expected and are associated with open chromatin regions and specific sequence motifs. They also identified that meiotic recombination is associated with the enrichment of poly-A motifs and nucleosome-free regions. They found that NCO-GCs are more likely to occur in gene promoter regions and are less likely to occur in gene bodies. They conclude that meiotic recombination is an effective mechanism to generate new allele combinations and copy number variants, which could have significant potential for shaping the A. thaliana genome.
The paper investigates how muscle fatigue affects the acquisition of motor skills. It finds that muscle fatigue has a detrimental effect on learning motor skills that requires precise force control, specifically tasks that require high motor control. Even after participants have stopped fatiguing themselves, fatigued individuals still have impaired learning compared to those who did not fatigue themselves. The fatigue effect persists over multiple days, and takes twice as long for fatigued individuals to reach the same level of performance as non-fatigued peers. The authors conclude that fatigue has a domain-specific effect on motor learning and that this effect is at least partially mediated by changes in the brain's central motor cortex. This suggests that fatigue can significantly impact performance in tasks that require precise force control, such as musical performance, sports training, and rehabilitation programs for patients with neurological conditions. The findings highlight the importance of considering fatigue during training regimens to improve motor function.
This paper describes a new microscopy-based assay that allows researchers to visualize and quantify DNA double-strand break resection in single living cells in the fission yeast species Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The assay involves creating a specific double-stranded break near a gene called Mmf1 and using an endonuclease to generate a site-specific double-stranded break. The resulting double-stranded DNA is then visualized by a focus of a protein called Rad52-mCherry that forms at the break site. By tracking cell lineages over time, the researchers found that cells with mutations in genes that inhibit double-strand break resection have much faster resection rates, up to 20 times faster than cells without the mutations. They found that the inhibitors of resection, specifically genes called Crb2 and Rad9, specifically shift the mechanism of resection from the Exo1-dependent pathway to the RecQ helicase-dependent pathway. This suggests that loss of these inhibitors allows for faster resection rates through the RecQ helicase pathway, which may lead to increased genome instability. The results provide new insights into how loss of these genes allows cancer cells to become resistant to DNA repair inhibitors.
This paper investigates the concept of "conditionally functional variation" in Caenorhabditis elegans, a nematode worm, where genetic mutations have different effects depending on the genetic background of the organism. The authors found that there are many genetic variations that affect the probability of embryonic lethality when a gene is knocked down, depending on the genetic background of the worm. They identified 29 genes that cause embryonic lethality when knocked down, and found that the effects vary depending on the genetic background of the worm. They found that some genetic variations affect many genes, while others affect only a few. They also found that some genetic variations have effects that are only seen under conditions where a gene is knocked down, and not under normal conditions. This suggests that there are many hidden genetic variations that affect gene function, but are only revealed when a gene is knocked down. The study demonstrates that genetic background plays a big role in determining how genetic mutations affect gene function.
This paper investigates the possibility that microbial cells in a culture can differentiate into metabolically distinct subpopulations, where some cells specialize in producing acetate and others in detoxifying it. The authors used fluorescent protein reporters to measure gene expression in individual Bacillus subtilis cells to identify subpopulations that produce acetate and those that produce acetoin, a pH-neutral metabolite that detoxifies acetate. They found that cells that produce acetate early in growth transiently differentiate into cells that produce acetoin later. This acetate/acetoin switch occurs during exponential phase when acetate levels rise and become toxic. The authors suggest that this allows cells to avoid potential metabolic incompatibilities and optimize enzyme and substrate scaling for efficient conversion. They also found that the sucC gene, which is involved in acetate production, is controlled by the competence system, which is a gene regulatory circuit that stochastically activates differentiation in individual cells. This allows cells to switch between metabolic states in response to environmental cues, enabling the population as a whole to withstand unforeseen challenges. The results suggest that metabolic heterogeneity can be advantageous in microbial populations, enabling them to better adapt to changing conditions.
The paper discusses how recombination proteins are recruited to sites of recombination following replication fork collapse at a recombination-activating locus (RTS1). The researchers found that Rad52 is recruited to RTS1 within 7-12 minutes after replication fork blockage, indicating that recombination proteins are recruited to RTS1 within 7-12 minutes of replication fork blockage. However, the duration of Rad52 focus co-localizing with lacO-Lac focus at RTS1 is 3-4 minutes, indicating that some recombination occurs before fork convergence. This suggests that recombination proteins are recruited to RTS1 within 7-12 minutes after replication fork blockage. Deleting ori-1253, which is the most efficient origin on the centromere-proximal side of RTS1 firing in 84% of S-phases, resulted in increased recombination at RTS1. This indicates that early convergence does not mask the detection of recombination. The restarted forks are prone to perform a U-turn at small inverted repeats within 2 kb downstream of the barrier and are therefore capable of recombination. The frequency of direct repeat recombination at sites A and B downstream of RTS1 increased with RTS1-AO, indicating that restarted forks remain capable of recombination over a distance of at least 1.4 kb from their point of initiation. The researchers propose that the rapid induction of recombination following replication fork collapse at RTS1 is likely to ensure that genome duplication is completed in a timely manner, especially at fragile sites where replication forks are late in S-phase.
This paper analyzed genomic data from a group of Mexican American families to study non-crossover (NCO) gene conversion events in meiosis. NCOs are a type of recombination that reshuffles genetic material between homologous chromosomes, but they are less frequent than crossing over (COs). The authors found that NCOs occur at a rate of about 5.9 x 10^-6 per meiosis, which is consistent with previous estimates. They identified 103 putative NCO sites using genotype array data and whole genome sequencing data, and found that about 75% of these sites exhibit a bias towards transmitting the GC allele. They also observed that complex NCO events, where multiple NCO tracts occur within a short distance of each other, are more common than previously thought. They identified 15 regions with NCO events, some of which exhibit clustered NCO tracts within a short distance. They found that the long-range NCO tracts are likely to be discontinuous rather than double COs. The results provide evidence that gBGC, a mechanism that favors the transmission of the GC allele, is operating in mammalian NCO events. The authors suggest that understanding the mechanisms behind NCOs could improve population genetic models and help explain the distribution of genetic variation.
The authors investigated how the disordered C-terminal tails of XRCC4 and XLF proteins affect DNA repair. They found that XRCC4 and XLF independently of LIG4 function to form complexes that bridge broken DNA during non-homologous end joining. However, simultaneously phosphorylating the disordered tails of both XRCC and XLF inhibits their ability to form DNA-bridging complexes, indicating that the tails are required for this function. This suggests that dismantling of XRCC-XLF complexes after repair is a critical step in non-homologous end joining. The authors propose that the disruption of XRCC-XLF complexes after repair is tightly regulated by phosphorylation of the disordered tails of both proteins, possibly by DNA-PK/ATM.
The paper discusses a new function of the protein p21 in regulating DNA replication during the S phase of the cell cycle. The authors found that p21 levels in cycling cells are too low to inhibit CDK activity, but they still regulate DNA replication by interacting with PCNA. When p21 is depleted, alternative DNA polymerases like Polκ are recruited to replication factories, leading to DNA replication stress and genomic instability. This suggests that p21's ability to interact with PCNA is key to its function in DNA replication. The authors propose that p21 acts as a positive regulator of DNA replication during unperturbed S phase, controlling the choice of polymerases and preventing the misuse of Polκ. They demonstrate this function in U2OS cells and human primary cells, showing that p21 depletion leads to increased origin firing and DNA replication stress, which is transmitted to the next cell cycle.
The paper presents structural insights into the human protein kinase 1 (hPINK1) and its orthologue Tribolium castaneum (TcPINK1). The authors found that TcPINK1 has a distinct structure compared to human PINK1, lacking the first kinase domain insertion. This allowed them to study how TcPINK1 recognizes and phosphorylates its substrates, which in turn helps understand how hPINK1 mutations causing Parkinson's disease work. They found that a unique insertion in the C-terminal extension of TcPINK1, called Ins2, and autophosphorylation of a key residue Ser205, together contribute to recognizing and binding to ubiquitin and Parkin substrates. They also found that the Ins2 loop is important for maintaining the active conformation of TcPINK1. Using cells expressing hPINK1, they showed that loss of function mutations in the ATP-binding region and the C-terminal extension of hPINK1, similar to those found in patients, abolished phosphorylation of ubiquitin and Parkin. This provides molecular insights into how hPINK1 mutations cause disease and may guide future drug discovery efforts.
The paper discusses how mast cells, a type of immune cell, play a key role in the development of vascular leakage during dengue fever. Dengue fever is a viral infection that can cause vascular leakage and hemorrhaging in some cases. The researchers found that mast cells are activated early during cutaneous infection with dengue virus and release vasoactive factors that cause vascular leakage. They showed that mast cells are necessary for the development of vascular leakage in mouse models of dengue fever. They also found that high levels of a mast cell-specific protein in human serum, called chymase, were associated with severe vascular leakage in dengue patients. The researchers suggest that mast cell activation may be a useful biomarker for predicting severe dengue fever and that drugs that target mast cells or their products may help limit vascular leakage and vascular pathology.
This paper explores how missense mutations in the protein GFAP (glialactic acidic protein) in the brain of patients with Alexander disease (AxD) affects the protein's function. GFAP is the main component of intermediate filaments in astrocytes and is the sole genetic cause of Alexander disease. The researchers found that missense mutations in GFAP that affect 70 different residues cause defects in the protein's filament organization and proteostasis. They identified a critical phosphorylation site on GFAP that is selectively upregulated in the brain tissues of patients who died very young, and promotes GFAP aggregation and perinuclear accumulation. In the in vitro model of Alexander disease, the researchers found that phosphorylation of this site in GFAP leads to caspase cleavage, which is a new marker for the most severe form of the disease. The researchers propose that monitoring the levels of this phosphorylation site in addition to total GFAP may provide added sensitivity for detecting disease activity. They also suggest that the phosphorylation of this site may promote the cleavage of GFAP, but the exact mechanism is still unclear. The study provides a basis for exploring protein tyrosine modification-based diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for Alexander disease.
The paper proposes using mobile phones as acoustic sensors to map mosquito populations. The authors show that mobile phones can be used to collect mosquito wingbeat sounds and classify them into different species using machine learning algorithms. They demonstrate this by recording mosquito sounds in the lab and field using mobile phones and comparing them to known mosquito species distributions. They show that the mobile phones can detect mosquito wingbeats up to 50 mm away, and that the frequency distributions of mosquitoes within a species are sufficient to distinguish them from other species. They also show that including metadata like location and time of recording can improve classification accuracy. They propose using a citizen science approach where volunteers can collect mosquito data using mobile phones and pool the recordings to create spatio-temporal maps of mosquito distributions. This approach has the potential to greatly increase the scale and resolution of mosquito surveillance efforts, particularly in resource-constrained areas, and could be used to screen for invasive or exotic species. The authors hope that this approach could be used to inform mosquito control strategies tailored to a given location.
This paper investigates how a positively selecting self-peptide (a peptide that selectively binds to a specific T cell receptor) can shape the post-selection T cell repertoire of CD4+ cells. The authors constructed a mouse model where a single peptide, gp250, was linked to the MHC class II beta chain to selectively present it to CD4+ T cells in the thymus. They found that this resulted in a large number of CD4+ T cells expressing the Vα1+ TCR, which was the dominant TCR for recognizing the model antigen cytochrome c. The Vα1+ TCRs had conserved CDR3 features, including serine at position 9, which was also found in a high frequency in the gp250-selected CD4+ cells. This suggests that the positively selecting self-peptide gp250 favors the selection of TCRs with these conserved CDR3 features. The results provide new insights into how a positively selecting self-peptide can shape the post-selection T cell repertoire and generate a T cell response with desired antigen specificities.
This paper investigated how the brain's representation of the missing hand changes after amputation. Previous studies showed that the brain maps the missing hand in a way that reflects the original hand's position and function, even after many years without sensory input. The researchers tested this by scanning the brains of 2 amputees with 7T ultra high-field MRI, allowing them to see the details of the brain's topography in the missing hand area. They found that the maps of the missing hand were still present and consistent with the original hand's maps, despite the lack of sensory input from the missing hand. They also tested an amputee with a brachial plexus avulsion injury, which abolished peripheral inputs, and found the missing hand maps still existed. This suggests that the brain's topography of the missing hand is not maintained by peripheral inputs but rather by central nervous system processing itself. The researchers conclude that the brain's organization of the missing hand area is preserved even after sensory loss, which could help develop intuitive control of neuroprosthetics for amputees.
The paper discusses the role of two splicing factors called Esrps in regulating gene expression in epithelial cells. The authors created mice with genetic knockouts of Esrps and analyzed their embryonic development and skin phenotypes. They found that loss of one or both Esrps resulted in different types and degrees of alternative splicing events, which led to various developmental defects. They also found that loss of Esrps resulted in changes in gene expression, including upregulation of genes involved in epithelial cell differentiation and barrier function. The authors conclude that Esrps play a critical role in regulating epithelial cell development and function through their regulation of alternative splicing events, and that their loss leads to defects in epithelial cells and organs.
This paper presents results from four studies that investigate the relationship between the hormone Leptin-Chromostatin 2 (LCN2) and appetite regulation in humans. The studies found that LCN2 levels increase postprandially in healthy humans, with the largest increase seen in lean subjects. LCN2 levels correlated with a decrease in hunger sensation, indicating that LCN2 may play a role in appetite suppression. However, LCN2 postprandial response was blunted in individuals with obesity. The extent of the postprandial LCN2 increase varied with body mass index (BMI), with women having the largest response and obese individuals showing a negative response. These results suggest that the LCN2-induced appetite suppression is conserved across species and species. However, the postprandial LCN2 response was blunted in obese humans, indicating that LCN2 may be a potential treatment for obesity. The studies used different meal types and macronutrient compositions, which could affect the magnitude of the LCN2 response. While the postprandial LCN2 increase was larger in humans compared to mice, the difference may be due to differences in meal composition and food intake patterns. The results suggest that LCN2 could be developed into a treatment for obesity.
This paper explores how the brain encodes information about the position of walls during wall-tracking behavior in mice. The authors used a tactile virtual reality system that allowed mice to track walls in a winding corridor, and used neural recordings and optogenetic manipulation to investigate how the brain processes this information. They found that neural activity in the barrel cortex, a brain region involved in whisker-based navigation, is necessary for guiding locomotion based on whisker cues. They showed that neural activity in layer 4 of the barrel cortex can drive a behavior resembling wall tracking, and that wall distance can be coded in spike rates in barrel cortex neurons. They also found that some neurons have monotonic tuning curves that tiled the relevant wall distances, while others have more complex, non-monotonic tuning curves. The authors propose that multiple mechanisms may contribute to the non-monotonic tuning curves, including cross-columnar inhibition and short-term synaptic plasticity. Their findings suggest that the barrel cortex encodes information about wall position and velocity, which in turn supports the mice's ability to track walls during locomotion.
The paper discusses how protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor (PIT) therapy can induce tolerance in CD4 T cells by silencing their ability to produce cytokines. The researchers found that PIT can induce long-term expression of a protein called PD-1 on CD4 T cells, which is important for their ability to be unresponsive to antigens. They showed that PD-1 expression is maintained in CD4 T cells that have been exposed to PIT, but not in CD4 T cells that have not been exposed to PIT. This suggests that PIT-induced PD-1 expression is responsible for the tolerance. The researchers found that PIT-induced PD-1 expression is associated with demethylation of a gene promoter region called Pd1. This demethylation is required for PD-1 expression and is achieved through the activity of TET proteins, which oxidize 5-methylcytosine to form 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. The demethylation of the Pd1 promoter allows the CD4 T cells to maintain long-term expression of PD-1, which is important for their tolerance.
The paper discusses evidence of early forager use of wild grasses and grains in the Balkans region of Europe. The researchers analyzed dental calculus from 61 Mesolithic individuals and grinding stones from 44 sites in the Danube Gorges area. They found evidence of starch granules from grasses of the Tritice tribe, including Aegilops, Avena, and Panicea, indicating that foragers were consuming wild grasses and grains as far back as 950 cal BCE. The starch granules were found in the dental calculus of individuals dating to the Early Mesolithic, Middle Mesolithic, and Late Mesolithic/Neolithic periods, indicating that the use of wild grains predated the arrival of Neolithic farmers in the region. The starch granules were found to be of the bimodal distribution characteristic of domesticated species, indicating they were likely from wild grasses rather than domesticated ones. The evidence suggests that foragers in the region had a long history of consuming wild grains and grains, even before the introduction of agriculture. The researchers argue that this early familiarity with wild grains may have facilitated the adoption of domesticated grains from southwestern Asia when Neolithic farmers arrived in the region around 650 BCE.
The paper discusses how the gene MAGI3, a gene that helps regulate cell growth and division, is often altered in cancer. The authors found that in some cases, MAGI3 is truncated by a mechanism called premature polyadenylation, which produces a truncated form of the gene that can interact with other proteins and interfere with the function of the full-length MAGI3 protein. This truncated form of MAGI3 can promote cell growth and transformation, leading to cancer. They identified a specific mechanism by which this truncated MAGI3 is generated, called premature polyadenylation of an intron in the MAGI3 gene, and showed that it occurs in approximately 7.5% of breast cancers they analyzed. They found that the truncated form of MAGI3 interacts with full-length MAGI3 proteins and interferes with the interaction between full-length MAGI3 and another protein called YAP, leading to increased YAP activity and transformation. This suggests that the truncated form of MAGI3 may act as a dominant-negative protein that can contribute to cancer. The study highlights the importance of studying mechanisms of gene alterations beyond single mutations or copy number losses, and identifying new drivers of cancer.
This paper describes a study on how zebra fish larvae detect and pursue prey. The researchers identified a subset of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) called AF7-projecting RGCs that are specifically activated by small moving objects, like paramecia. They found that these RGCs project to two visual areas in the midbrain, AF7 and the tectum. The AF7-projecting RGCs are required for the larvae to perform prey capture behavior, which involves swimming towards the prey. The researchers showed that the AF7-projecting RGCs are tuned to specific sizes and speeds of stimuli and that their activation is selective for prey objects. They also identified specific neurons within the AF7 that project to the tectum and non-retinorecipient areas. They propose a model where the AF7 neurons modulate and gate the tectal output based on behavioral state, while the tectal neurons translate the prey object's position into a motor command. The results identify AF7 as a key component of the prey detection circuit and point to parallel and interconnected pathways between visual and midbrain areas.
The paper examines the composition of trophallactic fluid, a social fluid exchanged between workers in ant colonies. The researchers analyzed the proteins present in trophallactic fluid from young and mature colonies, as well as from individual workers. They found that the fluid contains proteins that vary significantly between different life stages and conditions, including those involved in metabolism, nutrient storage, immunity, and stress response. The proteins were found to differ between workers that focus on brood care versus foraging, and between those that specialize in different castes. The researchers propose that these variations in trophallactic fluid may help coordinate social behavior and physiology across the colony. The fluid also contains proteins that are transferred from one worker to another through social circulation, and may help explain why social insects have longer lifespans compared to solitary species. The study provides evidence for the role of social circulation in controlling ant colony life history and behavior.
The paper describes a new method called ensemble refinement that can extract more detailed information about protein dynamics from X-ray diffraction data than traditional single structure refinement methods. The method uses MD simulations to sample multiple conformations of a protein based on the observed X-ray diffraction patterns. The resulting ensemble of structures is then refined to reproduce the diffraction data. The method is able to extract more detailed information about the molecular dynamics of the protein, such as the presence of "molten cores" that may indicate intermediate states or functional roles. The authors used the method to analyze 20 protein structures and found evidence of specific conformational changes in active site residues that support enzymatic activity. The results suggest that accounting for protein dynamics can provide a more complete picture of the molecular mechanisms underlying biological processes.
The researchers studied how a mutation in the CDON gene, which codes for a co-receptor for the Hedgehog signaling pathway, interacts with fetal alcohol exposure to cause craniofacial defects in mice. They found that CDON mutations and fetal alcohol exposure together caused defects in the development of the forebrain and midface, such as cyclopia and single nostril. They showed that CDON interacted genetically with regulators of the Notch signaling pathway, which is upstream of the Hedgehog pathway in patterning the rostral midline. The researchers also found that CDON mutations reduced expression of genes that mark the anterior primitive streak, which is the stage when the Hedgehog pathway is initiated. They proposed that CDON and LRP2, another co-receptor, function together to regulate Notch signaling in the anterior primitive streak. When CDON was mutated and mice were exposed to fetal alcohol, the combination resulted in defects that were similar to those seen in mice with hypomorphic mutations in the Notch pathway. They showed that CDON interacted with TDGF1, a key component of the Notch receptor, and that fetal alcohol reduced expression of Notch target genes in the anterior primitive streak. This suggests that fetal alcohol exposure likely acts on the Notch pathway through CDON and LRP2, rather than directly on Hedgehog signaling. The findings provide insight into how environmental factors interact with genetic mutations to cause craniofacial defects and could help explain the complex etiology of human craniofacial defects.
The paper describes a study on the neural circuits that control the rapid regulation of antidiuretic hormone (AVP) release in response to water and food ingestion. The researchers used viral tracing techniques to identify the neurons in the hypothalamus that provide inputs to AVP neurons and map their connections. They found that two parallel circuits, one involving the lateral hypothal nucleus (LH) and another involving the arcuate nucleus (ARC), are involved in water-related presystemic regulation of AVP neurons. The LT neurons provide direct synaptic input to AVP neurons and exhibit rapid responses that closely resemble AVP neuron responses. The ARC neurons, in contrast, mediate food-related presystemic regulation and do not provide inputs to AVP neurons. The study identified three groups of LT neurons that provide inputs to AVP neurons: MnPO/OVglut2, MnPO/OVglut2, and MnPO/OVglut2 neurons. The MnPO/OVglut2 neurons are required for water-related presystemic regulation of AVP neurons while the MnPO/OVglut2 neurons are not involved in food-related presystemic regulation. The findings suggest that water and food-related presystemic signals are relayed to AVP neurons independently through two distinct neural pathways, providing a basis for the bidirectional and asymmetric response of AVP neurons. The study provides new insights into the neural circuits underlying presystemic regulation of AVP release and may help identify key components of the circuitry involved in regulating different aspects of homeostasis.
The paper discusses the study of footprints found in the Grotta della Bàsura cave in Italy that date back to the Upper Paleolithic period around 14,000 years ago. The researchers used a combination of radiometric dating, 3D scanning, photogrammetry, and morphometric analysis of the footprints to determine the number of individuals, age, gender and behavior of the people who made the prints. They found that there were likely 5 individuals, including a child, pre-adolescent, sub-adult, adult and 3 adults. The footprints suggest that the people crawled in some areas of the cave and walked in others. They also found that the children were active participants in exploring the cave even in dangerous tasks. The findings support the idea that Upper Paleolithic groups were heterogeneous in age and gender, and that their activities were driven by curiosity rather than just subsistence needs.
This paper describes a new technique to measure the olfactory preferences of individual Drosophila larvae using a Y-maze assay. They found that when larvae learn to associate a rewarding odor with an electrical stimulus, they either switch from innate avoidance to learned indifference or remain indifferent. They demonstrated that this learning is a discrete and quantized process, with larvae either forming a long-term memory that persists overnight or reverting to their innate avoidance. They showed that training overnight can consolidate the memory, making it more resistant to extinction, and that long-term memories require protein synthesis. The experiments also demonstrated that spaced training rather than massed training can form long-term memories. The results provide a starting point for studying the complete olfactory learning circuit and suggest that long-term memories may require protein synthesis.
The paper proposes that bats recognize places by remembering the echo signature or echo templates instead of reconstructing the 3D layout of the environment. This template-based approach would be driven by the limitations of their sonar system, which cannot accurately reconstruct 3D layout from the echoes due to low signal-to-noise ratio, ambiguity of cues, and low temporal resolution. While bats have been shown to recognize objects in object recognition experiments, they do not build a 3D model of the objects. Instead, they look for diagnostic acoustic cues like spectral features. The proposed template-based approach would use echo templates derived from ensonification data to classify echoes from the environment. The templates would be used to build a cognitive map, but the templates would not be able to distinguish between scenes with similar 3D layouts. Behavioral evidence in favor of this approach would consist of bats failing to distinguish complex scenes with similar echo templates. The paper suggests future experiments could test this prediction by generating echoes from complex virtual scenes and their mirror images, which should result in the same template, while a 3D model predicts bats should be able to distinguish between rotated versions of the same underlying scene.
The paper proposes a new mechanism for how the SecYEG-SecA translocation complex uses the ATP hydrolysis reaction to drive protein translocation across the membrane. The authors used molecular dynamics simulations, single molecule FRET and biochemical assays to investigate the interactions between SecYEG and SecA. They found that the SecY channel is predominantly open when SecA is ATP bound and closed when SecA is ADP bound. The aperture of the channel regulates nucleotide exchange in SecA. The closed channel provides a selective barrier against larger substrates. The authors propose a Brownian ratchet mechanism where a blockage at the SecY channel entrance triggers nucleotide exchange, leading to a brief opening of the channel and allowing the blocked substrate to diffuse. The channel then closes upon ATP hydrolysis. This produces a net forward driving force, ensuring that the entire protein emerges from the channel and prevents backsliding. The proposed mechanism only requires an open state, which could be reserved for the largest substrates. The model accounts for many observed properties of SecYEG-SecA and provides a unifying concept for protein transport in general.
This paper investigated how the nervous system of the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans controls the timing of sexual maturation and the acquisition of male-specific features. The researchers found that a conserved regulatory pathway involving the lin-28/let-7/lin-4 genes and the lin-4/let-7 miRNA controls the timing of neuron maturation and the emergence of male-specific traits. The lin-28/let-7 pathway regulates the expression of lin-4, which in turn controls the timing of lin-29 expression in neurons. The lin-29 expression is temporally controlled by the heterochronic genes and the sex determination pathway. The lin-29 expression in neurons is specifically required for the acquisition of male-specific neuronal morphologies and behaviors, including the AIM neurotransmitter switch, cholinergic gene expression, and mating behavior. The expression of lin-29 in neurons is also controlled by terminal selector genes that define the identity of the neurons. The results suggest that the regulatory mechanisms underlying the emergence of male-specific traits in the nervous system are modular, with different outputs controlled by different effector genes that are controlled by distinct regulatory factors.
The researchers discovered a protein that is used to identify germ cells in mice and is expressed in cells that carry a heritable genome, including stem cells that give rise to germ cells and germ cells themselves. They found that the protein is also expressed in other organisms, such as plants and fungi, and is required for male fertility in mice. They propose that the protein, called GCNA, has a function in maintaining the integrity of the genome across generations and may be part of a specialized program that helps cells cope with DNA damage during meiosis, which involves extensive DNA damage.
The study found that the absence of the estrogen receptor alpha gene in the epithelial cells of the oviductus, which regulates the secretion of immune molecules, leads to impaired fertilization and embryo development. The researchers showed that the lack of epithelial estrogen receptor alpha in the oviduct caused the following problems: 1) sperm migration into the oviduct was impaired, 2) the cumulus cells that surround the ovulated eggs were not able to secrete adequate chemoattractants, 3) proteases and antimicrobial peptides were elevated in the oviduct, 4) the zona pellucida was altered, and 5) the embryos died prematurely. These problems were rescued by adding protease inhibitors to the ovid to prevent protease activity. The researchers propose that estrogen signaling in the ovid epithelial cells during the preovulatory period helps regulate the ovid environment to allow fertilization and embry development. The failure of sperm migration, protease activity and protease-mediated embryo death may be caused by a failure of the zona pellucida to protect the embryo. The study suggests that disruption of estrogen signaling in the ovid epithelial cells could prevent pregnancy by interfering with the ovid mucosal immune response.
The paper describes an analysis of the role of FOXL2 in regulating estrogen signaling in granulosa cells. FOXL2 is a transcription factor that is required for the development of granulosa cells, particularly in the ovarian follicles. The study shows that FOXL2 regulates the expression of estrogen receptors ESR1 and ESR2, and is required for the expression of ESR2 itself. FOXL2 also regulates the expression of genes that are activated by estrogen signaling, including the enzyme Cyp19a1 involved in estrogen production. The study found that FOXL2 is required for the expression of ESR2 and that ESR2 is the main effector of estrogen signaling in granulosa cells. FOXL2 regulates the expression of genes involved in estrogen signaling through both direct and indirect mechanisms, including the regulation of ESR2 expression. The study also found that FOXL2 is required for the maintenance of granulosa cell identity by repressing the gene Sox9. The findings suggest a feedforward loop in which FOXL2 stimulates both estrogen production and receptivity, which maintains granulosa cell identity. The study provides evidence that FOXL2 plays an important role in estrogen signaling and is required for proper granulosa cell function and identity.
This paper describes a new approach to identify which receptors in the vomeronasal system are responsible for detecting pheromones. The researchers used a technique called calcium imaging to identify which neurons in the vomeronasal sensory system respond to different pheromones, specifically estrus and gender-specific signals. They then used a transgenic approach to express the identified receptor genes in the vomeronasal sensory neurons and purify the pheromone ligands. They found that multiple receptors are required to detect the same pheromone signals, which suggests that the system has redundant logic to ensure robust detection of important signals. The study identified two receptors that recognize estrus signals and female gender cues, V1rj2 and V1rj3. These receptors are found on different chromosomes, indicating that the genes for these receptors have expanded in the genome to enable the redundant detection of signals. The system likely integrates these signals through a hierarchical circuit, possibly involving multiple nodes of "AND" gates in the brain. The redundant detection of pheromone signals provides a safeguard against false signals and allows for quantitative information about the pheromone ligands. The results suggest that the vomeronasal system has logic that can detect complex pheromone cues in a redundant manner, which may enhance reproductive success.
The paper describes the structural and thermodynamic analysis of two homeodomain proteins, HOXB13 and CDX2, which can bind to two different DNA sequences with similar affinity. The authors found that the two binding sites are due to different contributions of enthalpy and entropy. The enthalpy contribution is primarily responsible for the binding of one sequence, while the entropy contribution is responsible for the binding of the other. This suggests that many transcription factors can bind to multiple DNA sequences with different affinities, which was previously unknown. The findings provide insight into how transcription factors bind to multiple sequences and how genetic epistasis works. The results also highlight the importance of considering both enthalpy and entropy when modeling transcription factor binding sites, as a single positional weight matrix model may not accurately describe the phenomenon. The authors propose that the ability of one molecular shape to bind to two distinct molecular shapes with similar affinity allows evolution of two types of regulatory sequences, and that this mechanism is likely widespread in biology.
The researchers determined the structure of the flagellum-mediating protein FliD from Pseudomonas aeruginosa using X-ray crystallography. They found that FliD forms a stable hexameric oligomer in solution, which is functional in vivo, allowing Pseudomonas to swim like normal. They showed that the flexible regions outside of the head domains control FliD oligomerization, and that regions inside the head domains are highly dynamic. The study revealed new structural features of FliD, including that each of the six head regions is composed of two discreet lobes, and that a cysteine mutation within the head regions can stabilize the oligomer. The researchers also showed that the oligomeric states of FliD differ between bacteria, with Pseudomonas forming hexamers and Salmonella forming pentamers. The findings provide insight into the mechanisms of flagellum assembly and the role of FliD in flagellar function, and suggest that conformational flexibility in regions outside of the head domains is not a functional requirement for FliD. The study lays the groundwork for developing small molecule inhibitors of FliD oligomerization as novel antibiotics.
The paper describes a new mechanism of antibiotic resistance in bacteria. The authors found that a mutation in the gene WaaL15 can make bacteria more resistant to vancomycin by producing a new form of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that binds to the antibiotic. This modified LPS molecule acts as a "decoy" for vancomycin, sequestering it away from the cell wall where it would normally bind and inhibit peptidoglycan synthesis. The mutation does not affect the cell wall itself, but instead increases the number of free lipid II molecules that can bind vancomycin, titrating it away from its target. This mechanism of resistance is different from other known mechanisms in gram-positive bacteria that alter peptidoglycan synthesis or reduce transpeptidation. The ability of LPS to bind vancomin suggests that lipid II is the donor for this new glycoform. The study shows that the mutation can confer antibiotic resistance in multiple strains of E. coli without affecting the cell wall, demonstrating the adaptability of bacteria to antibiotic stress.
This paper investigates how the protein TRPM3 is regulated by Gi/o-coupled receptors in sensory neurons. TRPM3 is expressed in sensory neurons where it senses temperature and plays a role in pain sensitivity. The researchers found that activation of Gi/o-coupled opioid, GABA, and NPY receptors can inhibit TRPM3 activity in isolated sensory neurons. They found that this inhibition is mediated by Gβ subunits, not Gα subunits. They also showed that intraplantar administration of opioid agonists can modulate nociceptive behaviors in mice, consistent with the idea that Gi/o-coupled receptors can regulate TRPM3 activity in vivo. The results suggest that Gβ subunits can regulate TRPM3 activity directly, without the need for Gα subunits to activate cAMP signaling pathways. This provides a novel mechanism for Gi/o-coupled receptor regulation of ion channels.
The paper discusses how the immune system's ability to respond to vaccines is influenced by preexisting memory T cells. Researchers analyzed the memory CD4 T cell repertoire of healthy adults before and after they received a hepatitis B vaccine. They found that vaccine-specific TCRβ sequences were already present in the memory CD4 T cell repertoire before vaccination, indicating that preexisting memory CD4 T cells could predict which individuals would mount an early and more vigorous immune response to the vaccine. This was seen by a higher fold change in anti-HBs antibody titer and more significant induction of vaccine-specific CD4 T cells. Individuals with earlier anti-HBs titers had more vaccine-specific TCRβ sequences in their memory CD4 repertoire before vaccination, even though they did not have anti-Hs antibodies or vaccine history. This suggests that preexisting memory CD4 T cells may have been primed by exposure to environmental triggers or the human microbiome. The study also identified a subset of 4-1BB+CD45RA− TREG cells that were expanded in individuals with a delayed immune response to the vaccine, which may play a role in suppressing T cell-dependent antibody production. The findings suggest that preexisting memory CD4 T cells can influence vaccine-induced immunity and provide a useful predictor of response to vaccines.
The paper describes how altering the conformations of tubulin, a protein that makes up microtubules, can affect microtubule dynamics. The study found that mutations in tubulin that make it more straight can reduce the frequency of microtubule catastrophes and slow down microtube shrinking. This is because the mutations reduce the ability of tubulin to change conformations in response to nucleotides, which affects the microtuble's lattice structure and allows it to remain straight even when nucleotides are present. The results suggest that conformational changes in tubulin in the microtuble end, rather than the polymerized tubulin itself, are responsible for the observed effects. The study demonstrates that the conformational cycle of tubulin within the microtube influences microtubule dynamics and makes microtubules more amenable to regulation.
The paper describes a new technique called Poly-Ribo-Seq that improves upon traditional ribosome profiling methods to study the translation of small open-frame (smORF) mRNAs. SmORFs are short mRNAs that do not code for proteins but have hallmarks of translation. The authors developed Poly-Ribo-Seq to specifically detect smORFs by separating mRNAs into small and large polysomes based on their ribosome occupancy, and then performing ribosome profiling on the small polysome fraction. Poly-Ribo-Seq detects many more smORFs than traditional ribosome profiling, up to 28 from 107 initially detected in Drosophila S2 cells, and extrapolated to 70% of the total 284 smORFs transcribed in Drosophila. The authors also validate the translated smORFs by performing a tagging assay where they transfected the smORFs with a C-terminal FLAG tag and observed the FLAG signal in S2 cells. The translated smORFs showed different subcellular localizations, transmembrane structures, and bioinformatics indicators similar to annotated protein-coding genes. The results suggest that thousands of smORFs are translated in metazoan genomes and likely encode functional peptides, with two types of translated smORFs: longer ones that are similar to annotated proteins and encode peptides with high transmembrane alpha-helices, and shorter ones that are less conserved and have lower translation efficiencies.
The paper discusses how sensory information from different sensory channels is integrated in the brain. In the case of touch, there are different types of sensory receptors that respond to different aspects of the environment. The paper shows that the responses of sensory neurons in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) integrate information from both rapidly adapting (RA) and Pacinian (PC) afferents. While the RA afferents increase their firing rate with stimulus amplitude, the PC afferents exhibit higher temporal precision in their spiking patterns. The PC inputs are excitatory and inhibitory, while the RA inputs are mainly excitatory. The integration of these different afferent responses in S1 is optimized to encode information about stimuli encountered during interactions with objects. The results suggest that the integration of input from different sensory channels reflects the response properties of the channels themselves and the statistics of the stimuli encountered during everyday interactions. This integration allows the brain to transmit information in an efficient and informative way.
The paper describes an experiment that aimed to determine the mechanisms by which neuronal activity in the cerebral cortex controls blood flow. The authors used optogenetics to selectively stimulate neurons expressing the gene ChR2, which encodes the channel protein ChR2, to test whether the vasoactive effect was mediated by excitatory or inhibitory neurons. They found that the initial dilation occurred in deep cortical layers, not in layer IV where energy metabolism is highest, and that the constriction was specifically mediated by activation of neurons expressing the neurotransmitter NPY. The constriction was blocked by blocking NPY receptors. These results suggest that the vasoactive agents released by neurons, rather than energy metabolism, drive the vascular response. The authors conclude that the biphasic dilation/constriction response is a feedforward mechanism mediated by specific vasoactive agents released by neurons, rather than energy metabolism.
The authors used a combination of X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and in vitro kinase assays to investigate the allosteric regulation of the receptor tyrosine kinase FGFR2K. They found that the A-loop tyrosine phosphorylation activates the kinase by weakening hydrogen bonds between the A-loop and the molecular brake, which disengages the molecular brake. The molecular brake consists of a hydrogen bond network that autoinhibits the kinase. They identified two regulatory sites, the DFG latch and αC tether, which modulate the conformation of the A-loop. The DFG latch consists of hydrophobic interactions between the A-loop and the αC helix, while the αC tether is a hydrophobic tether between the A-loop and the molecular brake. They showed that mutations that weaken the DFG latch or αC tether activate the kinase by fortifying these hydrogen bonds. NMR spectroscopy and CPMG relaxation experiments supported their allosteric model, showing that the A-loop tyrosine phosphorylation increases conformational dynamics of the kinase, especially in the DFG motif. They proposed that ATP binding to the kinase also activates the kinase by promoting conformational changes between the inhibited and active states, but does not directly impact the hydrogen bonds between the A-loop and molecular brake.
The paper describes a new method called SynEM that can automatically detect synapses in large connectomes of neurons from electron microscopy data. This is important because manual annotation of synapses is very time-consuming and difficult, and limits the scale of connectomics studies. SynEM uses the following steps: 1) It first classifies interfaces between neuron processes based on features from 3D EM images. 2) It assigns synapses to neurons based on the interface and synapse direction. 3) It outputs a synapse score for each interface. 4) It then thresholdes the scores to classify interfaces as synaptic or non-synaptic. The method achieves high precision and recall of 87% and 86% on a test set of 235 synapses. It is also able to automatically detect synapses in in a dense connectome of 80 synapses, which is sufficient for most connectomics studies. The authors demonstrate that SynEM outperforms other methods and can detect synapses in high-resolution EM data, which is scalable to large volumes.
The paper discusses how the balance between the drive to sleep and the drive to engage in sexual behavior in male fruit flies is regulated by a network of neurons. The authors found that a specific group of neurons in the dorsal ganglion called MS1 neurons inhibit sleep in the presence of a female fly. They identified a subset of neurons called FRU neurons that receive input from MS1 neurons. MS1 neurons send excitatory input to several FRU clusters that modulate sleep and sexual behaviors in male flies. The MS1 neurons receive input from FRU neurons, but do not express FRU. The authors propose that the MS1 neurons act upstream of FRU neurons and provide excitatory input to balance sleep and sexual behaviors in male flies. The findings provide insight into how the neural circuits underlying the choice between sleep and sexual behaviors are regulated and could help us understand how the balance between motivational factors and sleep regulation are integrated in other organisms.
The paper investigates how the extracellular and intracellular regions of Delta-like ligands (DLL1 and DLL4) contribute to their different functions in vivo. The authors find that differences between the two ligands are encoded in the extracellular domains, particularly the MNNL-EGF3 region. The extracellular domain of DLL4 has a higher affinity for Notch receptors and activates Notch signaling more efficiently, while the intracellular domain of DLL1 has a lower affinity and activates Notch signaling less efficiently. They test this by generating chimeric ligands that exchange the extracellular or intracellular domains between DLL1 and DLL4 and comparing their activity in cell-based assays and mice. They find that the extracellular domain of DLL1 or DLL4 determines the differences in activating Notch receptors, with residues outside the known binding interface also contributing. The contact aminoacs in the MNNL and DSL domains do not seem to be the dominant factors. In mice, the exchange of the extracellular domain of DLL1 into DLL4 (D1N-E3_D4) does not fully substitute for DLL1 during somite patterning, indicating that other factors outside the known interface contribute to the differences between the two ligands. These results suggest that the domain cores and/interactions outside the binding interface, rather than just the binding affinity, are responsible for the functional divergence of DLL1 and DLL4.
This paper discusses how endothelial cells in the brain regulate blood flow. The researchers found that brain endothelial cells express a type of ion channel called TRPV4 that allows sodium and calcium to enter the cell when the cell is depolarized. When the cell is hyperpolarized, the TRPV4 channels become closed and allow sodium to enter. This creates a hyperpolarizing signal that can dilate blood vessels and increase blood flow. However, when brain endothelial cells are activated by a G protein-coupled receptor, the receptor's signaling pathway depletes phosphatidylinositol 4-4-phosphate (PIP2), which inhibits the TRPV4 channels. This allows the TRPV4 channels to open and creates an electrical signal that can hyperpolarize the cell, which inhibits the hyperpolarizing signal. The researchers showed that this balance between TRPV4 and Kir2.1 channels is shifted by GqPCR signaling that depletes PI4P2. When PI4P2 is low, the TRPV4 channels open and the hyperpolarizing signal is inhibited, while when PI4P2 is high, the TRPV4 channels close and the hyperpolarizing signal is allowed to proceed. The researchers suggest that this GqPCR-PI4P2 axis may play a key role in regulating blood flow in the brain.
The paper proposes that handshaking may serve as a subliminal mechanism for humans to sample social chemosignals, which are chemical signals that influence human behavior. The authors tested this by analyzing data from 153 subjects who participated in a handshaking experiment where they were asked to shake hands with 20 different experimenters. They found that after shaking hands with the same gender, humans increased the duration of touching their own hands, especially the right hand, which is typically associated with olfactory exploration. This increase in exploration was only observed after shaking hands with the same gender. However, when shaking hands with the opposite gender, humans decreased the duration of touching their left hand, which is typically associated with self-sampling. The authors suggest that this difference in behavior may indicate that handshaking serves as a way for humans to subconsciously sample social chemosignals. The study also found that odors can influence this behavior, with odors that were not consciously perceived by subjects also affecting the exploration of the right hand. The results suggest that humans may have evolved a mechanism to subconsciously sample social chemosignals through handshaking, which could help explain why humans exhibit social chemosignaling behaviors without being aware of the underlying chemical signals.
The paper proposes a software tool called Spot-On to analyze single-molecule tracking data to accurately estimate subpopulations of molecules in a sample and their diffusion constants. Spot-On corrects for four biases present in single-molecule tracking data: motion blurring, tracking errors, defocalization bias, and modeling biases. The authors demonstrate that Spot-On can accurately estimate diffusion constants and subpopulation fractions from simulated data and experimental data using a photoactivatable stroboscopic single-molecule tracking (spaST) technique. They evaluate the performance of Spot-On on 106 spaST experiments across 60 different conditions and compare it to other methods. They show that Spot-On is robust and can handle anomalous diffusion. The authors propose using spaST to study cell-to-cell variability in transcription factor dynamics and other proteins with varying diffusion dynamics. They make the Spot-On tool available as a web interface and provide details on how to implement it in Matlab and Python.
This paper describes a new technique called "decoy" that allows researchers to identify which genes in plants control the circadian clock. The researchers created a library of genes that express a protein that is missing the part of the protein that interacts with the enzyme that breaks down other proteins, called E3 ligases. They then transformed plants with these decoy proteins and found that some plants had changes in their circadian rhythms, indicating that the decoys were affecting the clock function. They identified several genes that had effects on the clock's period or phase. These genes are likely to be redundant, meaning they have the same function as other genes in the clock. The technique of using decoys is useful for identifying genes that control the clock because traditional methods of studying clock function have difficulty finding redundant genes. The study identified several new genes that control the plant circadian clock, including some that interact with known clock proteins and spliceosome components. The decoy technique is applicable to other families of E3 ligases, and the genes identified here could serve as a starting point for future studies on the clock.
The paper describes a new technique called Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC) that allows researchers to analyze hundreds of different proteins and cell surface markers in a single tissue sample. They used this technique on a postmortem brain tissue sample from a patient with severe rebound multiple sclerosis after natalizumab therapy withdrawal. The IMC analysis found that microglia and macrophages within the brain tissue had lost their normal homeostatic phenotype and acquired an activated state, which is consistent with previous studies. T cells and B cells were also found in the lesions and tissue, with some cells showing changes consistent with previous immunohistochemistry studies. The IMC approach has the advantage of simultaneously analyzing multiple cell types and functional states, but has limitations such as low throughput and only analyzing a single brain region. The authors propose that the technique will enable a high-dimensional analysis of single-cell phenotypes and interactions in relation to lesion morphometry and demyelination activity in MS.
The paper discusses how neutrophils, a type of white blood cell, are a key component of inflammation and chronic diseases like COPD and asthma. Currently, there are no treatments that specifically target the inflammation caused by neutrophils. The researchers found that inhibiting a family of proteins called ErbB receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) can help reduce neutrophil inflammation by promoting neutrophil apoptosis. They identified several ErbB inhibitors as potential treatments through a screening approach and tested them in cell culture, zebrafish and mice models. Inhibiting ErbBs reduced neutrophil number and inflammation in the mice, even when inflammatory stimuli like LPS were present. The researchers conclude that ErbB inhibitors could be a new strategy to treat chronic inflammatory diseases like COPD and possibly repurpose existing ErbB inhibitors from cancer treatments.
The paper describes how the bacterium Bacillus subtilis uses engulfment to form spores, which involves the mother cell engulfing a smaller forespore cell within itself. The authors used cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) to study the process at a resolution of a few nanometers. They found that the mother cell membrane does not completely dissolve the septum at the start of engulfment, but instead forms finger-like projections to move around the forespore. The paper proposes a model where new peptidoglycan is synthesized ahead of the leading edge of the engulfing membrane and is degraded by DMP complexes, making room for the engulfing membrane to advance. This allows the mother cell to move around the forespore and eventually engulf it. The study reveals new details about the architecture of the process and structures inside and around the developing spore, including a thin layer of peptidoglycan between the mother cell and forespore membranes. The study also shows that DMP complexes are required to form finger-like projections at the leading edge of the engulfing membrane, which helps the mother cell move around the forespore. The findings provide insights into how engulfment evolved to spatially and temporally regulate the conserved protein machineries that synthesize and degrade peptidoglycan.
The paper discusses how to analyze and interpret adverse event reports from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database. The authors map drugs to their active chemical ingredients in order to better identify drug-adverse event associations. They find that this mapping helps distinguish between true associations and biases in the data. For example, they show that the drug rofecoxib has a strong association with gastric ulcer and gastrointestinal hemorrhage, but the synonym "Prozac" does not. When reports are sorted by indication and ADR, errors in reporting are reduced. They analyze the time evolution of adverse event reports for individual drugs and find that the number of reports changes over time reflects new populations exposed to the drug. However, stimulated reporting from events like the withdrawal of another drug and regulatory changes can also affect the data. The paper concludes that analyzing adverse event reports in a time-resolved manner can help identify biases and reveal underlying mechanisms. They propose using this approach to better utilize the FAERS database and make it more useful for identifying drug-adverse event associations.
The paper describes the results of an experiment that aimed to understand how the brain changes in response to repeated exposure to cocaine, a drug of abuse. The researchers found that repeated exposure to cocaine leads to changes in gene expression in different brain structures, with different patterns of gene expression depending on the type of neuron and the history of exposure. They found that the striatum, a brain region called the dorsal striatum, is a key site of change, with different gene expression patterns depending on whether the neurons are direct or indirect pathway. They identified a gene called Egr2 as being particularly involved in cocaine sensitization and found that expression of Egr2 in the ventral striatum, but not the medial striatum, is important for developing cocaine seeking behavior. They also found that inhibiting expression of Egr2 in the ventral striatum reduces cocaine conditioned place preference, suggesting that Egr2 expression in this region is involved in cocaine seeking. The results provide a comprehensive picture of how the brain changes in response to cocaine exposure and how these changes may contribute to addiction.
The paper explores how different types of ion channels in O-LM cells may contribute to their different spiking properties, such as being able to fire at low or high theta frequencies. The authors created models of O-LM cells with either somatic or somatodendritic ion channels and examined how different ion channel distributions and ion channel conductances affected their spiking responses to modulated inputs. They found that somatodendritic O-LM cells were able to fire at higher theta frequencies of 4-9 Hz, while somatic O-LM cells fired at lower frequencies of 2-5 Hz. Blocking ion channels affected the spiking properties of the O-LM models, showing that ion channels like Kdrs and KA were important for the high theta spiking of somatodendritic O-LM cells. The authors simulated the effect of cAMP modulation of ion channels to enhance ion channel activation and found that this increased the high theta firing of somatodendritic O-LM cells. They predict that dendritic expression of ion channels in O-LM cells, which has not been well studied, may play a role in determining the spiking preferences of different O-LM cell types. The results suggest that the different spiking properties of O-LM cells may be related to the different types of theta rhythms observed in rodents, with somatodendritic O-LM cells firing at higher theta frequencies.
The paper describes research on a protein called Ocr that is produced by a bacteriophage and inhibits the host E. coli's transcriptional machinery. Ocr is a DNA mimicry protein that binds to the host RNA polymerase and inhibits its function. The researchers used biochemical and structural studies to determine how Ocr interacts with RNA polymerase. They found that Ocr binds to RNA polymerase as a dimer and occupies the space where the transcriptional bubble and downstream DNA reside in the open complex. This inhibits the host transcriptional machinery. The structural studies showed that Ocr remains a dimer and binds at the downstream DNA channel of RNA polymerase via complementary interactions. However, the binding is not specific and occurs through non-specific interactions with the positively charged RNA polymerase. The research suggests that Ocr could potentially interact and inhibit other DNA processing enzymes through similar non-specific interactions with DNA binding sites/channels. The study demonstrates that Ocr could be modified to fine-tune its DNA mimicry to bind specifically to other DNA processing proteins and exploited to inhibit transcription under stress conditions when transcriptional activity is reduced. The results provide new insights into the mechanisms of how Ocr inhibits the host transcriptional machery and could potentially be exploited to create variants that target specific DNA processing proteins.
This paper describes how the authors developed a new method to monitor and manipulate the sleep patterns of Drosophila larvae, a stage of development in fruit flies. They found that larval Drosophila exhibit brief periods of reversible behavioral quiescence characterized by a change in posture and increased arousal threshold, which meet the criteria for sleep. They showed that larval sleep deprivation reduces the rate of neural stem cell proliferation, suggesting that sleep may play a role in initiating the wave of neurogenesis during early development. The authors also found that the most severe short-sleeping mutations identified in adult flies exhibit no sleep phenotype in larvae, and that sleep time in larvae is not correlated with that of adults. They propose that the different sleep regulatory mechanisms in larvae and adults may be due to the different environmental cues and developmental demands in each stage. The larval system provides a new opportunity to study how sleep and neurogenesis are mechanistically coupled, and how sleep loss in early life affects brain development. The findings suggest that sleep may play a permissive role in initiating neurogenesis but not be essential to sustain it, and that accelerating or slowing cell division could have predictable effects. The study provides insights into the genetic and molecular control of sleep during development.
This paper discusses how bacteria can communicate with yeast cells through a simple molecule called lactic acid to induce a heritable change in metabolism in the yeast, called the [GAR+] prion. The yeast cells can switch from being specialized in glucose metabolism to being able to metabolize a variety of carbon sources in response to lactic acid. The researchers found that lactic acid is sufficient to induce the [GAR+] prion in yeast, and that the ability to do so is conserved across evolutionary distance, even in a distant species like Dekkera bruxellensis. The researchers propose that lactic acid may be a signal that allows bacteria and yeast to communicate and modulate their metabolism in a way that benefits both species, potentially leading to increased fitness in complex microbial communities. The study highlights the potential of cross-kingdom communication and the possibility that common metabolites like lactic acid could be used to rapidly switch between metabolic strategies in response to environmental cues.
The study found that in yeast, some genes are arranged in pairs or clusters where the genes in the same orientation have overlapping transcripts, or antisense transcripts that overlap each other. This overlapping transcription can create a "state-switching" mechanism where the genes switch between a sense and antisense orientation depending on environmental conditions. The study showed that the sense orientation of one gene can repress the antisense orientation of the adjacent gene, and that the antisense transcript can limit the number of cells that contain the sense transcript. This reciprocal regulation allows the genes to switch between a sense and antisense state in response to changes in the environment. The study also found that a technique called "transcriptional interference" is common in yeast, where genes with overlapping transcripts can switch between the sense and antisense orientation to regulate each other. The authors propose that the strength of the proximal promoter and terminator determines whether a region is capable of making a state-switch, and that transcriptional interference is a key mechanism that couples the regulatory elements in the genome.
The paper investigates how locomotion affects the activity of neurons in the primary visual cortex V1. The authors use two-photon calcium imaging to monitor the activity of excitatory neurons and three subtypes of inhibitory neurons (vasoactive intestinal peptide, somatostatin, and parvalbumin) in awake mice running on a treadmill. They find that during visual stimulation, all three subtypes of inhibitory neurons show increased activity during locomotion, challenging a previously proposed disinhibitory model that disinhibitory neurons are activated by locomotion. They conclude that the increased activity of in inhibitory neurons during locomotion is likely due to neuromodulatory inputs rather than disinhibition through VIP neurons. They propose that neuromodulatory inputs from cholinergic and noradrenergic neurons directly activate excitatory neurons, while subcortical inputs from the thalamus and dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus also contribute to the modulation of visual responses during locomotion. The diversity of context-dependent responses to locomotion within in inhibitory neurons suggests that there are functional subtypes within each population. The results suggest that the activity of inhibitory neurons depends strongly on the behavioral context, and that functional properties of inhibitory neurons should not be generalized from one context to another.
The paper discusses how people can accurately align a pointer with a target object based on tactile information from a raised edge. The authors found that participants were able to align the pointer with the target within 3 degrees of accuracy for edges that spanned the entire fingertip, which is significantly better than the 10-20 degree accuracy predicted by previous studies of tactile perception. They also found that participants gathered and processed the tactile information quickly, initiating appropriate movements within 200 milliseconds of initially touching the edge. The authors propose that this is due to the peripheral tactile system's use of heterogeneous receptive fields in first-order tactile neurons, which enable the system to extract spatial details from the edge information more accurately. They propose that this allows the system to resolve spatial features faster than predicted by the Shannon-Nyquist sampling theorem. The authors used a model to simulate the tactile system's ability to process edge orientation information and found that the model that used heterogeneous receptive fields was able to accurately predict the participants' performance.
This paper investigated the energy landscape of a protein called apo-superoxidase domain 1 (apoSOD12SH) which is associated with ALS disease. The protein has a rugged free energy landscape where mature conformations resembling the metal-bound form of the protein coexist with non-native oligomers. The authors used NMR techniques sensitive to detect excited protein conformations to study the protein. They found that apoSOD2SH transiently forms native-like dimers, non-native dimers, and non-native oligomers. They used structural models generated from NMR data to identify the structures of the excited states. The results suggest that metal binding is not required for the formation of the non-native dimers and that the negative end of the helix in the electrostatic loop is important for metal binding. The non-native dimers can serve as a hub for the formation of larger oligomers. The study provides insight into the early stages of SOD1 aggregation and may help design therapeutic agents to prevent cytotoxic species that lead to disease.
This paper describes the structure of the human KATP channel, a type of ion channel that regulates the activity of pancreatic beta cells and plays a role in diabetes. The authors used cryo-electron microscopy to determine the structure of the channel and its complex with the SUR1 subunit, which regulates the channel. They found that the channel adopts two different conformations, a quatrefoil and a propeller form. The quatrefoil form has the transporter module of SUR1 in the same plane as the channel, while in the propeller form the SUR1 is offset from the channel. They also observed that the ATP-binding site on Kir6.2 is buttressed by the lasso extension, which may interfere with ATP inhibition of the channel. They found that SUR1 regulates ATP inhibition through both ATP and ADP binding. The structure of the lasso extension and the interaction between SUR1 and the Kir6.2 CTD may provide a mechanism for SUR1 to sense changes in ATP levels and regulate the channel. The authors hope that their findings will provide insights into how KATP channels sense metabolic state.
The paper describes a study comparing the developmental biology of the parasite species Toxoplasma gondii and Hammia hammidii. Toxoplasma gondii is a commonly infectious parasite that infects humans and other animals, while Hammia hammidii is less commonly found in the environment and only infects felids. The researchers found that T. gondii can form tissue cysts in vitro and is more flexible in its development, while H. hammid terminally differentiates into a cyst stage that is no longer infectious to anything but felids. They found that H. hammid is less able to form tissue cysts in vitro and lacks the ability to induce cyst formation in response to high pH stress, suggesting that H. hammid has a different developmental program. This may underlie the difference in virulence between the two species. The researchers also found that H. hammid has a unique transcriptome that is distinct from T. gondii, with genes expressed earlier in development being enriched in T. gondii. They were able to genetically manipulate H. hammid and create a transgenic line that expresses a red fluorescent protein. This allowed them to study H. hammid development in vitro and infectivity in vivo, and identify potential factors that may contribute to the difference in virulence between the two species. They identified a short window of infectivity when H. hammid could be used to infect new hosts, which they exploited to create a transgenic H. hammid line. The study highlights the distinct developmental and transcriptomic differences between the two species, which may contribute to their different virulence.
This paper describes research on the histone protein H3K23me3 and its role in heterochromatin formation in the organism Tetrahymena. H3K23me3 is found in the germline micronucleus of Tetrahymena but not in somatic macronuclei. The authors show that H3K23me3 levels increase during meiosis and are required for proper meiosis, as a lack of H3K23me3 leads to increased DNA damage and reduced progeny viability. They propose a model in which H3K23me3 helps organize a specialized heterochromatin structure that protects pericentric heterochromatin regions from DNA damage. The loss of H3K23me3 leads to increased DNA damage at non-coding regions, which is consistent with the upregulation of H3K23me3 during meiosis. They also show that H3K23me3 is conserved in C. elegans and increases during meiosis. The paper highlights the importance of understanding the relationship between histone PTMs and genome instability, as well as the role of H3K23me3 in heterochromatin and meiosis.
The paper discusses how adding aquatic animals to rice fields can increase rice production while reducing fertilizer use. They conducted three field experiments and three mesocosm experiments to study how this works. They found that adding carp, crabs, and turtles to rice fields increased rice yield and nitrogen use efficiency, while reducing weed growth. The aquatic animals reduced competing weeds, which allowed rice plants to grow better. They also found that the aquatic animals increased organic matter decomposition in the soil, which released nutrients that were then used by rice plants. Unconsumed feed-N from the aquatic animals was also used by rice plants, further increasing their nitrogen efficiency. The results suggest that adding aquatic animals to rice fields can increase yield and reduce fertilizer use, providing a more sustainable way to produce rice. However, they acknowledge that potential negative effects from feed and increased decomposition rates should be considered.
The paper discusses how a specific enzyme called ceramide synthase 2b (Cers2b) helps regulate sphingolipid metabolism during embryonic development in zebrafish. The enzyme is expressed in embryos as a maternal transcript and is upregulated when the enzyme that generates sphingolipid sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is missing. This allows the embryos to tolerate high levels of sphingolipid without developing defects. The upregulation of Cers2b leads to an alternative metabolic pathway that removes excess sphingolipids and prevents toxicity. The study shows that Cers2b functions in part through a homeobox domain that can repress its own gene, and is also able to repress the activity of the sphingolipid promoter. This mechanism is important for embryonic development and allows the embryos to regulate sphingolipid metabolism when S1P is missing.
This paper proposes a method to learn approximate likelihood functions for stochastic simulation models that can be used for Bayesian inference. The idea is to use neural networks to learn functions that approximate the likelihood of the model's parameters given the simulated data. The networks are trained once and then used to estimate parameters for new datasets without retraining. This reduces the computational cost of inference compared to traditional ABC methods that require simulating many trials to obtain likelihoods. The paper focuses on neural networks that learn the likelihood function as a mapping from model parameters to the observed data. Two neural network architectures are proposed: a multi-dimensional neural network that maps model parameters to likelihoods for each trial and a convolutional neural network that maps parameters to a histogram of likelihoods for the entire data space. The methods are shown to be effective for a variety of stochastic simulation models and can be extended to hierarchical inference scenarios. The paper discusses potential limitations and future work to further improve the methods.
The authors used a technique called optogenetics to systematically investigate the individual contributions of the proteins involved in pulling forces that position the spindle of a cell during cell division in the nematode worm C. elegans. They created genetically modified the worms to express genes that could be turned on or off with blue light, allowing them to control the expression of specific proteins in the cells. By using this technique, they found that a protein called lin-5, but not the G alpha subunits gpr-1 and galpha-2, is required for pulling forces that position the spindle. The G alpha subunits act as a membrane anchor, while lin-5 acts as an adaptor protein that activates the dynein protein at the cell cortex. This suggests that the G alpha-GDP-GPR-1 complex acts as a membrane anchor and the G alpha-GTP cycle does not directly contribute to pulling forces.
The paper shows that homologous recombination can occur between different mitochondrial genomes in Drosophila, even in animal species. They used various methods to select for and isolate recombinant mitochondrial genomes that contain sequences from both parental genomes. They found that introduction of double-strand breaks (DSBs) by restriction enzymes in one genome can stimulate homologous recombination, and that a single DSB can be sufficient to promote exchange a long stretch of DNA. They also showed that heteroplasmy between genomes can lead to homology-dependent repair of breaks, even in regions with low homology. The results suggest that homologous recombination occurs frequently between mitochondrial genomes in Drosophila, and this can be used to manipulate mitochondrial genomes for functional mapping and study genetic behavior of mitochondrial diseases. The findings indicate that even rare recombination events can have a significant impact on evolution and disease mutations.
The paper describes a new approach called Chimeric Antigen Receptors for Phagocytosis (CAR-Ps) that can be used to direct immune cells to target and engulf cancer cells. The authors engineered receptors that recognize specific cancer antigens on the surface of cancer cells and activate phagocytosis, the process of ingesting cells by phagocytic cells, in macrophages. They found that macrophages expressing the CAR-Ps were able to internalize cancer cells, leading to cancer cell death. The CAR-Ps were able to target different cancer antigens, including CD19 and CD2, and activate different intracellular signaling domains like Megf10, FcRgamma and CD3zeta. The CAR-Ps were able to trigger phagocytosis of both whole cancer cells and smaller beads, indicating they are effective at engulfing both large and small targets. The authors suggest that combining CAR-Ps with CD47 inhibition or CD47-SIRPA signaling pathway inhibition may enhance phagocytosis and improve cancer cell elimination. They also showed that the CAR-Ps can be used to enhance cross-presentation of cancer antigens, which could be an a promising avenue for cancer immunotherapy. Overall, the study demonstrates that the CAR-P approach is transferable to different immune cells and can promote specific engulfment and elimination of cancer cells, opening up new avenues for cancer therapy.
The researchers used a combination of RNA sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation to study how the TGF signaling molecule NODAL/Activin regulates gene expression in embryonic cells. They found that NODAL/Activin signaling induces two distinct modes of SMAD2 binding to chromatin: one that binds to acetylated chromatin and another that binds to closed chromatin. For genes that are transcriptionally inactive, SMAD2 binds to closed chromatin and induces nucleosome displacement and histone acetylation. This leads to initiation of transcription through recruitment of Pol II. For genes that have a baseline transcription, SMAD2 binds to existing nucleosome-depleted sites and induces further histone acetylation. The results suggest that SMAD2 binding does not directly correlate with gene expression levels, but rather recruits coactivators that modulate the transcriptional output over time. The researchers identified a dynamic transcriptional program that requires a continuous NODAL/Activin signaling input. The long-term binding of SMAD2 to enhancers and the presence of multiple SMAD2 peaks at target genes suggest that SMAD2 recruits multiple coactivators to modulate the transcriptional response.
The paper describes how the interaction between the telomerase enzyme hTERT and the protein TPP1 helps telomerase recruitment to telomeres. The TEN-domain of hTERT contains residues that interact with the TEL-patch of TPP1. Mutations in the TEN-domain of hTERT, but not in the enzymatic activity, disrupt telomere recruitment to telomeres in vivo. The TEN-domain mutants fail to localize to telomeres and maintain telomere length. The authors find that a charge swap of residues in the TEL-patch of TPP1 to the TEN-domain of hTERT can restore the ability of hTERT to localize to telomeres, indicating that the TEN-domain interacts directly with the TEL-patch. This interaction is key to identifying potential therapeutic agents that target telomerase activity in cancer cells, as disruption of the interaction would attenuate telomere shortening associated with some diseases.
The paper describes a study that used whole genome sequencing to analyze the transmission patterns of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in a high prevalence area in Malawi over 15 years. They found that different lineages of the bacteria have different transmission patterns, with lineage 1 having the lowest transmission rate and virulence. Lineages 2 and 3 had the highest transmission rates and virulence, while lineage 1 had the lowest. The study suggests that the low transmission rate and virulence of lineage 1 may be due to its association with HIV infection, which reduces the likelihood of causing active disease in immunosuppressed individuals. The study also found that the proportion of cases due to recent infection and transmission decreased over time, suggesting success of tuberculosis and HIV control programs. The study provides strong evidence for differences in transmission patterns and virulence between lineages, which are unrelated to factors like drug resistance, HIV infection and host subpopulations. The findings could help inform strategies to reduce transmission and improve tuberculosis control.
The paper describes the structural details of the ClpB protein from Escherichia coli, which is involved in protein disaggregation and recovery of proteins from protein aggregates. The authors used cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine the structure of the ClpB protein in complex with the substrate BAP (a variant of ClpA that binds ClpP) and the protein casein. The results showed that the ClpB protein has a coiled-coil propeller structure with a central channel that is surrounded by an AAA+ ring. The AAA+ rings are connected by inter-subunit interactions, with the ND ring being less defined and not accounted for. The authors found that the coiled-coil propeller structure is more tilted in the hyperactive mutant, which has reduced DnaK binding and ATPase activity. The study showed that the MD (motif 1) of the ClpB protein is important for regulating its activity by interacting with the adjacent AAA+ ring. The MD can switch between horizontal and tilted positions, allowing it to interact with either the AAA+ ring or DnaK. The tilted MD in the hyperactive mutant prevents it from binding DnaK, while the horizontal MD in the wild-type allows it to bind DnaK. The study provides the first visualization of the dynamic conformations of the ClpB MD using cryo-EM, which is consistent with biochemical studies. The results explain the mechanism of ClpB activity and provide insights into how it interacts with DnaK to disaggregate proteins.
This paper reports the biochemical characterization of the bacterial protein MgtA, which is a P3-type ATPase that imports magnesium ions into the cytoplasm. The authors found that MgtA is activated by anionic phospholipids, specifically cardiolipin, and is sensitive to magnesium ion concentrations in vitro. They showed that MgtA colocalizes with cardiolipin in vivo and is activated by cardiolipin in vitro. The activation of MgtA is dependent on the headgroup of cardiolipin, rather than the tail. They also found that MgtA is sensitive to magnesium ion concentrations, with the activity decreasing above 1 1 mM magnesium ion free in solution. This suggests that MgtA imports magnesium ions into the cytoplasm, which in turn regulates its own activity. The authors propose a model where low magnesium concentrations activate MgtA by activating the transcription of the mgtA gene, while high magnesium concentrations inhibit MgtA. This model is supported by the localization of MgtA to cardiolipin rich domains in the cytoplasmic membrane and the regulation of mgtA transcription by cytoplasmic magnesium concentrations. The study provides insights into the mechanism of magnesium transport by MgtA and its role in regulating magnesium levels in the cell.
The paper aims to define the areas suitable for zoonotic transmission of Ebola virus, or the routes defined in Figure 1 excluding human-to-human transmission. The researchers used species distribution modeling techniques to map the zoonotic transmission niche of Ebola virus across Africa. They analyzed all reported Ebola virus outbreaks in humans and animals and incorporated new data on suspected Ebola virus reservoirs, bats. The researchers found that the zoonotic transmission niche is more widespread than previously predicted, covering West and Central Africa. They estimated that 230 million people are at risk of zoonotic transmission of Ebola virus in countries where index cases have been reported, and 15 million more in countries where there are suspected reservoir species but no reported cases. They predict that human population growth, urbanization and increased connectivity may have facilitated the spread of Ebola virus outbreaks. They emphasize that this zoonotic niche map does not predict the likelihood of transmission or the likelihood of an outbreak establishing, but rather identifies areas where populations are at risk of zoonotic transmission. They recommend testing suspected Ebola virus reservoir bats in countries where there are no known index cases to clarify the risk. They also suggest that improving surveillance and control measures in at-risk countries would be prudent.
The paper shows that when a gene called LSD1 is deleted from mouse oocytes, it causes defects in the resulting embryos that do not appear until weeks later in development. The defects include failure to undergo the maternal to zygotic transition, perinatal lethality, and abnormal behavior in surviving animals. The researchers propose that this is due to a long-range effect of the deleted LSD1 on the early embryo, which affects the epigenetic landscape in a way that is only revealed later in development. They suggest that the maternal LSD1 plays a key role in enabling the maternal to zygotic transition and that defects in this process could cause the observed phenotypes. This establishes a new mammalian paradigm for how epigenetic changes in the early embryo can lead to defects that manifest weeks later.
The paper describes how protein methylation of RB15 by protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMT1) regulates RB58 and controls the stability of RB58. The PRMT1 V2 isoform primarily dimethylates RB58. This dimethylation triggers RB58 ubiquitination by the E3 ligase CNOT4, which leads to RB58 degradation. RB58 methylation is required for the inclusion of exons 9 and 10 in pre-mRNA splicing, which is important for megakaryocyte differentiation. The PRMT1-RB58 axis regulates the balance between proliferation and differentiation in megakaryocytopoies. The paper provides new insights into the regulation of protein methyltransferases and demethylases and their crosstalk.
The paper discusses how a single transcription factor called Bcd can control the expression of a gene called Hunchback in Drosophila embryos. They used mathematical modeling and experiments to show that the shape of the gene's expression pattern, known as the gene regulatory function, cannot be explained by assuming that Bcd binds to 6 sites in the enhancer in a simple cooperative way. Instead, other factors like binding sites for other transcription factors, changes in chromatin structure, and cofactors that interact with Bcd also play a role in determining the shape of the expression pattern. The experiments showed that the expression pattern cannot be fully explained by assuming that each binding site for Bcd binds in a simple cooperative way. The authors propose that higher-order cooperativity, where binding of multiple sites influences other binding sites, and energy expenditure beyond thermodynamic equilibrium, are necessary to achieve the sharp response of Bcd to Bcd. They argue that cofactors, which interact with Bcd indirectly, may play a key role in shaping the gene expression pattern. The study suggests that the shape of the expression pattern reflects the underlying molecular mechanisms of transcription, rather than just the number of binding sites for Bcd.
This paper discusses the role of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) in controlling viral infections. The authors found that pDCs are activated by infected cells in a cell-cell contact-dependent manner, leading to the production of interferon-alpha (IFN-I) which then induces interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in nearby cells. The IFN-I response is sufficient to control viral infections, even though the level of IFN-I in the blood is undetectable. The pDC-induced ISG response is accelerated by IRF7, which is restricted to pDCs, and this response is sufficient to control two different viruses, dengue fever (DENV) and chikungunya (CHIKV). The pDC-IRF7 response also accelerates interferon-gamma (IFN-II) production by natural killer cells, which contributes to controlling viral replication. The pDC-IRF7-induced ISG response is sufficient to protect mice from infection, even though the level of systemic IFN-I is undetectable. The pDC response to DENV and CHIKV activates NK cells, which produce IFN-II, further contributing to controlling viremia. The pDC response to CHIKV is more effective than the response to DENV, likely due to the greater impact of IFN-I on CHIKV infection. The results suggest that pDCs are a key cell type in initiating antiviral responses, and that their response is triggered by cell-cell contact rather than cytokine production.
This paper describes a new method for imaging calcium activity in macaque monkey visual area V1 over multiple months using genetically encoded calcium indicators. The researchers developed a technique to inject the calcium indicator GCaMP6f into the monkey's brain and measure the activity of neurons in V1 over a large region of the visual cortex. They found that the GCaMP signals are less sensitive to contrast and more selective to orientation and position than voltage sensitive dye (VSD) signals, consistent with the idea that GCaMP measures the summed spiking activity of neurons while VSD measures the summed membrane potential of neurons. They developed a simple computational model that simulates the relationship between the two techniques and compares well with the measured data. The results suggest that the widefield GCaMP signals reflect the locally pooled spiking activity of layer 2/3 neurons while the VSD signals reflect the pooled membrane potential of neurons. This technique provides high quality access to neural population activity over a large region of the cortex and can be used to study the relationship between signals measured at different spatial scales and with different techniques, which is important for understanding the neural basis of behavior.
The paper discusses how the structure of mitochondria, the energy-producing organelles within cells, is formed and maintained. The researchers found that two different pathways are involved in the formation of lamellar and tubular cristae, which are important for mitochondrial function. They identified three key factors: Mgm1, the dynamin-like fusion protein, F1FO-ATP synthase, and the MICOS complex. The fusion dependent pathway involves Mgm1 fusion of the inner membrane, while the independent pathway involves the influx of proteins and lipids into the mitochondria. The fusion dependent pathway requires MICOS and dimeric F1FO. The researchers found that MICOS is important for cristae formation, but not for the formation of tubular cristae. The loss of Mgm1 leads to the rapid regeneration of cristae, while loss of mtDNA leads to loss of cristae. The study provides a new model for the formation and maintenance of cristae and emphasizes the importance of understanding the three-dimensional structure and molecular mechanisms of mitochondrial architecture.
The authors investigated whether the NUDT9H domain of TRPM2 is an ADPRase, a protein that hydrolyzes ATP to ADP-ribose. They found that NUDT9H, the isolated NUDT9H domain of TRPM2, is not an ADPRase, but instead TRPM2 is a simple ligand-gated ion channel. They generated chimeric models of NUDT9H containing various segments of the NUDT9H domain to test its enzymatic activity. They found that the isolated NUDT9H domain, NUDT9H, is not active as an ADPRase, but the soluble chimeric models generated from NUDT9H sequences are capable of binding ADPR but not exhibiting any enzymatic activity. They conclude that NUDT9H is not an ADPRase and TRPM2 is a simple ligand-gated channel, despite the fact that its ligand binding domain resembles the Nudix enzymes.
This paper discusses the molecular and cellular characteristics of early stage zebra finch embryos, specifically the blastoderm cells, which are the cells that form the early stage of the embryo before the epiblast and hypoblast differentiate. The authors found that the zebra finch bloderm cells at the early stages of oviposition (before egg-laying) are more similar to the mouse blastula stage than the chicken blastula stage, where the epiblast has already differentiated into epithelial cells. The zebra finch bloderm cells have markers of the naive pluripotency, such as Nanog and Pou5F1, which are also expressed in the mouse blastula before the epiblast differentiates. The authors also found that the zebra finch bloderm cells can be cultured in vitro and maintain the naive pluripotency markers in the presence of a MEK inhibitor, whereas chicken bloderm cells require MEK inhibition to express these markers. These results suggest that the zebra finch bloderm cells at oviposition may correspond to the naive stage of embryogenesis, where the epiblast is still undifferentiated. The authors propose that the ability to form epithelial-type adhesive contacts may be present but inhibited at early/mid-blastula stages, and that the pluripotency of isolated cells may relate to the epiblast. Further studies are needed to determine how the pluripotency of isolated cells relates to the epiblast. The paper highlights the potential of using zebra finch embryos for comparative embryology studies, particularly to study the evolution of germ layer formation in amniotes, and the development of avian stem cells.
This paper investigates how brain activity in the hippocampus at an individual's baseline (initial) level relates to the accumulation of beta-amyloid protein over time in older adults. The authors used Pittsburgh Compound-B positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to measure beta-amyloid deposition across time and functional MRI to measure brain activity during memory tasks. They found that individuals with higher baseline activity in the hippocampus at the time of the initial memory test showed an increase in beta-amyloid deposition over time. This increase was found to mediate the relationship between baseline hippocampal activity and memory decline. Baseline beta-amyloid levels were not found to directly influence the increase in hippocampal activity, suggesting that the relationship between baseline activity and beta-amyloid deposition does not simply rely on the level of amyloid. Instead, baseline amyloid levels influence beta-amyloid deposition only when hippocampal activity is high. This suggests that baseline hippocampal activity may be an early marker of risk for Alzheimer's disease. The authors conclude that the influence of baseline hippocampal activity on beta-amyloid deposition is complex and may involve multiple mechanisms.
The paper describes how the authors used MRI techniques to non-invasively image lymphatic vessels within the dura mater (the outermost layer of the meninges) of humans and nonhuman primates. They found that these vessels exist in both humans and primates, which suggests that the meningeal lymphatic system is evolutionarily conserved across mammals. They were able to visualize these vessels using two MRI techniques: T2-weighted fluid-attenuation inversion recovery (T2-FLAIR) and black-blood imaging. They found that gadolinium-based contrast agents could be used to visualize the vessels, which confirmed their presence in vivo. They also performed neuropathological evaluations of human and primate dura mater samples to confirm the existence of lymphatics. They found that the vessels were large and ran parallel to the dural venous sinuses, and alongside blood vessels. The results suggest that lymphatics may play a role in waste clearance from the brain, but more work is needed to fully understand their function.
The paper discusses how the herpesvirus cytomegalovirus (HCMV) establishes latency in human cells, which allows it to remain dormant for years without causing symptoms. The authors used single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze the gene expression in cells infected with HCMV. They found that certain genes that were highly associated with the level of viral transcripts in the cells, including the MHCII gene and the CD74 marker, which serves as an MHCII chaperone. The authors found that cells with higher viral transcripts had lower expression of immune response genes, indicating that the virus likely induces changes in the host cells to reduce immune function. They also showed that cells with higher viral transcripts were more likely to reactivate from latency. They analyzed CD14+ monocytes and found that these cells had an "anergic-like" gene expression profile, characterized by lower expression of immune response genes and a higher ability to reactivate. The findings suggest that HCMV infects certain cells and induces changes that reduce the host's immune function, allowing it to remain dormant. The study provides insights into how HCMV establishes latency and reactivates, which could help in developing strategies to eradicate latent HCMV-infected cells.
The paper discusses the structure and function of the Wnt signaling pathway protein Axin and its interaction with the Dvl and Daxin proteins. The Dvl protein has a DIX domain that forms double-stranded filaments that stabilize the Axin protein, which in turn recruits the Wnt receptor complex and inhibits β-catenin destruction. The Daxin protein has a DAX domain that interacts with DIX domains to form double-stranded filaments, but cannot form inter-strand filaments. The DIX domain of Dvl forms antiparallel filaments that are functionally relevant, while the Daxin DAX domain interacts with DIX to form single-stranded filaments. The DIX-DIX interaction has a weaker affinity than the DIX-DAX interaction. The Daxin DAX interaction is stronger than the DIX-DAX interaction. The paper suggests that the DIX-DIX interaction stabilizes the DIX oligomer, while the Daxin DAX interaction recruits Axin to the receptor complex and inhibits β-catenin destruction. The number of Axin molecules associated with a single receptor is estimated to be around 10, which provides the optimal stoichiometry for efficient inhibition of GSK-3. The authors propose that the DIX-DIX interaction and the Daxin DAX interaction have different roles in the Wnt signaling pathway, with the DIX oligomerization of Dvl providing increased avidity for recruiting Axin and the Daxin DAX interaction providing higher affinity for recruiting Axin.
The paper investigates the mechanism of desensitization of G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) through the removal of specific phosphorylation sites. The researchers found that different phosphorylation sites have different effects on the desensitization of GPCRs. Specifically, the removal of serine sites causes the GPCR to desensitize more rapidly, while the removal of threonine sites causes the GPCR to desensitize more slowly. The researchers found that threonine phosphorylation promotes arrestin-1 binding, which in turn leads to the GPCR desensitizing more slowly. They used genetic experiments to show that reducing arrestin-1 expression in GPCRs with threonine phosphorylation sites causes the GPCR to desensitize more slowly, while reducing GRK1 expression does not have a significant impact. The results suggest that threonine phosphorylation plays a privileged role in coordinating arrestin binding and desensitization. The study provides a biophysical explanation for how different GPCRs with different phosphorylation sites may exhibit different kinetics and sensitivity to desensitization.
This paper discusses how mammals that live underground have evolved differently than those that live above ground. The authors analyzed the genetic changes that have occurred in subterranean mammals such as naked mole rats, blind moles, star-nosed moles, and cape golden moles. They found that genes related to vision and skin are more likely to have evolved more slowly or relaxed constraints in response to living underground. This allowed for changes in eye structure and development that are less important in aboveground mammals. In particular, eye-specific genes showed accelerated evolution in subterranean mammals, indicating that the eye structures were less important for their underground lifestyle. The authors also found that genes related to skin and hair were more likely to have evolved at a faster rate in subterranean mammals, which could help them for digging and burrowing. They also identified genes that show accelerated evolution in subterranean mammals that are specifically related to eye development and were found to be important for eye diseases. Overall, the study suggests that the underground environment has led to genetic changes that allow subterranean mammals to have less developed eyes and skin compared to aboveground mammals.
The authors identified a new family of proteins called StART-like proteins that are involved in transferring lipids between the endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane. They found that a specific type of protein called StART-like proteins called Ysp2p specifically binds to sterols and is responsible for transferring them between the ER and PM. The study found that Ysp2p is localized at puncta in the ER cisternal membrane and can reach across the ER-PM contact sites to transfer sterols. The study showed that Ysp2p is necessary and sufficient for its function, but requires anchoring to the ER or PM to be active. The authors were able to rescue the AmB sensitivity of a deletion strain lacking Ysp2p by expressing Ysp2p variants with a non-steroid sterol-binding domain, indicating that Ysp2p's function is related to its sterol binding. The study also found that Ysp2p's localization to ER-PM puncta defines a novel class of ER-PM contact sites.
The paper describes a new mechanism for understanding how the AcrB-TolC complex, a secondary transport protein in Escherichia coli, harnesses the electrochemical gradient across the inner membrane to efflux drugs. The authors use a combination of structural analysis, molecular dynamics simulations and computational modeling to show that the transmembrane domain of AcrB consists of two repeating 5-helix structures that cycle between three conformations. This motion is coupled to changes in the ionic interactions between the repeats, which in turn drives the conformational changes in the transmembrane domain. Protons are also shown to be coupled to this conformational cycle, with two water channels forming in the transmembrane domain that allow access to the periplasmic and cytoplasmic sides. The authors propose that the alternating access of the transmembrane domain to the periplasmic and cytoplasmic sides allows for efficient efflux of drugs and protons, which is harnessing the energy stored in the transmembrane electrochemical gradient. The authors also show that the coupling between the transmembrane repeats and the porter domain within the trimer is essential for efficient efflux.
This paper studies the evolution of the influenza virus within individual immunocompromised patients. The researchers analyzed the genomes of influenza viruses collected from four patients over several years using deep sequencing, finding that a small set of beneficial mutations repeatedly arise within individual patients and also reach high frequencies globally. They identified 9 sites where the same mutations arise independently in multiple patients. They found that these beneficial mutations arise due to clonal competition among lineages, with a small number of beneficial mutations emerging and competing against one another. They found that the same beneficial mutations also reach high frequencies globally, indicating that clonal competition may be driving global evolution. This suggests that influenza evolution exhibits parallelism across different scales, from within individual hosts to globally. The findings contrast with the limited within-host variation found in prior studies of acute infections in immunocompetent individuals, and highlight the importance of within-host variation for understanding how immune, molecular and epidemiological forces shape viral evolution.
The paper discusses how a protein called Mon1-Ccz1 helps control the process of autophagy in cells by targeting another protein called Atg8 to the surface of autophagosomes, which are structures that form during autophagy. Mon1-Ccz1 has a conserved C-terminal region called LIR that binds to Atg8. This allows Mon1-Ccz1 to recruit a protein called Rab7-like Ypt7 from the cytosol to the surface of autophagosomes, which then triggers the fusion of autophagos with lysosomes. The authors found that Mon1-Ccz1 mutants that lack the LIR region still target Atg8 on autophagosomes but are still able to function in endosome fusion. This suggests that Mon1-Ccz1 has a dual role and two different targeting mechanisms for different organelles. They identified a protein called Atg8 as the determinant that specifically targets Mon1-Ccz1 to autophagosomes. The study provides evidence that Mon1-Ccz1 localization to autophagosomes is dispensable once Rab7/Ypt7 is recruited and bound to a tethering complex, and suggests that different GEFs may be diverted to different locations to control different pathways. The discovery of how Mon1-Ccz1 localizes to autophagosomes provides insight into how different proteins can operate distinct pathways in cells, like autophagy and endosomal maturation, depending on their metabolic needs.
The paper describes a new type of microscope objective lens called the Mesolens that can image large biological samples with sub-cellular resolution. The Mesolens is designed to have a working distance of over 3 mm and a field of view of 6 mm. The lens is corrected for a wide range of wavelengths and is able to image samples that are 2-3 mm thick. The Mesolens achieves this level of resolution by using a design principle that differs from traditional objectives, where the number of lateral resolution units in the field diameter is not fixed. This allows the Mesolens to image samples with sub-cellular resolution throughout their entire thickness. The Mesolens was used to image mouse embryos that are 1-2.5 mm thick and show individual nuclei and other cell structures throughout, where conventional objectives could only image the surface. The Mesolens was also used to acquire 3D datasets of large samples with high optical throughput. The paper demonstrates that the Mesolens can image samples with both high lateral and axial resolution and can switch between a slow laser scanning mode and a fast camera mode with a large field of view. The Mesolens is capable of imaging samples with weak fluorescence signals and rare events, and has the potential to transform optical microscopy.
The paper discusses how the proportion of macrophages in the kidney changes as mice age. The authors found that the proportion of macrophages that originate from the yolk sac increases with age, from around 10% in young mice to over 50% in older mice. They propose two possible reasons for this increase: either the yolk-sac macrophages themselves proliferate or macrophages from outside the kidney are recruited to the kidney. They found that macrophages from the spleen may be a source of these circulating macrophages. The increase in yolk-derived macrophages may contribute to the age-related susceptibility of the kidney to acute and chronic diseases. The findings provide a basis for future studies investigating how age affects the different types of macrophages in the kidney and how this may impact disease susceptibility.
The paper describes a study that used a mouse model to investigate how the parasitic fungus Toxoplasma gondii interacts with neurons in the brain. The researchers found that Toxoplasma infected neurons in the cortex and striatum more frequently than would be expected based on the size of these brain regions. They also found that the infected neurons showed abnormal electrophysiology, such as highly depolarized resting membrane potentials and difficulty firing action potentials, and they died at a high rate. In contrast, nearby uninfected neurons showed only minor changes in electrophysiology. This suggests that the abnormalities in infected neurons are likely due to the parasite directly manipulating them rather than the general inflammatory response. The study also identified that Toxoplasma infects neurons in proportion to their subtype, with the exception of parvalbumin-expressing neurons. The researchers were able to compare the electrophysiology of infected neurons and nearby uninfected neurons, showing that the infected neurons had highly abnormal properties while nearby uninfected neurons had relatively normal properties. This suggests that the general inflammatory response does not drive the abnormalities in infected neurons. The findings challenge the traditional model that neurons must survive infection at almost any cost to ensure their survival. Instead, the death of infected neurons may be a strategy to ensure that the parasite persists in the brain.
This paper reports the results of experiments using optogenetics and electron microscopy to study the rapid endocytosis of synaptic vesicles at the neuromuscular junctions of the nematode worm C. elegans. The authors found that endocytosis occurs at two sites: at the dense projection and the adherens junctions. Vesicles are observed 20 ms after stimulation and are found along the entire face of the synapse, but only docked vesicles can fuse with the plasma membrane. Endocytic structures are observed in temperature-sensitive dynamin mutants. The authors conclude that ultrafast endocytosis at the dense projection and adherens junctions is the likely mechanism for recycling synaptic vesicles. They propose that the readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles is composed of docked vesicles and that the readily releasable pool can be divided into two subpools: the cycling pool and the reserve pool. They suggest that the fast endocytosis at the dense projection and adherens junctions may be an alternative mechanism for recycling synaptic vesicles.
This paper describes how certain molecules can bind to a protein called immunoglobulin light chain dimers and prevent them from forming amyloid fibrils, which are associated with disease. The authors identify two molecules, methylene blue and sulfasalazine, that inhibit the formation of amyloid fibrils by stabilizing the dimer state. They show that these molecules bind to the hydrophobic cavity between the two light chain domains in the dimer and do not bind to monomers. They also find that the molecules do not bind to monomers, which is consistent with the idea that the dimer state is the target for inhibition. The crystal structures of the complexes show that the molecules bind at the cavity between the two light chain domains, but the binding mechanisms differ between the two molecules. While the molecules are not directly repurposed as treatments, the approach of using ligands to stabilize the dimer state may provide a promising approach for treating systemic light chain amyloidosis, a related disease.
This paper investigates how the malaria parasite Plasmodium sporozoites enter human hepatocytes. The authors show that different species of sporozoites use different entry pathways into hepatocytes. Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium yoelii require the host cell receptor CD81, while Plasmodium vivax uses the host receptor SR-BI. They identify the parasite protein P36 as a key factor that determines the host cell receptor usage of sporozoites. P36 mediates CD81-independent invasion by Plasmodium berghei sporozoites. They propose that P36 contains structural determinants that allow it to interact with SR-BI or CD81-dependent receptors on host cells. This discovery may pave the way for the development of malaria vaccines that target the P36 protein.
The paper discusses how developmental changes in the hypothalamus may affect adult behavior. The hypothalamus regulates the body's response to stress and social stimuli through neurotransmitters called oxytocin and vasopressin. The paper shows that zebrafish genetically mutated to lack a gene called otp, which is involved in hypothalamus development, have deficits in social behavior and stress response. The otp mutants have lower levels of oxytocin in a new cluster of neurons in the posterior hypothalamus called the parvocellular tubercle. When the researchers ablated these neurons in zebrafish larvae, they found that the ablation reduced the mutants' social behavior. The authors suggest that the developmental changes in the oxytocin neurons may be responsible for the social behavioral deficits. The paper also shows that the two paralogous genes otp and otp have different effects on the expression of oxytocin in different neuron clusters in the hypothalamus.
The paper looks at the impact of a mass measles immunization campaign in India on measles deaths among children aged 1-59 months. The campaign provided the second dose of measles vaccine to children aged 9-10 years in 14 states with low coverage, while the remaining states provided it through routine immunization. The authors used a nationally representative survey of deaths called the Million Death Study to analyze the data. They found that measles mortality rates among children aged 1-59 months declined significantly after the campaign, particularly among girls. They estimated that the campaign averted between 41,000-56,000 deaths among children aged 1-59 months in 2010-2013, with most deaths occurring in the campaign states. The campaign also led to increased measles vaccination coverage, particularly in campaign states. The decline in measles mortality suggests that elimination of measles deaths in India is possible, although difficult due to the highly contagious nature of the disease. The study provides the first direct evidence of the effectiveness of a national mass measles immunization campaign in reducing child deaths in India.
This paper investigates how human subjects make decisions in a simple state-based sequential decision-making task. The task involves choosing the best move to collect more reward from a set of states, where the reward associated with each state changes over time. The authors found that some subjects replayed states they had previously visited during rest periods, which they could reconsider when they received new reward information. This on-task replay was associated with higher flexibility in adapting to reward changes. The authors also found that off-task replay, where states were replayed during rest periods without feedback, was associated with lower flexibility. They used a MEG signal analysis technique to identify when states were replayed and found that on-task replay was more forward-oriented and associated with improved policy changes. The results suggest that flexibility is associated with model-based planning, while off-task replay may help establish model-free policies. The findings provide insights into the cognitive processes underlying human decision making and planning.
This paper describes how the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa generates cellular heterogeneity through the use of cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP). The researchers used a genetically encoded FRET biosensor to measure c-di-GMP levels within individual cells, which revealed that c-di-GMP levels vary between cells in a bacterial population. They identified that the activity of a specific enzyme called Pch, which is a phosphodiesterase, is responsible for generating c-di-GMP heterogeneity. They found that Pch localizes to the cell pole following cell division and is associated with the chemotaxis machinery, which controls the steady-state activity of c-di-GMP. The researchers showed that c-di-GMP heterogeneity affects cell velocity and chemotaxis behavior, allowing cells to move more quickly and reversally. This suggests that c-di-GMP heterogeneity may be a mechanism by which bacteria generate diversity within populations, which could help them survive in unpredictable environments.
This paper investigates how different Rab GTPases (Rab proteins) are activated and inactivated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase activating proteins (GAPs). It finds that different Rab GEFs use different mechanisms to activate Rabs, despite having conserved switch II glutamate residues. The switch II glutamate in Rabs interacts with the P-loop lysine in the Rab protein to activate it, but the specific details of this mechanism vary between Rabs. Some Rabs have different GEF-mediated activation pathways, and even within the same Rab family, different GEFs can activate different Rabs. Rab5, for example, uses an alternative pathway that involves an acidic residue in the GEF, while Rab3 uses a glutamine residue. Rab switch II glutamine mutants, which were previously used as dominant active forms, are found to be inactive or defective for membrane recruitment and trafficking. The study shows that different Rabs can follow different activation pathways depending on the GEF and GAP they are coupled to, and that switch II glutamine mutations may have different effects depending on the Rab. These findings highlight the plasticity in Rab activation mechanisms and suggest that small molecule inhibitors could be developed to target the distinct pathways. The results also indicate that basal hydrolysis is an important determinant of Rab lifetime and turnover, and that GAP-stimulated hydrolysis may occur in response to specific signals during cell migration and adhesion.
The researchers used multiple techniques to study how tyrosine phosphorylation of a receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) affects signaling in human A43 squamous cell carcinoma cells. They used far-western blotting to measure changes in binding of different SH2 domains to the receptor after EGF stimulation. They also used iTRAQ mass spectrometry to identify phosphopeptides and quantify their abundance. They also used live-cell microscopy to visualize and quantify the recruitment of SH2 domains to the plasma membrane. They found that SH2 binding dynamics in cells lagged behind changes in phosphorylation of specific phosphosites. This delay was more pronounced for SH2 domains that bound GAB1. They proposed that clustering of phosphosites on the membrane could account for the lag in SH2 recruitment. They suggested that this delay could help regulate the duration of ERK activation. They concluded that a multimodal approach is needed to study RTK signaling to identify areas where clustering affects signaling kinetics and develop a theoretical framework to describe this effect.
The paper discusses how apicomplexan parasites evolved from free-living photosynthetic algae. The researchers used genome sequencing of chromerids and vitrella to infer the genes present in the free-living ancestor of apicomplexans. They found that the ancestral genome had many genes involved in metabolic processes like sugar and fatty acid synthesis, which were lost during the transition to the apicomplexan ancestor. However, the ancestor still retained some genes involved in cellular metabolism, which were later lost as apicplexan lineages evolved. The apicplexans gained genes involved in parasitic processes, such as extracellular proteins, cytoskeletons, and DNA-binding proteins. The researchers also found that the chromerid genome contained many proteins that were specific to chromerids but had functional domains similar to those in apicomplexan proteins, suggesting a common ancestor. This suggests that some components of apicomplexan paras were derived from the free-living ancestor. The study provides evidence that apicomplexan paras evolved from a common photosynthetic ancestor, which provided a foundation for host-parasite interactions and further adaptation.
The paper discusses how neurons in the barrel cortex of the mouse brain encode tactile information during active sensation. The authors recorded spiking activity from neurons in layer 4 while mice performed a task of localizing an object using their whiskers. They found that most spikes in layer 4 were temporally coupled to the object touch, with only a small fraction of spikes coupled to the phase of whisker movement. This suggests that layer 4 neurons encode touch information with millisecond precision and minimal noise. The low variability in spiking suggests that the activity of layer 4 neurons is more like a Poisson process than a noisy process, and that the spikes are not driven by internal dynamics of the cortical circuit. This is in contrast to earlier studies that found high variability in spiking in cortical neurons. The results suggest that the brain may use the temporal precision of spiking in layer 4 to perform computations. The authors conclude that layer 4 neurons may encode touch information with millisecond precision, which has not been observed in other studies.
The study aimed to investigate the role of transcription in genetic instability in acute precursor B-cell leukemia. They analyzed genomic data from 138 patients with precursor B-cell leukemia and found that breakpoints in certain genes were more likely to occur in regions with high levels of transcriptional activity. They identified two key mechanisms: 1) convergence of transcription and Pol II stalling, which coincide with breakpoint hotspots, and 2) wide Pol II stalling associates with broad chromatin regions and R-loop formation, which in turn leads to off-targeting by RAG1 and RAG2. The study found that high levels of RAG1 and AICDA expression were distinct between different leukemia subtypes, with high-risk cases showing the highest levels of AICDA expression. The findings suggest that genetic instability may be regulated by transcription-coupled mechanisms, with RAG1 and RAG2 recruitment to R-loops playing a key role. The study provides new insights into the genetic instability in precursor B-cell leukemia and may inform strategies to dampen clonal heterogeneity and relapse risk.
The paper investigates the properties of slow eye movements that occur during fixation, called ocular position drifts, in three rhesus macaque monkeys. The researchers found that these drifts are systematically influenced by visual transients, like changes in brightness or color, and have a short latency of around 80-140 milliseconds. They observed that the drifts exhibit a preference for low spatial frequencies, which suggests that visual responses in the brain's oculomotor system play a role. They also found that the drifts are binocular, occurring in both eyes simultaneously. They showed that the drifts are independent of head movements and are not random walks, but instead have statistics that can modulate the visual input to the retina. The researchers conclude that the drifts are likely generated by mechanisms in the brain's oculomotor system, possibly involving low-level visual responses in the superior colliculus.
The paper describes a new method to detect losses of heterochromatin silencing at the HML and HMR loci in yeast. The method involves expressing a Cre recombinase gene under the alpha 2 promoter at either HML or HMR, which leads to RFP-GFP recombination. The resulting colonies are then imaged to detect losses of silencing. The paper shows that losses of silencing occur at a low rate and are transient, suggesting that silencing is constantly re-established. The study finds that Sir1 contributes to the maintenance or inheritance of silencing, but Sir2 is essential for its initial establishment. The paper also shows that the stability of silencing depends on the Hst3 deacetylase and the deacetylation of histone H3-K56. The method provides new insights into the dynamics of heterochromatin silencing, which is dynamic and can be affected by cellular stresses or environmental factors.
The paper investigates the role of cholinergic neurons in regulating sleep. The authors found that cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain and brain stem activate GABAergic neurons in the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), which in turn induces spindle oscillations and promotes NREM sleep. Previous studies showed that cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain inhibit sleep, but this study found that cholinergic fibers in the TRN actually promote sleep onset and prolong NREM sleep. The authors found that direct stimulation of GABAergic neurons in the TRN also induces spindle oscillations and prolongs NREM sleep. They propose that excitation of cholinergic fibers in the TRN acts on GABAergic neurons through alpha-7 nicotinic receptors to depolarize the membrane and induce bursts of action potentials. The results suggest that cholinergic input to the TRN plays a critical role in promoting NREM sleep and protecting sleep from waking.
The paper investigates the molecular mechanisms of endothelial regeneration in the lung after acute lung injury. The researchers used single cell RNA sequencing to identify and characterize different populations of endothelial cells in the lung at homeostasis and after acute lung injury. They found that a unique population of endothelial cells, termed Car4-high cells, possess a distinct transcriptome and are primed to respond to signals from other cells in the alveolar compartment. These Car4-high cells proliferate after lung injury and are closely related to mesenchymal cells. Proliferating endothelial cells also emerge after lung injury, but the Car4-high cells do not seem to be restricted to a particular subset of endothelial cells. The Car4-high cells express high levels of genes involved in vasculogenesis and blood vessel development and may play a specialized role in regulating gas exchange in the lung. The researchers propose that endothelial proliferation and regeneration after injury may involve multiple subpopulations of endothelial cells, with the Car4-high cells playing a key role in coordinating the regeneration of the alveolar compartment.
The paper describes the discovery of a new type of protein called "thioester-containing domain proteins" (TEDs) found in many Gram-positive bacteria. These proteins are found to bind to host proteins in a covalent manner, forming a continuous bond that provides a strong adhesion site for bacteria to host cells. The TEDs are found in a wide range of bacteria, and the authors propose that this covalent interaction may play a role in bacterial colonization and infection. The TEDs are shown to bind to fibrinogen, a protein involved in blood clotting, suggesting that bacteria may use this interaction to evade the immune system. The study suggests that TEDs may be a common mechanism for bacterial attachment to host cells, and could potentially be targeted for inhibition of bacterial infections.
This paper investigates the evolution of pheromone receptors in moths. The authors find that type I pheromone receptors, which are tuned to specific chemical compounds, have evolved at least twice in the Lepidoptera order of insects. They focus on an atypical odorant receptor SlitOR5, which exhibits a strong male bias in antennae but does not belong to the previously defined "PR clade" of pheromone receptors. Through experiments in heterologous systems, they demonstrate that SlitOR5 is the receptor for the major component of the Spodoptera littoralis pheromone blend. This suggests that type I pheromone receptors evolved independently at least twice in Lepidoptera, and the SlitOR5 lineage may constitute a novel clade of pheromone receptors. The findings also show that most sex-biased odorant receptors in Lepidoptera cluster within the PR clade, while male-biased receptors in the SlitOR5 lineage harbor an equal proportion of male and female-biased receptors. This suggests that the evolution of male pheromones may have occurred independently in different lineages, resulting in diverse types of pheromone receptors. The results provide evidence for a more complex panorama of pheromone receptor evolution in Lepidoptera.
This paper investigates whether the protein annexin 6 (ANO6) is a phospholipid scrambling protein. The authors find that expression of annexin 6 in HEK cells induces calcium-dependent phosphatidyl scrambling of phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. They find that expression of annexin 6 stimulates ion currents that are non-selective and activate phospholip scrambling. They propose that these ion currents are essentially leak currents rather than a separate function of annexin 6 and are linked to the scrambling process. They also find that annexin 6 currents are activated at the same calcium concentrations as phospholip scrambling. They propose that annexin 6 may have a scrambling domain that confers phospholip scrambling activity on annexin 1, but mutations in this domain abolish annexin 6 scrambling activity. They also find that ion currents are not blocked by inhibitors of annexin 1 currents, suggesting that they are carried by the same molecular machinery. The authors propose that annexin 6 currents are essentially flowing along with scrambling lipids and that non-selective ion transport that occurs concomitantly with phospholip scrambling activity may have been a sub-function in the ancestral annexin 1.
This paper investigates whether the formation of nephrons in the developing kidney affects the branching morphogenesis of the organ. The authors examine the relationship between nephron formation and the behavior of tip and capillary progenitor cells. They find that nephron formation does not seem to influence the rate of branching or tip growth in the developing kidney. While some tips have nephrons attached, branching continues to occur in those tips. The authors conclude that the process of branching in the kidney differs from that in the mammary gland and lung, where stochastic cessation of branching is proposed to occur. Instead, kidney branching more closely resembles lung branching, which is driven by reciprocal epithelial-mesenchymal interactions.
This paper discusses the mechanism by which Golgins, a type of protein found in the trans-Golgi network, are able to tether transport vesicles. The authors show that Golgins are not rigid rods as previously thought but are actually more flexible and have a central bubble that allows them to collapse onto the Golgi surface. They demonstrate that the Golgin GCC185's N-terminus is able to bind vesicles and is the key site for tethering, while the C-terminus is anchored by Rab6 and Arl1 GTPases. They show that GCC185's central bubble gives it flexibility to capture vesicles by bringing them close to the Golgi surface. The paper presents a flexible collapse model where the Golgin collapses onto the Golgi surface and brings the vesicle near the target membrane, facilitated by GTPases and other proteins localized there. The results argue against the idea that Golgins behave like simple pipes extending from the Golgi network, instead suggesting a more complex mechanism where multiple binding sites along the protein work together to accomplish tethering.
The paper proposes a new framework called Artistoo that allows researchers to build and share computer simulations of biological systems in a web browser without installing any software. The framework is built entirely in JavaScript and is designed to be zero-install, meaning that simulations can be accessed via a URL without requiring any back-end servers. This allows simulations to be shared and explored interactively by anyone with just a web browser, without the need for local installations or dependencies. The authors argue that this opens up new possibilities for sharing simulations with a broader audience and facilitates communication of complex models in research, education and science. They demonstrate that Artistoo performs similarly to existing frameworks like Morpheus in terms of simulation speed, and can currently simulate a wide range of cellular Potts models. They hope that Artistoo will complement existing frameworks by providing an easy-to-use web-based platform for building and sharing simulations.
This paper analyzed data from 232 Parkinson's disease patients and 17 age-matched controls using diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) to identify brain regions affected in early Parkinson's disease. The authors found that Parkinson's disease patients had atrophy in a network of brain regions that corresponded to a network of intrinsic brain networks identified in healthy subjects using seed-based functional connectivity mapping and independent component analysis (ICA). The PD-ICA network included basal ganglia, cerebellum, brainstem, and subcortical regions, as well as cortical areas like the prefrontal cortex. The authors showed that the degree of atrophy in each brain region was related to its distance from the putamen, which was identified as the likely disease propagator or epicenter. The results support the network-spread hypothesis that Parkinson's disease targets intrinsic brain networks, with the putamen likely being the first affected site. The findings suggest that spatial resolution limitations of the imaging modalities used may have made it difficult to identify atrophy in small brain structures like the globus pallidus and red nucleus. The study provides evidence for the network-spread model of Parkinson's disease progression.
The paper discusses how the protein Histone-like Nucleoid Structuring protein (H-NS) is able to regulate gene expression in Escherichia coli. It has been found that H-NS binds to the genome along long patches and mediates genomic loops, and global transcriptional responses to environmental stimuli. However, the molecular mechanism by which H-NS modulates its function in response to environmental factors like osmolarity and protein interactions is not well understood. The authors investigated how H-NS binds DNA in solution using a new DNA-bridging assay and tethered particle motion experiments. They found that H-NS dimers cannot directly bridge DNA, but instead form stiffened DNA filaments. They showed that H-NS can be "activated" by magnesium ions, which promotes a conformational change that allows the DNA-binding domains to interact and form bridged complexes. They found that ionic effects like magnesium and potassium are most effective at modulating DNA-bridging, while protein interactions like H-NST and Hha can also inhibit DNA-bridging. These findings suggest that H-NS functions through distinct DNA filaments that are structurally and functionally different, but can be modulated by different environmental factors and protein interactions. The paper argues that the complexity of H-NS regulation contributes to the coordinated response in gene expression and selectivity in response to environmental conditions.
The paper discusses the role of a gene called Rspondins in regulating the development of the kidney. Rspondins are genes that encode proteins that promote the proliferation and differentiation of kidney progenitor cells, which are cells that eventually form into nephrons. The study found that Rspondins are required to maintain a healthy pool of kidney progenitors throughout development. Without Rspondins, there is a reduction in the number of nephrons that form and the ability for kidney progenitors to differentiate into epithelial cells. The study identified two types of Rspondins, Rspo1 and Rspo3, which are expressed differently in kidney cells. Rspo1 is expressed in all progenitor cells while Rspo3 is mainly expressed in a subpopulation of cells at the outermost cortex. Rspo3 expression shifts to a predominantly stromal expression later in development. The study showed that Rspo3 is required to maintain stromal progenitors at later stages of kidney development, and that loss of Rspo3 leads to a reduction in the number of nephrons. The study also found that Rspondins act in an LGR-independent manner in kidney cells, meaning they do not require the LGR4/LGR5 receptors to function. The study suggests that changes in Rspondin expression or protein function may be associated with renal diseases, as lower nephron numbers have been linked to hypertension and a higher risk of developing kidney diseases.
The authors studied how the molecule soluble factor LT-1 regulates the growth of blood vessels in the retina and prevents damage to photoreceptors. They found that soluble factor LT-1 is downregulated in the retina of people with age-related macular degeneration and that this downregulation leads to the growth of blood vessels and photoreceptor damage. They created mice that lacked the LT-1 gene to test if this would occur spontaneously in the absence of injury. They found that mice lacking LT-1 spontaneously developed retinal blood vessel growth and damage to the photoreceptors, indicating that LT-1 is required to maintain the barrier between the blood vessels and photoreceptors. They also showed that blocking LT-1 expression with antibodies or gene editing led to blood vessel growth and photoreceptor damage. Their findings suggest that the balance between LT-1 and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) is important to maintain the integrity of the photoreceptors.
The paper describes the discovery of a new cell size regulator called CDKG1 in the single-celled organism Chlamydomonas reinhardti. CDKG1 regulates the number of cell divisions that occur during the S phase of the cell cycle. CDKG1 is produced in late G1 and S phase and is degraded during each cell division, but its concentration is reduced to a critical level during S phase. The authors found that CDKG1 is required for normal S phase progression and cell size control, but not for overall cell cycle progression. CDKG1 expression and degradation is tightly regulated, and loss of CDKG1 function causes a small cell phenotype. The authors propose a model where CDKG1 protein concentration scales allometrically with cell size, and its concentration is reduced during each round of division. This reduction in CDKG1 concentration may be the trigger that signals cells to exit the S phase. The study suggests that multiple CDKs may work together to control cell division, with CDKG1 acting as a limiting factor that determines the number of S phase divisions. The identification of CDKG1 as a size regulator provides insights into how cells control cell size and cell division.
The paper describes a new method to generate organoids, called Somitoids, that can recapitulate the development of paraxial mesoderm (PM) in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). The Somitoids are derived from aggregated hiPSCs in suspension culture and undergo sequential differentiation to form somite-like structures that resemble those found in human embryonic development. The authors identified optimal conditions for generating the Somitoids by screening different cell numbers and signaling factor concentrations. They found that using 50 cells and removing the WNT/FGF agonists after 24 hours of culture resulted in the highest induction of somite-like structures. They also performed single-cell RNA sequencing to show that the Somitoids recapitulate the gene expression programs of human PM development and generate all major paraxial mesoderm cell types. The Somitoids can differentiate into somitic mesoderm derivatives, such as sclerotomes and dermomyotomes, and show similar spatial organization and size to human embryonic somites. The Somitoids provide a scalable, reproducible and easy-to-manipulate system to study the regulation of somitogenesis and the morphogenetic processes involved.
This paper describes a brain-computer interface (BCI) that allows a person with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) to type at a rate of 31.6 words per minute, which is significantly faster than previous BCIs for people with motor impairment. The BCI uses a "point-and-click" approach where the participant clicks a button to move the cursor to a letter and then types a word. Two different algorithms were used to control the cursor and select letters, resulting in high performance. The BCI was tested on three participants, two of whom had no functional arm or hand movements. The results suggest that BCIs have the potential to assist people with paralysis.
This paper studies how zebrafish larvae initiate predatory behavior when they detect prey. They identify neurons in the anterior-ventral pretectum that are specifically activated when larvae initiate hunting, but show no activity when presented with visual cues like small moving spots. These "hunting initiation" neurons are found to be located in a subset of neurons that project to the anterior-ventral pretectum, specifically the ipsilateral optic tectum. The authors show that these neurons can be individually activated with blue light to induce hunting behavior, and that ablation of these neurons impairs predatory behavior. The results suggest that these neurons form a command system that initiates predatory behavior, which is likely linked to visual detection of prey through the retinal ganglion cells in the anterior-ventral pretectum. The authors propose that these "hunting initiation" neurons release predatory behavior while downstream pattern-generating circuits mediate the execution of the hunting sequence.
This paper describes an experiment where the authors used an active learning method to determine how different drugs affect the subcellular localization of different proteins in cells. They constructed a set of 48 proteins that were tagged with GFP and expressed in cells. They then used an active learning algorithm to select experiments to test the effects of the drugs on the proteins. The algorithm was able to learn that different drugs had different effects on the proteins, and identified over 50 distinct phenotypes. The authors then analyzed the effects of the drugs on the proteins by comparing the protein localization patterns in each drug treatment. They found that some drugs generally enhanced secretory localization while others suppressed endoplasmic reticulum localization. The active learning method was able to efficiently identify the effects of drugs on proteins that had not been observed before, without requiring exhaustive experimentation. The results show that active learning can be used to find subtle changes in protein localization caused by drugs, which could help in drug discovery. However, the authors note that the analysis of protein localization patterns was limited due to image quality control and that future experiments could improve this by monitoring the data being collected.
This paper discusses how the protein Stella is involved in regulating the transition from the maternal to zygotic genome during early embryonic development in mice. Stella is a maternally inherited protein that is required for normal embryonic development. The authors used single-cell RNA sequencing to study the effects of deleting the maternal and zygotic copies of Stella in embryos. They found that Stella-deleted embryos have a failure to upregulate endogenous retroviruses, specifically the MuERV-L element, and a failure to properly activate zygotic genes at the 2-cell stage. They also found that chimeric transcripts, which are created by the fusion of a transposon and a gene, are misregulated in the absence of Stella. Specifically, the expression of genes that are nearby MuERV-L elements is strongly correlated with the expression of those elements. The study suggests that Stella regulates the activation of a subset of endogenous retroviruses and chimeric transcripts during the maternal-zygotic transition, and that the loss of Stella leads to developmental defects. The study also suggests that MuERV-L itself may have a functional role during early embryonic development.
The paper describes how a specific neural circuit in the brain of fruit flies helps form long-term memory for appetitive odors. The circuit involves dopamine neurons called protocerebral anterior medial (PAM) and a specific type of output neuron called MBON-alpha 1. The dopamine neurons receive information from odor sensory neurons and use this information to release dopamine that reinforces the odor. The MBON-alpha 1 neurons then provide feedback to the PAM neurons to enhance the release of dopamine, which helps form long-term memory for the odor. The feedback circuit is recurrent and involves a feedback loop between the PAM neurons and the MBON-alpha 1 neurons. The authors show that blocking the feedback circuit during the acquisition or retrieval of the long-term memory impairs the memory, suggesting that the circuit is important for both the initial formation and consolidation of the memory. They also show that the memory is less specific to the trained odor and more generalized, which makes sense from an ecological perspective. The results suggest that a similar circuit may be present in other animals.
The paper describes the structure and function of the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) repeat of the malaria parasite Plasmodium. The CSP repeat is a repeating sequence of amino acids found on the surface of the parasite sporozoite stage of the parasite that is targeted by inhibitory antibodies. The researchers used molecular dynamics simulations and biophysical studies to investigate the structure of the CSP repeat in both Plasmodium and P. berghei parasites. They found that the CSP repeats in both species have low structural propensities and are composed of repeating amino acid motifs. They showed that mAb 3D1, a mouse antibody that recognizes the CSP repeat, binds the repeat in an extended and bent conformation. The researchers also showed that residues that are germline-encoded in the antibody, particularly aromatic residues, mediate the binding of mAb 3D1 to the CSP repeat. They found that homotypic interactions between neighboring Fabs in the antibody complex are important for enhancing the binding affinity of mAb 3D1 to CSP. They also observed that the CSP repeat adopts a spiral conformation upon mAb binding, which is similar to the spiral conformation observed in human antibody-CSP complexes. The findings provide insights into the structure-function understanding of inhibitory antibodies that target the CSP repeat and may help guide the development of malaria vaccines.
The paper discusses how the immune response to COVID-19 vaccines differs between people who have previously had the virus and those who have never had it. The study found that people who previously had COVID-19 have a weaker immune response to the virus after being vaccinated. Their immune cells, called T cells, do not mount a strong response to the virus after the second dose of the vaccine and instead change in their phenotype, showing that they have more long-lived cells that can migrate out of the blood into other tissues. In contrast, people who have never had COVID-19 have a stronger response to the virus after the second vaccine dose, with more cells that can migrate into mucosal tissues. This suggests that people who have previously had the virus may have a more durable immunity that can persist after vaccination. The study used CyTOF to analyze the immune cells of 1165 people, including 111 who had recovered from COVID-19 and 10 who were never infected, and found differences in the immune response between the two groups.
The paper discusses the role of the transcription factor MYC in regulating gene expression. Previous studies have shown that MYC regulates a wide range of genes, but some studies have also suggested that MYC only enhances expression of all genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II. The authors used a combination of biochemical and computational approaches to investigate how MYC regulates genes. They found that direct binding to DNA alone is not sufficient to explain the observed occupancy of MYC binding sites, as there are many non-consensus binding sites. They propose that MYC binding to promoters involves interactions with protein factors like WDR5 and MIZ1, which enhance occupancy. Promoter affinity for MYC confers specificity to gene regulation, with genes showing different affinities for MYC. The authors found that MYC binding to low-affinity promoters is more strongly regulated upon high levels of MYC expression, while genes with high affinity promoters are already fully occupied at normal cellular levels. They propose that genes with low promoter affinity are targeted by MYC when MYC expression increases, and that different MYC levels contribute to tumorigenesis through different mechanisms.
The paper describes how deep sequencing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes can be used to better identify transmission chains and detect super-spreading events in outbreaks, which are important for TB control. Inuit populations have high TB transmission rates. The authors used deep sequencing to investigate a major outbreak in Nunavik, Quebec, Canada, which had 50 microbiologically-confirmed cases between 20111-2, and identified 5 super-spreading events using routine sequencing. However, they found that deep sequencing identified a novel super-spreading event involving one source case that was transmitted to 1/3 of the other cases, which was missed by routine sequencing. This suggests that deep sequencing can provide more detailed resolution of transmission dynamics, particularly in low strain diversity settings. The study highlights the importance of careful analysis and interpretation of within-host genetic diversity to avoid false positives. It also suggests that deep sequencing may be useful for identifying transmission events within outbreaks occurring over short time scales and irrespective of local strain diversity. However, the study acknowledges that deep sequencing is not economically viable for every outbreak. The findings have important implications for TB control in the Canadian North and other regions with high transmission rates, as deep sequencing can help identify transmission chains and super-spreading events that are missed by routine sequencing.
This paper investigates how changes in the gut microbiota during aging in the turquoise killifish, a short-lived vertebrate species, may contribute to the aging process. The researchers found that turquoise killifish have a complex gut microbiota similar to that of longer-lived vertebrates, with a high bacterial diversity. They discovered that as fish age, the gut bacterial diversity decreases while bacteria associated with pathogenesis and dysbiosis increases. Young fish gut microbiota transfer to middle-age fish after antibiotic treatment significantly prolongs life span and improves locomotor behavior. The researchers also identified key bacteria that are associated with young-like gut microbiota and life span. They propose that transferring young gut microbiota to middle-age individuals may be a life span enhancing intervention.
The paper describes how the authors used voltage clamp recordings to measure changes in membrane capacitance to directly detect binding of charged ligands to a membrane protein, specifically the human serotonin transporter hSERT. They found that binding of charged ligands like cocaine and desipramine resulted in a change in the membrane capacitance, which was consistent with the predictions of the Gouy-Chapman model. This indicated that binding of charged ligands to the membrane protein did not result in movement of mobile charges within the membrane electric field, but instead resulted in a change in the outer surface charge density. The capacitance measurements were able to detect binding affinities of ligands to the protein, even those that were not translocated through the membrane. The authors showed that the binding of non-charged ligands like ibogaine could also result in a change in membrane capacitance, which they attributed to adsorption of the ligand to the extracellular face of the protein. The study demonstrates that capacitance measurements can be used to directly monitor binding reactions to surface proteins and provide a more specific measure of binding affinities compared to measuring transient currents. The results highlight the potential of capacitance recordings as a label-free approach to study membrane protein interactions in real-time.
This paper proposes a simple model of cortical network activity that is able to reproduce a wide range of experimental findings from various species and behavioral states. The model has a few key components: excitatory connectivity, inhibitory feedback, adaptation, and tonic input. The authors find that inhibition is the main factor controlling the variability in responses to sensory stimuli, which disappears when inhibition is strong enough to counteract the effects of recurrent excitation. They show that this mechanism is able to explain the observed changes in activity and selectivity during different behavioral states like locomotion. The model provides an intuitive explanation for how inhibition enhances sensory processing and helps to stabilize the network during active behaviors.
This paper used genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and kin-cohort methods to study genetic variants associated with human lifespan. They found that 12 genetic variants were associated with lifespan in a sample of over 1 million parents from UK Biobank, with some variants having a minor allele frequency of 5% or less and effect sizes of 0.35 years of lifespan or more. They found that variants associated with lifespan were also associated with various diseases, such as cardiometabolic, autoimmune, and smoking-related diseases, and cancer. They identified 35 genetic variants that showed independent effects on lifespan, and found that variants associated with cancer protection also associated with reduced lifespan. They found that genetic variants associated with lifespan were enriched for genes involved in lipoprotein metabolism and transport, as expected. They also found that polygenic risk scores constructed from the genetic variants were associated with differences in lifespan, but not with other age-related diseases. They conclude that while genetic variants associated with lifespan are enriched for disease-related genes, the underlying mechanisms controlling lifespan are still unclear and more research is needed. The study demonstrates that genome-wide scores for lifespan have the potential to make material distinctions at a group level, but the individual accuracy is limited.
The authors used a technique called phage display to identify autoantigens in autoimmune polyendocrinous syndrome type 1 (APS1) patients. They used a phage display library of 73,000 peptides representing all human proteins to detect antibodies in patient serum. From this, they identified 69 novel autoantigens that were not previously known to be associated with APS1, including RFX6, KHDC3L, ACP4, and ASMT. They found that these autoantigens were more frequently expressed in specific tissues and exhibited tissue-restricted expression. They found that anti-RFX6 antibodies were associated with diarrheal-type intestinal dysfunction, which is a common APS1 symptom. They also found that many APS1 patients with intestinal dysfunction had anti-RFX6 antibodies, suggesting that RFX6 may be a shared autoantigen involved in immune response to enteroendocrine cells in the intestine. They propose that testing for anti-RFX6 antibodies could be a useful diagnostic marker for APS1-related intestinal dysfunction. The study expands the known autoantigen profile in APS1 and identifies novel autoantigens that could be clinically useful for predicting or diagnosing specific APS1 autoimmune manifestations.
The study investigated how bacteria evolve resistance to antibiotics by identifying mutations in the ribosome that confer resistance to multiple classes of antibiotics. The researchers found that slow growth caused by ribosomal mutations provides an opportunity for bacteria to acquire additional mutations that confer higher level resistance, allowing them to survive longer and eventually become resistant. They identified specific mutations that confer resistance to different antibiotics, such as a frameshift in rplO that restores the reading frame of katG, and the induction of whiB7 that contributes to resistance to cycloserine. Even though the mutations have a fitness cost in the absence of antibiotic, the ability to revert to a wild-type reading frame allows bacteria to easily acquire resistance in antibiotic-free conditions or after exposure to a second, higher level resistance-conferring mutation. The results suggest that a minority of bacteria with ribosomal mutations may contribute to the emergence of antibiotic resistance in complex, multidrug environments, providing a stepping stone for bacteria to eventually become fully resistant.
This paper discusses how the tumor microenvironment influences the metabolism of cancer cells. The authors measured the composition of the interstitial fluid (TIF) isolated from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumors and compared it to plasma to determine how it differs. They found that while some nutrients were depleted in TIF compared to plasma, others were enriched. They identified factors that influenced the composition of TIF, such as tumor size, tissue of origin, diet, and genetic mutations. The results suggest that TIF serves as a separate compartment from the circulation and that metabolic differences between TIF and plasma are influenced by both cell-intrinsic factors and the tumor microenvironment. The authors conclude that understanding TIF composition is important for understanding how cancer metabolism is influenced by factors like nutrient availability.
The paper discusses a new method for forecasting life expectancy based on mortality trends and lifestyle factors like smoking, obesity and alcohol. The authors argue that simply extrapolating past mortality trends is not reliable because it fails to account for differences between countries and sexes. Instead, they use an approach that first identifies the underlying long-term decline in mortality that can be extrapolated into the future, and then projects how smoking, obesity and alcohol mortality will change. They distinguish between the underlying mortality trend and the effects of these lifestyle factors on mortality. By taking into account mortality experiences of other countries and the time-varying impact of smoking, obesity and alcohol, they generate more realistic and robust projections of life expectancy for different countries and sexes. Their approach is more accurate and insightful than previous methods, and generates higher projected life expectancy values than benchmarks and official forecasts. The results have implications for population planning, pension schemes and mortality forecasts, suggesting that life expectancy is likely to increase further, which will impact healthcare needs and social security.
This paper investigates the emergence and spread of a mutation in the pfk13 gene of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum in Guyana, South America. The pfk13 gene encodes a protein called the propeller domain. The mutation, pfk3 C58Y, has been identified in Guyana and has been linked to reduced susceptibility to artemisinin, an antimal drug. The researchers found that the pfk3 C58Y mutation has persisted in Guyana since 2010, despite low prevalence, and that it is confined to a single genetic lineage. They genotyped the pfk1 gene and found that the pfk3 C58Y mutation was confined to a single genetic lineage, which suggests that the genetic background of the parasite may be an important factor in its emergence and persistence. They also found that the pfk3 C58Y mutation reduced the parasite's ability to grow in culture. They introduced two pfk3 mutations, pfk3 C58Y and pfk3 R59T, into parasite lines from French Guiana and found that the pfk3 C58Y mutation conferred higher resistance to artemisin in vitro. The pfk3 C58Y mutation also resulted in a more severe growth defect compared to the pfk3 R59T mutation in vitro. The findings suggest that the pfk3 C58Y mutation has a fitness cost, which may limit its spread. The authors argue that the persistence of the pfk3 C58Y mutation in Guyana may be due to a low recombination rate and a permissive genetic background. They propose that the clonal structure of the Guyana parasite population, with few clonal lineages and low synonymous genetic diversity, may allow the mutation to establish and persist. The study suggests that Guyana has emerged resistance to artemisin and that the clinical and public health significance of the pfk3 C58Y mutation should be evaluated.
The paper describes a new mouse model of a human genetic disorder called hypomyelination-cerebellar atrophy-cerebellar ataxia (H-ABC). The disorder is caused by a mutation in a gene called TUBB4 that encodes a protein that helps form microtubules. The researchers created a mouse model with a mutation in the TUBB4 gene that causes similar symptoms in mice, including hypomyelination and cerebellar atrophy. They found that the mutation causes defects in neurons and oligodendrocytes, leading to progressive myelin loss and neurological symptoms. The mutation affects microtubule dynamics in neurons and oligodendrocytes, which may contribute to the defects. The model provides a tool to study the molecular mechanisms of the disease and test potential treatments. The authors found that the mutation causes both neuronal and oligodendrocyte defects, but the homozygous mutation caused earlier symptoms. The heterozygous mutation did not show early symptoms. The study suggests that the mutation affects microtubule dynamics in neurons and oligodendrocytes, leading to neuronal defects.
This paper investigated how glucose levels impact the development of the heart during embryonic development. The researchers found that high glucose levels during development can promote the proliferation of heart cells but inhibit their maturation. They showed that glucose is metabolized into different molecules like pyruvate, glyceraldehyde-3-3-phosphate, and lactate, which then affect the metabolic pathways of the cells. Specifically, blocking the pentose phosphate pathway, which produces nucleotides, inhibited the glucose-dependent inhibition of cardiac maturation. The researchers found that nucleotides are key to the glucose-mediated inhibition of cardiac maturation. They also showed that high glucose levels during fetal development in mice led to more mitotic cardiomyocytes and delayed maturation of cardiomyocytes in the fetal heart. The study suggests that the glucose environment may play a role in regulating cardiogenesis and that environmental glucose levels may directly impact the development of the heart, beyond genetic factors.
The paper describes a new tool called Growth and Luminescence Observatory for Roots (GLO-Roots) that allows researchers to study the development and response of plant roots in soil. The system uses soil vessels called rhizotrons that are equivalent in size to small pots and support plant growth from germination to maturity. Custom luciferase reporters are used to track root growth, direction, gene expression, and interactions with microbes in the soil. The system also includes a luminescence imaging system that can automatically acquire images of the roots. An image analysis tool called GLO-RIA is used to quantify root system traits like depth, width, directionality, and gene expression. The authors tested the system on Arabidopsis, Brachypodium and Lycopersicon esculentum plants and showed that different plant species have distinct root architectures and responses to environmental conditions. They found that Arabidopsis roots have a steep-angle orientation that allows them to access deeper water resources. This is consistent with previous studies showing that steep-angle roots are optimal for water acquisition. The system may be useful for studying root biology and identifying genetic loci that control root phenotypes, which could be useful for breeding efforts for agriculture.
The paper describes how yeast cells remember past environmental stimuli, like salt exposure or stress, and how this leads to changes in gene expression. Yeast cells have a mechanism called "transcriptional memory" that allows them to quickly turn on genes that were previously expressed after exposure to a stimulus. The paper identifies the molecular mechanisms that allow this memory. Yeast cells have a specialized protein called Sfl1 that helps recruit genes to the nuclear periphery after they have been repressed. This allows the genes to remain associated with the nucleus and be re-expressed quickly when the stimulus is reapplied. The paper shows that Sfl1 is necessary and sufficient to initiate this transcriptional memory. The memory is also associated with changes in histone marks, including H3K4 dimethylation, which recruits a protein called Set3C. Set3C helps maintain the H3K4 dimethylation. The paper also identifies Cdk8+ Mediator as a key factor in this transcriptional memory mechanism. Cdk8+ Mediator helps recruit the poised RNA polymerase II that is required for the memory. The paper shows that the mechanism of transcriptional memory is conserved in yeast and likely in other organisms, although the details may differ.
The paper describes a new model of spasticity in rats that was developed after bilateral pyramidotomy, or lesions in the corticospinal tracts that connect the cerebral cortex to the spinal cord. The lesions caused spasticity in the forelimbs, hindlimbs, and tail, including hyperreflexia, spasms, and clonus. The researchers found that intramuscular injections of Neurotrophin-3, a protein that promotes neuron growth and survival, normalized the spasticity and motor behavior in the rats. They conclude that selective lesions of the corticospinal tracts are sufficient to cause spasticity and that their model provides evidence that corticospinal tract lesions are necessary to produce spasticity in humans.
The paper describes how the RNA binding protein NOVA regulates the levels of transcripts in neurons by both directing the inclusion or exclusion of premature termination codons in their 3' UTRs. This action can either directly regulate steady-state levels of mRNAs through binding to 3' UTRs or indirectly regulate steady-state levels through alternative splicing. The authors found that NOVA regulates a large number of transcripts involved in synaptic function and transport, such as synaptogyrin, Glycine receptor B, and GABA receptor B1. The paper shows that NOVA can bind directly to 3' UTRs and indirectly regulate steady-state levels of mRNA through alternative splicing. The study suggests that NOVA regulates a subset of transcripts that are involved in synaptic function and transport, but the mechanisms are different. The results provide new insights into the role of NMD in regulating gene expression and may help develop methods to manipulate NMD-regulated transcripts.
According to the study, dorsophila dorsophila dorsophila DPM neurons are found to play a key role in regulating sleep and memory consolidation. The study found that DPM neurons release the neurotransmitter GABA which inhibits other neurons in the mushroom bodies (MBs) and promotes sleep. The study also found that DPM neurons do not release the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) and are not excitatory, but instead are inhibitory. The study showed that DPM neurons inhibit the mushroom bodies by releasing GABA through gap junctions, and this inhibition is important for sleep consolidation. The study also found that DPMs are capable of promoting baseline sleep, but the baseline sleep is not dependent on DPM activity during isolated experiences. The findings suggest that DPMs play a role in regulating sleep during arousal states, but are not directly involved in the excitatory recurrent feedback loops that facilitate memory consolidation. The study provides evidence that DPMs are a key component of the coupling between sleep and memory consolidation.
The paper describes a new method called Multiplexed •OH (hydroxyl radical) Cleavage Analysis of Multiple (MOHCA) sequencing that uses radical sources to generate proximity information from RNA molecules. The MOHCA sequencing method was used to generate proximity maps for 10 RNA molecules. The proximity maps were then used to guide 3D modeling of the RNA structures using the Rosetta software. The MOHCA sequencing method was found to be able to provide accurate proximity information for RNA structures at the nanometer scale, beyond what was possible with existing methods like M2 (molybdenum ion crystallography) and MSE (molecular dynamics simulations). The MOHCA method was able to resolve tertiary structures at the 1nm resolution of a single nucleotide, even for RNAs with complex structures. The MOHCA method was also able to identify previously unknown tertiary structures for RNAs. The paper shows that the MOHCA/Rosetta method can be used to model the structures of RNAs without known crystal structures, providing a method to model complex RNA structures.
The authors studied how the protein AMP-activated protein kinase AMPK regulates the behavior of the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans in response to starvation. They found that AMPK is required for the animal to transition from local to distal exploration when food is absent. AMPK regulates the activity of the AIB and AIY interneurons, which receive sensory inputs and control the behavioral responses. AMPK acts through two mechanisms: 1) by regulating the activity of the glutamate receptor GLR-1 in the AIB, and 2) by phosphorylating the MGL-1 receptor in the AIY. The GLR-1 and MGL-1 receptors mediate the effects of glutamate on the AIB and AIY neurons, respectively. The authors showed that AMPK regulates GLR-1 and MGL-1 levels through both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. The loss of AMPK signaling leads to increased activity in the AIB neurons and decreased activity in the AIY, resulting in increased reversal frequency and decreased distal exploration. The results suggest that AMPK acts through a complex mechanism that involves both direct and indirect regulation of the glutamatergic inputs to the AIB and AIY interneurons.
The paper discusses how the brain's blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal during slow wave sleep exhibits apparent propagation of activity between different parts of the brain. This is observed through a technique called lag analysis, which looks at how long it takes for signals to propagate between different voxels in the brain. The researchers found that during slow wave sleep, the brain's BOLD signal propagates in a "front-to-back" pattern, with the thalamus and brainstem showing little change in lag between wakefulness and sleep. However, the cortex shows significant changes in lag between wakefulness and sleep, with some areas becoming earlier and others later. The study suggests that this apparent propagation of BOLD signal activity may correspond to the propagation of slow potentials observed in electrophysiology studies of slow waves. The paper proposes three possible functions of this apparent BOLD signal propagation: consolidation of declarative memory, improved procedural memory, and initiation of dreaming. The study highlights how the brain's communication during sleep is altered, with activity within functional networks preserved but communication between functional networks disrupted. This altered communication may contribute to the loss of awareness during sleep.
In this paper, the authors investigate how humans learn and retrieve well-defined, rule-based memory structures called schemas. They find that the left anterior temporal lobe, specifically the anterior temporal lobe, plays a key role in integrating schemas after consolidation. They trained and tested subjects on schemas over two days, then tested how well they could apply the schemas to new but related information at the end of the second day. They found that the left anterior temporal lobe showed increased activity when retrieving schemas after consolidation. They also found that the left anterior temporal lobe was functionally connected to regions involved in schema retrieval, such as the medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex. This suggests that the anterior temporal lobe may act as a convergence zone for integrating consolidated schema components.
This paper discusses the early events of lymph node metastasis by melanoma cells. The authors found that melanoma cells that have a high level of a protein called Siglec1 on their surface are able to attach to specialized immune cells called sinus macrophages in the lymph node and this allows them to survive and proliferate. This is important for the initial colonization of the lymph node by melanoma cells. The Siglec1-expressing macrophages provide a "soil" for the melanoma cells to grow on. Without this interaction, the melanoma cells would not be able to survive and proliferate, which makes them less likely to metastasize to the lymph nodes. The authors also found that reducing the amount of Siglec1 on the melanoma cells reduced their ability to metastasize to the lymph nodes. This suggests that targeting the Siglec1-macrophage interactions could be a potential therapy for preventing lymph node metastasis.
The paper investigates the role of cortical feedback from the cortex in transmitting retinal waves to the thalamus during early visual development in neonatal rats. The researchers found that cortical feedback from the cortex amplifies and prolongs retinal waves in the thalamus, but its role shifts from a simple amplifier to an active participant in the generation of spindle-burst oscillations during the second postnatal week. During the period of retinal waves, cortical feedback is necessary for the transmission of activity from the retina to the thalamus, but cortical activity after retinal silencing is not sufficient to generate sustained spindle-burst oscillations. The cortical feedback also transforms ganglion cell spiking into spindle-burst oscillations in the thalamus. During the first postnatal week, cortical feedback is limited to amplifying retinal waves, but after eye-opening, cortical feedback becomes inhibitory and can synchronize thalamic activity. The researchers propose that corticothal feedback is a modulatory pathway that develops from an excitatory role during development to a modulatory role in the adult, which accelerates oscillations. The results provide insights into the mechanisms of circuit formation and refinement during development and have implications for understanding genetic and environmental causes of neurological disorders.
The authors investigate how the developmental phase change from oocyte to embryo is coordinated with the translation of maternal mRNAs during egg activation. They find that a protein called GNU, which is phosphorylated at specific sites by the CDK1 kinase, is responsible for controlling the timing of PNG kinase activity. After egg activation, GNU becomes dephosphorylated and binds to the PNG-PLU sub-complex, leading to activation of PNG kinase and translation of maternal mRNAs. This dephosphorylation of GNU after meiosis completion limits the activity of PNG kinase to the narrow window of the oocyte-to-embryo transition, ensuring that PNG kinase activity is constrained to this time period. The phosphorylation of GNU by CDK1 inhibits PNG kinase activity and prevents it from being activated prematurely. The study provides insight into how translational control of maternal mRNAs is linked to cell cycle progression during the oocyte-to-embryo transition.
The paper describes experiments demonstrating that a small number of precisely timed action potentials (less than 50) from a neuron can induce plasticity in a visual cortex neuron, turning it from a non-spiking neuron that does not respond to visual stimuli into a neuron that frequently spikes in response to visual stimuli. The researchers applied a technique called spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), where they paired an action potential with a visual stimulus to induce changes in the neuron's membrane potential. They found that this plasticity is timing-dependent, with the timing of the action potential determining whether the neuron's membrane potential increases or decreases in response to the stimulus. The experiments showed that the changes in membrane potential were broader than expected, consistent with the variability of inputs from neighboring neurons, and that the plasticity could induce rearrangement of the neuron's subthreshold and suprathreshold responses to stimuli. The results suggest that small changes in membrane potential have a significant impact on spiking output and demonstrate a mechanism by which neurons join and leave cell assemblies as proposed by Hebb.
The paper discusses how intrinsic disorder within a protein called AKAP79 helps regulate the activity of an enzyme called protein phosphatase 2B (PP2B). AKAP79 is an anchoring protein that binds to PP2B and regulates its activity. The AKAP79 protein has intrinsically disordered regions that help it interact with PP2B in different ways. These disordered regions allow PP2B to be active at low calcium concentrations and then become more compact when calcium levels are higher, activating the enzyme. The authors used electron microscopy and chemical crosslinking to identify regions within AKAP79 that interact with PP2B and show that these regions help regulate PP2B activity. They found that a region with a specific amino acid sequence called the LxVP motif helps regulate PP2B activity at low calcium levels, while other regions help stabilize the enzyme at higher calcium levels. The LxVP motif also interacts with immunosuppressant drugs that inhibit PP2B binding. The study suggests that the intrinsic disorder of AKAP79 allows PP2B to have multiple modes of interaction with the protein that help regulate its activity, and that the LxVP motif helps tune PP2B activity to match the local calcium levels.
This paper describes how primary whisker neurons in awake mice encode sensory information from exploring objects with their whiskers. The authors used electrophysiology and high speed videography to record the activity of single primary whisker neurons and simultaneously measure the whisker curvature and motion while mice explored a metal pole. They found that while whisker angle predicted spikes for some units, whisker curvature better predicted spikes during active touch and free whisking. They propose that whisker curvature, associated with the rotational acceleration of the whisker, is the main encoding variable. The results provide a mechanical basis for understanding how primary whisker neurons encode sensory information and how sensory encoding varies between active and passive stimulation. The findings highlight the importance of studying sensory encoding in natural, awake conditions and provide insight into how sensory information is processed.
The paper describes a new mechanism by which the protein myosin regulates its function in response to cell cycle and environmental conditions. Myosin is a protein that helps cells move and organize their cytoskeleton. The protein has three domains: an actin-binding motor domain, a lever region and a tail region. The tail region has light chain binding sites and a cargo binding site. The different myosin classes have different functions, but all operate through the same basic mechanism: the motor domain interacts with actin to generate force. The motor domain undergoes cycles with ATP to produce force. The phosphorylation of the myosin motor can regulate its function in two ways: by thin filament regulation and myosin-linked regulation. The paper shows that phosphorylation of the tail region affects the calmodulin binding and conformation of the lever arm. Calmodulin binds the IQ motifs in the tail region and affects the lever arm conformation. When calcium levels are high, calmodulin binds to the IQ2 site, but not IQ1. When calcium levels are low, the light chain binds to IQ1 site, and calmodulin binds IQ2. This switch in light chain binding changes the lever arm conformation and rigidity and modulates the motor function. The phosphorylation of the tail region also affects the endocytic activity and growth of the cell. During vegetative growth, the myosin prefers to bind calcium-regulated calmodulin Cam1, but upon starvation, it binds calcium-insensitive calmodulin Cam2. The myosin's lever arm conformation changes to regulate the endocytic activity and growth. The mechanism provides a simple way for the cell to adjust its function based on the cell cycle and environment.
The paper describes a high-resolution optical tweezers technique that was used to study the activity of the XPD helicase enzyme. The enzyme unwinds DNA by unwinding single-stranded nucleic acids in a step-like manner, one base at a time. The authors found that XPD is an inefficient helicase that frequently backtracks, or moves backwards along the DNA strand, which allows it to unwind the DNA. They propose that XPD unwinds DNA by capturing spontaneously opened base pairs along the DNA strand, but that the frequency of backtracks decreases as ATP concentration increases. The backtracks allow XPD to remain in a state where it can continue unwinding, even at saturating ATP concentrations. The authors developed a minimal model that captures the observed stepping dynamics, which suggests that XPD unwinds DNA in uniform 1-base step sizes, but is inefficient due to frequent backtracks. The backtracks are thought to occur when the translocating DNA strand dissociates from a secondary binding site along the DNA. The authors propose that distinct proteins may play a role in regulating XPD helicase activity.
The paper discusses the mechanism of how the enzyme G40P unwinds double-stranded DNA into single-stranded DNA. The authors use single-molecule fluorescence experiments to observe the unwinding process directly and show that G40P unwinds DNA in one base pair steps. They find that the enzyme has a high affinity to the tracking strand before ATP binding and then moves forward by one base pair after ATP hydrolysis. In the case of a GC base pair, the melting step is slower, preventing the next DNA-binding loop from contacting the next base pair. This leads to a stall in the unwinding process. The authors propose a model where the enzyme moves forward in one base pair increments after ATP hydrolysis and ADP release, but in the case of a GC base pair, the helicase slips backwards. They show that the enzyme has a sequential hydrolysis mechanism and the stall is caused by a single ATP molecule. They also find that the enzyme has a high affinity to the single-stranded DNA in order to synthesize primers for the lagging strand, which hinders slippage. The paper provides evidence that G40P unwinds DNA in one base pair steps, which is the first direct observation of single base pair steps during DNA unwinding for a hexameric helicase.
The paper describes the first structure of a substrate-bound phosphatidylinositol kinase (PIK) active site, specifically the SMG1-8-9 complex that recognizes specific phosphorylation sites on the protein UPF1. The authors used cryo-electron microscopy and mass spectrometry to study how SMG1 recognizes the phosphorylation sites on UPF1. They found that the phosphorylation site is recognized by residues in the catalytic loop and activation segment of the PIK, including a glutamine residue at position +1, which stacks against other residues in the binding cage. They also found that a leucine at position -1 is optimal for the interaction with SMG1. Changing the residue at position -1 to a leucine increased phosphorylation activity. This study reveals the mechanism of phosphorylation site recognition by SMG1 and other PIKs and suggests a mechanism for pseudosubstrate function by the PRD domain in SMG1. The findings provide molecular insights into a key step of the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway and could be extrapolated to other PIKs.
This paper studies how a novel form of cellular communication called "airinemes" helps pigment cells develop stripes in zebrafish. Airinemes are long, thin projections that extend from cells of the xanthophore lineage and can reach other cells, including melanophores. The authors found that airinemes help promote melanophore clearance and stripe consolidation by transmitting a signal from the xanthophore lineage to the melanophore lineage. They identified genetic changes that affect how airinemes are produced and targeted, which likely evolved to help pearl fish develop their uniform stripe pattern. They showed that xanthoblast cells, which extend airinemes in prospective stripe regions, play a key role in producing airinemes that contact melanophores and promote their clearance. Airineme production and targeting were found to be differentiation-state dependent, which likely reflects evolutionary changes that affect the xanthophore lineage. The study provides insights into how evolutionary changes in cellular behaviors can translate into differences in morphological forms.
The authors studied the mechanism of phosphorylation of the discoidin domain receptor domain receptor tyrosine kinases (DDR1). They found that phosphorylation occurs between neighboring DDR1 dimers in trans, rather than within the same dimer. This is distinct from the typical mechanism of ligand-induced dimerization for other receptor tyrosine kinases. Ligand binding induces clustering of DDR1 dimers, which contributes to activation loop phosphorylation and perhaps also to the release of cis-autoinhibition of the kinase domain. Transmembrane domain interactions are required for phosphorylation between DDR1 dimers. The transmembrane domain has the highest propensity for self-association among all RTKs, and mutations in transmembrane helices that weaken transmembrane helix interactions are severely compromised in collagen-induced receptor activation. The authors conclude that the DDR1 transmembrane domain plays a key role in DDR1 activation.
The paper describes how a plant pathogen called Phytophthora infects soybeans by manipulating host proteins that regulate gene expression. The pathogen produces an effector called PsAvh52 that interacts with an enzyme called GmTAP1. When PsAvh52 and GmTAP1 interact, GmTAP1 relocates from the cytoplasm to nucleus. This relocation causes GmTAP1 to increase histone acetylation, which promotes plant susceptibility to Phytophthora infection. PsAvh52 localizes to the nucleus speckles, which is required for its interaction with GmTAP1. GmTAP1 is required for plant susceptibility. The paper shows that PsAvh52 causes GmTAP1 to relocate into the nucleus through its N-terminal domain, which interacts with the N-terminal region of GmTAP1. The increased histone acetylation helps PsAvh52 promote plant susceptibility by upregulating susceptibility genes. The results suggest that PsAvh52 evolved to subvert the normal process of GmTAP1 localization to the nucleus.
Researchers developed new methods to study how retroviruses are restricted by proteins that recognize their capsid surfaces. They generated hyperstable HIV-1 capsids that can be decorated with TRIM5 proteins, and purified pure TRIM5 proteins that could bind directly to these hyperstable capsids. They found that TRIM5 proteins form hexagonal nets on hyperstable HIV-1 capsids, but the nets are less regular and have more flexibility compared to the 2D crystals. They also found that TRIM5 proteins can bind directly to hyperstable HIV-1 cores and decorate them with TRIM5 proteins. They conclude that the flexibility of the TRIM5 lattice may be required to adapt to the variability of retroviral capsids, and that TRIM5 proteins likely activate the ubiquitin signaling cascade that leads to capsid dissociation and inhibition of reverse transcription.
The paper describes the structure and function of the synaptonemal complex, a protein that helps organize chromosomes during meiosis. The synaptonemal complex is composed of two lateral elements and a central element. The central element is made up of four helical chains that form a synaptonemal complex. The paper describes the structure of the central element and how it is organized. It also shows that the central element contains a protein called SYCP3 which binds DNA through its N-terminal regions. The study finds that SYCP3 self-assembles into filaments and can compact chromosomal DNA by tethering together short segments of DNA. This compacted chromosomal DNA helps organize the chromosome axis. The study proposes that SYCP3 self-assembly is key to organizing chromosomes during meiosis, and that its compacted chromosomes have discrete, concertina-like structures. The paper provides the first atomic structure of the SYCP3 protein and provides evidence for its role in chromosome organization.
This paper investigates how cell polarity is established in the follicle epithelium of Drosophila ovaries. The researchers found that the extracellular signaling molecule EGFR is required in the stem cells of the follicle epithelium, specifically in the follicle stem cells (FSCs), but not in their daughter cells, to establish cell polarity. FSCs have a unique apical domain, while their daughter cells, prefollicle cells, lack an apical domain. When EGFR signaling is lost from FSCs, the apical domain is disrupted in both FSCs and their daughters, while constitutive activation of EGFR signaling in prefollicle cells causes the loss of apical domains. The researchers propose a model where EGFR signaling promotes basal and lateral identity in FSCs, while suppressing apical identity, and maintains the apical domain in FSCs. Loss of EGFR signaling from FSCs allows prefollic cells to differentiate and lose their apical identity. They also found that EGFR signaling is required for the maintenance of the niche in FSCs, which is important for FSC self-renewal. The study suggests that the role of EGFR signaling in regulating cell polarity may be an essential part of the program that promotes the segregation of stem cell and daughter cell fates.
The paper discusses the role of lncRNA binding in the protein WDR5, which is a multifunctional adaptor protein that helps regulate chromatin modification. The authors identified a specific lncRNA binding site on WDR5 and found that the ability to bind lncRNAs is important for WDR5 function in vivo. They showed that WDR5 binds to over 1000 endogenous RNAs and that loss of lncRNA binding leads to loss of H3K4me3 levels and reduced expression of genes required for embryonic stem cell self-renewal. They found that the ability to bind RNAs extends WDR5 protein half-life by 12-4 hours, allowing it to maintain chromatin association and MLL complex assembly. The results suggest that lncRNA binding may regulate protein turnover and transmission of epigenetic information across cell generations, and that lncRNAs may play a crucial role in regulating the longevity of epigenetic proteins.
The paper discusses whether transposable elements (TEs) are activated in hybrids. The authors looked at natural hybrid lineages of the yeast species Saccharomyces paradoxus and found no evidence of TE reactivation in any of the hybrid lineages. They conclude that hybridization does not lead to the activation of TEs in these natural hybrids. They suggest that the dynamics of TEs in hybrids are instead determined by deterministic factors like population structure and the properties of the hybrid genotypes, rather than the degree of evolutionary divergence between the parental lineages. The paper argues that this suggests that TE reactivation in hybrids may not play a role in the evolution of species.
The paper discusses how the development of the limb bud of a mouse embryo is regulated by an enhancer called the ZRS. The ZRS is a long-range enhancer that is active in the posterior part of the limb bud where the Shh gene is expressed. The ZRS is initially poised but not transcriptionally active. The ZRS is primed by the early developmental signal FGF, which maintains its poised state throughout the distal mesenchyme of the limb. This priming of the ZRS enables Shh expression in the posterior part of the limb. The ZRS is then activated by factors like GABPalpha, ETV4/ETV5, and HDAC2, which recruit proteins like p30 and H3K27ac. The ZRS exists in two states: poised and active. When the ZRS is poised, Shh expression is restricted to the posterior part of the limb. When it is activated, Shh expression is activated in the entire posterior part. FGFs play a central role in maintaining the poised state of the ZRS, but ETV4 and HDACs can oppose its activity. The study shows that the balance between activators and repressors is important for proper ZRS activation.
This paper describes Hippocampome.org, a resource for integrating and analyzing data on the hippocampal formation in the rodent brain. It aims to accelerate discovery by providing a comprehensive machine-readable inventory of hippocampal neuron types defined by their morphology, molecular markers, and electrophysiological properties. The authors define 100 neuron types based on their axonal and dendritic patterns, with 135 biomarkers identified to support the distinction of 26 neuron types. They also analyze trends in electrophysiological properties among neurons and show that certain biomarkers co-occur with specific properties. They demonstrate the utility of Hippocampome.org by providing examples of how it can be used to determine the properties of unnamed neuron types, find missing data, and analyze connectivity. They also discuss the potential for future improvements, including integrating molecular markers, sequencing data, and optogenetics. The resource provides a standard for what information must be included in publications to link it to existing knowledge.
