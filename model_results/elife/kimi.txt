elife-37443-v3	[L] The research paper discusses how our movements are made up of sequences that are learned through practice, and the cerebellum plays a crucial role in this process. The study tests the hypothesis that the cerebellum can use feedback signals from one movement to learn the next in a sequence. The researchers used rabbits and electrical stimulation to train the animals to perform a sequence of eyelid responses. The results showed that the cerebellum can indeed learn to chain together a sequence of movements using feedback signals, suggesting that the same mechanisms involved in learning single movements can be extended to learning sequences.  [E] The paper investigates the role of the cerebellum in learning and execution of movement sequences, specifically focusing on the sufficiency of feedback signals (FS) for sequence learning. Through a series of experiments involving eyelid conditioning in rabbits, the authors demonstrate that the cerebellum can utilize FS from one movement component as a cue for the subsequent component in a sequence. The study provides evidence that the cerebellar mechanisms responsible for learning single-component movements can be extended to learning movement sequences, offering a general framework for how the cerebellum uses feedback signals to produce correctly timed movement sequences.
elife-33101-v2	[L] The paper discusses the structure and function of a protein complex called mTORC2, which controls cell growth in the body. The researchers used various techniques to study the mTORC2 complex, including crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy, and found that it is composed of multiple proteins that work together to regulate cell growth. They also discovered that a specific protein called Rictor plays a crucial role in the complex's function and is involved in recruiting other proteins to the mTORC2 complex. The study provides new insights into how mTORC2 is assembled and how it carries out its role in cell growth regulation.  [E] The study presents a comprehensive analysis of the composition, architecture, and function of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2), a critical regulator of cellular growth and metabolism. Through the use of biochemical and structural techniques, including cryo-EM and X-ray crystallography, the authors elucidate the mTORC2 complex's subunit organization and reveal its dimeric C2 symmetric structure. They identify Rictor as a key subunit responsible for substrate recruitment and demonstrate that the accessory protein Sin1 interacts with mLST8, suggesting a role in substrate selection. The findings provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying mTORC2 assembly, regulation, and function, with implications for understanding diseases associated with aberrant mTOR signaling.
elife-10806-v2	[L] The paper explores how our understanding of numbers and space is closely connected, as shown by the mental number line where smaller numbers are perceived on the left and larger numbers on the right. This concept is observed in various species, suggesting it has an evolutionary basis. The study investigates how the brain processes numerical and spatial information, which are both linked to the parietal cortex in the brain. The researchers found that visual motion direction can influence our perception of numbers, demonstrating that these recycled circuits responsible for processing numbers still retain their sensitivity to spatial features. This finding indicates that the brain's processing of numbers builds upon, but does not eliminate, its spatial capabilities.  [E] The research paper discusses the neural bases of numerical and spatial processing, which are both localized in the parietal cortex. It suggests that the evolutionary concept of 'cortical recycling' has led to the development of numerical cognition using circuits originally intended for spatial processing. The study presents a new phenomenon where visual motion direction impacts numerosity, creating a repulsive aftereffect that demonstrates the co-opting of spatial processing circuits for numerosity. The results indicate that the cross-adaptation effect occurs in a spatiotopic frame of reference, specifically in an area homologous to the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) in humans. This finding supports the idea that 'cortical recycling' expands upon original neural functionalities without replacing them, establishing a functional link between different domains. The study also proposes that the opponent coding model can explain the observed effects, which has implications for understanding number processing and could potentially aid in the early identification of dyscalculia.
elife-02848-v2	[L] The study explores the role of the RNA-binding protein Musashi-1 (MSI1) in stem and progenitor cells, particularly in the central nervous system. It reveals that MSI1 is crucial for neural development, with a lack of MSI1 in mice leading to severe developmental issues. The research also delves into MSI1's interaction with monounsaturated fatty acids, demonstrating that these acids can inhibit MSI1's function. This discovery could have significant implications for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying stem cell behavior and neural development.  [E] This paper investigates the Musashi-1 (MSI1) RNA-binding protein's function in neural and epithelial stem cells, highlighting its critical role in neurogenesis and gliogenesis. The study identifies MSI1 as a potential stem cell marker and explores its regulation by monounsaturated fatty acids, specifically oleic acid. Through a high-throughput screening process, the researchers characterize the specificity and mechanism of oleic acid inhibition of MSI1 RNA-binding activity, suggesting a novel regulatory role for MSI1 as a metabolite sensor. The findings provide valuable insights into the molecular interactions governing stem cell proliferation and differentiation, with implications for developmental neuroscience and potential therapeutic applications.
elife-01524-v1	[L] The research paper discusses the role of a protein called Syt7 in the process of synaptic transmission in the brain. The study, conducted on mice, found that Syt7 acts as a calcium sensor regulating the replenishment of synaptic vesicles, which are crucial for the transmission of signals between neurons. The researchers used various methods, including electrophysiological recordings and imaging techniques, to examine the function of Syt7. They discovered that without Syt7, the replenishment process is slower, leading to faster depression or reduced activity of synapses. The study also revealed that another protein, CaM, interacts with Syt7 to regulate this process. The findings provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms of synaptic transmission, which could have implications for understanding and treating neurological disorders.  [E] The study investigates the physiological function of Syt7, a synaptotagmin isoform, in short-term synaptic plasticity. The researchers used Syt7 knock-out (KO) mice and various electrophysiological and imaging techniques to probe the role of Syt7 in synaptic transmission and vesicle replenishment. The results indicate that Syt7 acts as a Ca2+ sensor for synaptic vesicle replenishment during high-frequency stimulation. Moreover, the study reveals a specific interaction between Syt7 and the calcium-binding protein CaM, suggesting a complex formed between these two proteins regulates Ca2+-dependent vesicle replenishment. The findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying short-term synaptic plasticity and may have implications for understanding synaptic dysfunction in neurological diseases.
elife-14137-v1	[L] The paper discusses the potential of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors as a novel treatment for mood and anxiety disorders. The authors highlight the limitations of current pharmacological therapies, which are only partially effective, and explore new non-monoaminergic pathophysiological mechanisms. They focus on COX-2, an enzyme involved in the production of inflammatory prostaglandins, and its potential role in the immune hyperactivity hypothesis of depression. The study finds that COX-2 inhibitors, including a newly developed substrate-selective COX-2 inhibitor (SSCI) called LM-4131, can reduce stress-induced anxiety-like behavior in mice without affecting other behaviors, suggesting a possible new therapeutic approach for stress-related neuropsychiatric conditions.  [E] The research paper investigates the therapeutic potential of COX-2 inhibition in the context of mood and anxiety disorders, noting the limitations of existing monoaminergic-focused pharmacotherapy. It delves into the role of COX-2 in the synthesis of inflammatory prostaglandins and its implication in the immune hyperactivity hypothesis of depression. The study examines the efficacy of COX-2 inhibitors, with a particular focus on a newly synthesized SSCI, LM-4131, in mitigating stress-induced anxiety-like states in mice. The findings indicate that COX-2 inhibition, including that of LM-4131, can attenuate stress-induced anxiety without impacting other behavioral measures, thereby supporting the potential of COX-2 inhibitors as a novel treatment avenue for stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders. The paper further explores the mechanisms underlying these effects, suggesting a possible role for endocannabinoid signaling and SK channel modulation.
elife-34085-v1	[L] The paper presents a new method called the "peptidisc" for stabilizing membrane proteins, which are essential for various cellular functions but difficult to work with. The peptidisc is made up of a peptide that wraps around the membrane protein, and it does not require additional lipids or detergents. The researchers show that the peptidisc is effective for stabilizing different types of membrane proteins and can be used for various applications, such as studying their structure and function.  [E] The paper introduces a novel peptide-based reconstitution method called the "peptidisc" for the stabilization of membrane proteins, which play critical roles in cellular processes. Traditional methods for purifying and handling membrane proteins often involve the use of detergents, which can be detrimental to the proteins' structure and function. The peptidisc method involves the use of an amphipathic bi-helical peptide (NSPr) that wraps around the target membrane protein, eliminating the need for additional lipids or detergents. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the peptidisc for stabilizing both α-helical and β-barrel membrane proteins of varying size, topology, and complexity. The method offers several advantages, including cost-effectiveness, rapidity, and solubility, and may provide a practical approach for the analysis and exploitation of membrane proteins in a detergent-free environment.
elife-54898-v1	[L] The paper discusses the issue of transcript errors, which are inconsistencies between RNA transcripts and their corresponding genomic loci. These errors can lead to various problems, including the inactivation of proteins and the production of misfolded proteins, ultimately affecting cellular integrity and fitness. The researchers used a method called rolling-circle amplification-based sequencing (CirSeq) to identify transcript errors in prokaryotes, revealing that these errors are much more common than genetic mutations. The study also found that the types of errors and their distribution across genes are influenced by the RNA polymerases and the concentrations of RNA nucleotides in the cell. The results provide new insights into the mechanisms of RNA quality control in prokaryotes.  [E] The study investigates transcript errors in prokaryotes using a rolling-circle amplification-based sequencing (CirSeq) method, which allows for the identification of errors at a large scale. The researchers discovered a high prevalence of transcript errors in four bacterial species, with error rates several orders of magnitude higher than the corresponding genomic mutation rates. The molecular spectrum of errors revealed a general bias towards transitions over transversions, with the highest error rates observed in M. florum. The study also suggests the presence of a Nonsense-Mediated Decay-like process in prokaryotes, which may contribute to the degradation of mRNAs carrying nonsense errors. Overall, the findings provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of RNA quality control and the factors influencing transcript error rates in prokaryotic organisms.
elife-01273-v1	[L] The study investigates how individuals adapt to the loss of a hand and the role brain plasticity plays in this adaptation. The research involved individuals with either congenital (present from birth) or acquired (lost later in life) hand absence. The study aimed to understand how these individuals use their remaining limbs in daily life and how this use affects the brain's structure and function. The findings suggest that the way people use their limbs influences the brain's ability to reorganize itself following the loss of a hand, which could have implications for the development of future rehabilitation strategies.  [E] This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into the adaptive plasticity of the adult human brain following hand absence, either congenital or acquired. The study utilised a combination of physiological measurements and neuroimaging techniques, including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), to examine the cortical reorganisation and white matter connectivity associated with altered limb-use patterns in individuals with unilateral hand absence. The findings reveal that the degree of cortical reorganisation within the deprived cortex is contingent upon the individual's limb-use strategy, rather than the age at which the hand was lost. This suggests that adaptive plasticity in the adult brain may be more extensive than previously thought, with implications for the design of future neurorehabilitation approaches aimed at improving limb function in individuals with upper limb absence.
elife-51581-v1	[L] The paper discusses the evolution of long bones in tetrapods, focusing on the development and biomechanics of these bones and their role in producing blood cells through bone marrow. The study examines various fossil specimens, including those of Apateon, Metoposaurus, Seymouria, and Discosauriscus, to understand the early evolution of bone marrow and long-bone growth. The findings suggest that the elongation process of long bones in tetrapods has both primitive and derived features, with some species exhibiting amniote-like elongation and others having unique traits. The study also explores the role of bone marrow in different tetrapod groups and finds that the function of bone marrow in producing blood cells has evolved over time.  [E] This scientific paper investigates the early evolution of long-bone elongation and bone-marrow roles in tetrapods by analyzing various fossil specimens, including Apateon, Metoposaurus, Seymouria, and Discosauriscus. The study uses three-dimensional virtual histology and traditional thin-section histology to examine the microanatomy of these specimens and provides insights into the evolution of long-bone growth plates and marrow processes. The results reveal a mix of primitive and derived traits in the studied taxa, with some exhibiting amniote-like elongation processes and others displaying unique characteristics. The paper also discusses the role of bone marrow in blood cell production and its evolution across different tetrapod groups, highlighting the complex interplay between skeletal development and hematopoiesis in the evolutionary history of these animals.
elife-59709-v2	[L] The study investigates the impact of long-term alcohol consumption on stress responses in mice. The researchers used a predator odor stressor and found that mice who had been drinking alcohol showed reduced avoidance and burying behavior, which are typical stress coping mechanisms. They also found that the mice had increased activity in certain brain regions associated with stress and anxiety. The study suggests that long-term alcohol use may change the way the brain responds to stress and could lead to increased anxiety-like behavior.  [E] The research paper presents a comprehensive investigation into the neurobiological consequences of chronic alcohol consumption on stress reactivity, focusing on the role of the neuropeptide prodynorphin (Pdyn) and its receptor, the kappa opioid receptor (KOR), in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). The study utilized a predator odor stressor, trimethylthiazoline (TMT), to elicit stress responses in C57BL/6J mice following prolonged alcohol exposure. The findings indicate that alcohol-drinking mice exhibited attenuated stress coping behaviors, including reduced avoidance and burying in response to TMT, and increased anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze. The study further explored the synaptic plasticity of BNST Pdyn neurons and identified a role for cortical inputs in modulating these behaviors. The results suggest that chronic alcohol consumption leads to enduring changes in stress reactivity and prefrontal cortical-BNST connectivity, potentially contributing to alcohol use disorder. The study highlights the therapeutic potential of targeting KOR signaling in the BNST for improving stress coping in individuals with alcohol use disorder.
elife-03164-v1	[L] This paper investigates the role of a protein called eEF1A1 in the heat shock response (HSR), a process that helps cells cope with stress by producing protective proteins. The researchers found that eEF1A1 is crucial for the production of a specific protective protein called HSP70. The study shows that eEF1A1 helps to increase the stability, transport, and translation of HSP70 mRNA, which ultimately leads to a more efficient production of the HSP70 protein. The results suggest that eEF1A1 plays a key role in synchronizing the different steps of HSR, making it a potential target for treating diseases related to the deregulation of this response.  [E] This study demonstrates that the translation elongation factor eEF1A1 is a critical component of the heat shock response (HSR) and is required for the efficient induction of HSP70, a molecular chaperone protein that protects cells from stress. The researchers found that eEF1A1 is involved in each stage of HSP70 expression, including transcription activation, mRNA stability, nuclear transport, and translation. The study reveals that eEF1A1 interacts with the transcription factor HSF1 and the RNA polymerase II elongation complex, and is essential for the stabilization and transport of HSP70 mRNA. The findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of HSR and suggest that eEF1A1 may be a promising target for therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating this response in various pathological conditions.
elife-09269-v2	[L] The paper discusses the importance of flowers in plant reproduction and how a specific hormone, auxin, controls their growth. It explains that auxin helps switch stem cells into flower-producing cells by promoting a local increase in a hormone called auxin and the activity of a specific protein called MONOPTEROS (MP). However, it was unclear how MP could work effectively in a tightly packed environment. The study found that MP helps recruit special proteins called SWI/SNF ATPases to 'unlock' the tightly packed area and allow other proteins to access the genes needed for flower growth. This process is tightly controlled by another set of proteins called Aux/IAA, which only allow this 'unlocking' to happen when auxin is present. The findings provide a better understanding of how plants control the growth of flowers and could potentially help improve crop yields.  [E] The study elucidates the molecular mechanisms underlying auxin-directed transcriptional reprogramming and cell fate transformation during flower primordium initiation in plants. It reveals a crucial role for the AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR (ARF) protein, MONOPTEROS (MP), in recruiting SWI/SNF ATPases, which are chromatin remodelers, to overcome the repressive chromatin state at MP target loci. The research demonstrates that MP-anchored chromatin unlocking by SWI/SNF ATPases is essential for the transition from transit amplifying to primordium founder cell fate. Furthermore, the study shows that unlicensed chromatin remodeling at MP target loci is prevented by auxin-sensitive Aux/IAA proteins, which physically block chromatin remodeler recruitment when complexed with MP. The findings provide novel insights into the auxin-controlled cell fate reprogramming events and have implications for understanding the regulation of developmental processes in plants.
elife-07839-v2	[L] The paper discusses a study on myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), a group of disorders characterized by abnormal blood production. The researchers focused on the impact of a specific chromosomal abnormality, called -7/del(7q), which is commonly found in MDS patients. They created mice with a similar genetic change and observed that these mice had abnormal blood cell production, particularly affecting the production of a type of cell called hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). The study provides evidence that this chromosomal abnormality contributes to the development of MDS and offers a potential model for further research into the condition.  [E] The paper presents a comprehensive investigation into the role of -7/del(7q) chromosomal abnormalities in the pathogenesis of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), a group of clonal stem cell disorders. The authors generated a mouse model carrying a 2 Mb germline deletion syntenic to the human 7q22 commonly deleted segment (CDS), which is frequently observed in MDS and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. The study demonstrates that this deletion leads to perturbations in steady-state hematopoiesis, characterized by an increased proportion of CD150hi HSCs and a reduced frequency of CD150neg multipotent progenitors. Furthermore, the 5A3+/del mice exhibited impaired lymphoid repopulating potential but maintained efficient myeloid reconstitution capabilities. Transcriptome analysis revealed a significant downregulation of genes associated with oxidative phosphorylation, a key metabolic pathway, providing a potential mechanism for the observed hematopoietic abnormalities. The findings support a haploinsufficient role of 7q22 deletions in MDS leukemogenesis and provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease.
elife-04660-v2	[L] The paper discusses the complexity and diversity of the somatosensory nervous system, which is responsible for sensations such as touch, pain, and temperature. The authors used various techniques to identify and analyze different types of sensory neurons, and they found that there are many more subtypes than previously thought. They also discovered new molecular markers that could help in understanding the specific functions of these neurons. This research could have implications for understanding and treating diseases related to the somatosensory system.  [E] The study presents a comprehensive transcriptional profiling of somatosensory neurons, revealing a high degree of molecular complexity and identifying numerous novel neuronal subtypes. The authors performed population-level analysis of three major classes of somatosensory neurons and single-cell analysis of hundreds of cells, uncovering at least six distinct neuronal subgroups. The findings challenge the current classification of sensory neurons and provide new insights into their functional specialization and potential roles in disease.
elife-30789-v2	[L] The paper discusses the process of meiosis, which is when special cells called gametes are made. These gametes have half the number of chromosomes compared to normal cells. A key part of meiosis is making sure that each pair of chromosomes exchange pieces so they can connect properly. This exchange is called a crossover. The researchers found certain proteins, called ZHP proteins, that help control where these crossovers happen and how they're formed. The ZHP proteins work together to make sure the right number of crossovers occur and that the chromosomes are prepared correctly for the next steps in meiosis.  [E] The study elucidates the mechanisms governing crossover formation and chromosome segregation during meiosis in C. elegans. The authors identify and characterize four ZHP RING finger proteins (ZHP-1 to ZHP-4) that function as two heterodimeric complexes to regulate crossover formation. These ZHP proteins localize to the synaptonemal complex (SC), a protein structure that forms between homologous chromosomes during meiosis, and are involved in both crossover assurance and interference. The ZHP proteins also play a role in the spatial regulation of cohesin function and chromosome remodeling in response to crossover designation. The findings suggest that the ZHP proteins act as a signaling network within the SC to ensure proper chromosome segregation during meiosis.
elife-59885-v3	[L] The research paper discusses the process of mitotic exit, which is the final stage of a cell cycle where new cells are formed. The study focuses on the role of protein degradation and dephosphorylation in this process. The researchers used high-resolution mass spectrometry to analyze changes in protein abundance and phosphorylation during mitotic exit. They found that while protein degradation plays a crucial role in triggering mitotic exit, it is the dephosphorylation process that coordinates the sequence of events leading to the formation of new cells. The study also revealed that the destruction of a single protein, cyclin B, triggers a series of dephosphorylation reactions that are essential for progression through mitotic exit.  [E] The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the regulatory mechanisms involved in mitotic exit, highlighting the complex interplay between ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis and protein dephosphorylation. The authors demonstrate that despite the dramatic changes in cell morphology and genome packaging during mitotic exit, the process is primarily orchestrated by regulated dephosphorylation rather than proteolysis. They propose a model where the destruction of cyclin B triggers a graded series of dephosphorylations, with the rate of these dephosphorylations being encoded by the amino acid sequence surrounding each phospho-site. The study also challenges the previous notion that ongoing protein synthesis and turnover are essential for mitotic exit, showing that inhibition of protein synthesis does not affect the stability of the total proteome or the progression through anaphase. The findings provide significant insights into the cell cycle control and suggest potential targets for therapeutic interventions in diseases associated with cell cycle dysregulation.
elife-08752-v1	[L] The research paper discusses Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), a mental health condition that affects around 16% of the global population. MDD is characterized by a lack of motivation, reduced ability to enjoy rewards, and sleep and appetite abnormalities. The study suggests that MDD occurs due to a combination of genetic, environmental, and biological factors. The paper highlights that while treatments exist, the impact of environmental factors on neural circuits and their role in behavior is not fully understood. The researchers focused on the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a brain region involved in controlling emotive behaviors and stress responses. They found that a specific population of neurons in the mPFC, which express the Wolfram syndrome gene (Wfs1), play a critical role in stress-induced depressive behaviors. The loss of Wfs1 in these neurons leads to enhanced stress responses and depressive behaviors in animals. The study provides insights into the neural mechanisms of MDD and suggests potential therapeutic targets.  [E] The research investigates the role of the Wolfram syndrome gene (Wfs1) in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) by employing bacTRAP translational profiling and virus-mediated trans-synaptic tracing studies. The study identifies a specific population of neurotrophin 3 (Ntf3) and proenkephalin (Penk1) expressing pyramidal cells in the superficial layer 2/3 of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) that express Wfs1. These cells receive projections from other cortical structures, the posterior thalamic nuclear group, and the lateral amygdala. Deletion of Wfs1 in forebrain neurons of conditional knockout mice (Wfs1/CKO) alters stress-induced depression-related behaviors, induces the expression of the immediate early gene Fos in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus, and results in enhanced accumulation of serum corticosterone. The study demonstrates that superficial layer 2/3 pyramidal cells in the mPFC play a critical role in stress-induced depressive behaviors and suggests that dysfunction of Wfs1 in forebrain neurons leads to activation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis and elevated blood corticosterone levels. The findings provide insights into the neural circuits involved in MDD and highlight potential therapeutic targets for treatment.
elife-57180-v1	[L] The research paper discusses the importance of protein function in living organisms and focuses on a specific protein called Hsp90. The study investigates how changes in the protein's structure, modifications, and interactions with other molecules affect its function. The researchers used a variety of techniques to observe these changes and found that even non-specific interactions can have a significant impact on the protein's activity. The results suggest that conformational changes in proteins play a crucial role in their function and regulation.  [E] The study presents a comprehensive investigation into the diverse regulation mechanisms of the chaperone protein Hsp90, which is involved in the maturation of a significant portion of the cellular proteome. Utilizing single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) measurements, the authors dissect the effects of a point mutation (A577I), the interaction with the co-chaperone Aha1, and macro-molecular crowding on Hsp90's conformational dynamics, function, and kinetics. The results reveal that all three modulations lead to an increase in Hsp90's closed conformation and ATPase activity, highlighting the importance of conformational confinement in protein regulation. The findings provide valuable insights into the dynamic structure-function relationship in proteins and have implications for understanding protein function in diverse systems.
elife-11611-v2	[L] The paper discusses how yeast cells ensure the establishment of a single bud site by examining the mechanisms of competition and stabilization of cortical domains, which are key in generating specialized cell functions. The researchers found that the cell's ability to form only one bud is due to a competition between potential bud sites for common resources, rather than a stabilizing factor that locks in the position of the bud. By slowing down the exchange of key proteins between the bud site and the rest of the cell, multiple bud sites can form, providing insight into how cells guarantee the uniqueness of the bud site. [E] The study investigates the mechanism by which budding yeast cells establish a single polarity site, focusing on the interplay between competition for polarity factors and stabilizing factors. The findings suggest that the uniqueness of the yeast front is primarily due to competition for polarity factors, and not to a downstream stabilizer. The researchers demonstrate that altering the rates of key polarity factors exchange can manipulate the speed of competition, allowing cells to form multiple fronts and buds simultaneously. This provides a deeper understanding of the yeast cell polarity establishment process and the critical role of factor competition in ensuring the correct number of bud sites.
elife-00067-v1	[L] The paper discusses the role of a protein called RecA in repairing damaged DNA. RecA helps in a process known as homologous recombination, which is a way to fix double strand breaks in DNA. The paper reveals that RecA can slide along DNA, which helps it quickly find matching sequences of DNA. This sliding ability was observed using a technique called single molecule FRET, which allows the researchers to watch individual RecA proteins interacting with DNA. The study suggests that this sliding motion could speed up the repair of DNA damage.  [E] The research paper presents an investigation into the mechanism of DNA repair facilitated by the protein RecA. The study uncovers that RecA, which is involved in the strand exchange reaction during double strand break repair, can mediate homology search by sliding along double stranded DNA. This sliding is primarily driven by electrostatic interactions and can occur even in the presence of non-homologous DNA. The sliding motion is demonstrated using single molecule Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) measurements, showing that RecA can rapidly fluctuate between different binding states. Furthermore, the study confirms that homology recognition and base pairing can occur during this sliding process, and that even short stretches of homologous sequences can significantly enhance the efficiency of this search process. The findings suggest a potential paradigm for other protein complexes involved in DNA repair and target search processes.
elife-02674-v2	[L] The paper discusses the Human metapneumovirus (HMPV), a virus that causes respiratory infections, and its replication process. The researchers focused on the M2-1 protein, which is crucial for the virus's ability to infect cells. They used various techniques, including X-ray crystallography and electron microscopy, to study the structure of this protein and its interaction with RNA. The study found that M2-1 can switch between open and closed forms, and this change is triggered by binding to RNA. The researchers proposed a model where M2-1 recognizes specific sequences on the RNA and changes its shape to bind to it, preventing the virus from terminating transcription prematurely. This insight could help in the development of antiviral drugs.  [E] The study elucidates the dynamic structural equilibrium of the HMPV M2-1 protein, which fluctuates between open and closed conformations. This dynamic behavior is central to the protein's function in the viral life cycle, as it allows M2-1 to recognize and bind to specific RNA sequences, thereby preventing premature termination of transcription. The researchers employed X-ray crystallography, small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and electron microscopy to reveal the structural details of M2-1 and its interaction with RNA. The findings suggest a model where M2-1, through its zinc finger and core domains, recognizes a consensus gene end sequence on the RNA, inducing a conformational change that stabilizes the protein-RNA complex. This work contributes to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying HMPV replication and offers potential targets for antiviral therapeutics.
elife-28862-v1	[L] The research paper discusses the role of chloride ions in the functioning of lysosomes, which are cellular organelles responsible for breaking down waste materials and cellular debris. The study uses a DNA-based fluorescent reporter called Clensor to measure lysosomal chloride levels in live multicellular organisms and in vitro cell models. The findings reveal that lysosomal chloride concentrations are significantly higher than previously thought and are crucial for the organelle's degradative function. In lysosomal storage disorders, where lysosomes fail to break down materials properly, lysosomal chloride levels are found to be severely depleted. The study suggests that high lysosomal chloride is necessary for effective lysosomal function, including the release of calcium from the lysosome, which is implicated in various cellular processes.  [E] The paper presents a comprehensive investigation into the regulation and functional significance of chloride ions within lysosomes. Utilizing a sophisticated DNA-based fluorescent sensor (Clensor), the researchers quantitatively mapped lysosomal chloride concentrations in vivo, demonstrating that these ions are tightly regulated and play a critical role in lysosomal degradation processes. The study identified a direct correlation between lysosomal chloride levels and the degradative capacity of the lysosome, with depletion of chloride leading to a loss of functionality. Moreover, the research uncovered that in lysosomal storage disorders, lysosomal chloride concentrations are大幅 reduced, suggesting a potential diagnostic application for chloride measurements. The findings also imply a broader mechanistic role for chloride ions in lysosome function beyond merely balancing cation fluxes, indicating the need for further exploration into the complex interplay between chloride, lysosomal pH, and enzymatic activity.
elife-03222-v2	[L] The research paper explores how monkeys use facial cues, such as head gaze, to understand the attention focus of another monkey and shift their own attention accordingly. The study involved two rhesus monkeys who were trained to follow the gaze of a portrayed monkey to identify a spatial target. The researchers used functional MRI (fMRI) to identify specific brain regions in the superior temporal sulcus (STS) that were activated during this 'gaze following' task. They found a distinct patch of brain activity, referred to as the 'gaze following (GF) patch', which was separate from areas known to process facial identity. The results suggest that this GF patch may be involved in geometric calculations needed to translate another monkey's head orientation into precise shifts of attention. The study also found some evidence of hemispheric specialization in the brain for processing gaze following cues.  [E] The study investigates the neural substrates involved in gaze following behavior in rhesus monkeys by employing a combination of behavioral tasks and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Monkeys were trained to perform a gaze following task, using head gaze orientation to identify a spatial target, and an identity-matching task, ignoring head gaze. The fMRI results revealed a specific region in the posterior STS, termed the 'gaze following (GF) patch', which was activated during the gaze following task but not during the identity-matching task. This GF patch was separate from the face patches known to process facial identity and is suggested to subserve geometric computations necessary for translating the observed head gaze into shifts of attention. The findings provide insights into the neural mechanisms underlying social attention and suggest potential homologies with human gaze following networks. Additionally, the study identified hemispheric specialization in the STS for gaze following-related activity, which may have implications for understanding the neural basis of social cognition in both monkeys and humans.
elife-02798-v1	[L] This study investigates how visual recovery can be improved in mice that have experienced long-term monocular deprivation, which leads to a loss of visual acuity similar to amblyopia in humans. The researchers found that when mice were allowed to run on a spherical treadmill while being exposed to visual stimuli, their visual responses improved significantly compared to those that only ran or were only exposed to stimuli. This recovery was specific to the visual stimuli presented during running, suggesting that the combination of physical activity and visual experience is crucial for enhancing visual recovery.  [E] The research paper presents a study on the effects of locomotion and visual stimulation on the recovery of visual functions in mice following long-term monocular deprivation (MD). The study utilized intrinsic signal imaging and single-unit recordings to demonstrate that visual responses in mice recover more effectively when they undergo visual stimulation while engaged in physical activity (locomotion). The recovery was stimulus-specific, with enhanced responses observed for the particular visual stimuli presented during locomotion. This suggests that the neural circuits activated during running contribute to the improved recovery of visual functions, which could have implications for developing therapeutic strategies for amblyopia in humans.
elife-61816-v2	[L] The paper discusses the mutualistic relationship between leaf-cutting ants and their fungal cultivars, which together form a complex symbiosis. The ants harvest leaves, which are used as a growth substrate for the fungi in their nests. This process involves the ants chewing the leaves into smaller pieces and mixing them with fecal fluid, which contains enzymes produced by the fungi to help break down the plant material. The study investigates the molecular mechanisms behind this symbiosis, finding that the ants and fungi work together to produce hydroxyl radicals through Fenton chemistry, which helps break down the tough cell walls of the plant material. This allows the fungi to access the nutritious parts of the plant cells more easily. The ants control the Fenton reaction by building pellets of chewed leaf material and only adding fecal fluid when atmospheric oxygen is available, preventing any harmful side effects. The findings provide new insights into how these ants can become crop pests and how their symbiotic partnership has evolved over millions of years.  [E] The research paper delves into the intricate mutualistic symbiosis between attine fungus-growing ants, specifically the leaf-cutting ants from the genera Acromyrmex and Atta, and their fungal cultivar partners, Leucocoprinus gongylophorus. The authors explore the physiological complementarity that underpins this symbiosis, focusing on the ants' ability to process plant material for the fungi and the fungi's role in breaking down this material. The study builds on previous research that identified enzymes in the ants' fecal fluid that aid in plant degradation and presents new findings on the potential role of Fenton chemistry in this process. The authors hypothesize that the ants and fungi have co-evolved to use hydroxyl radicals, produced through Fenton reactions, to efficiently break down the lignocellulose in plant material. They provide evidence supporting this hypothesis through proteomic analysis of the ants' fecal fluid and experimental validation of the presence of key compounds and reactions involved in Fenton chemistry. The paper also discusses the ants' behavioral adaptations that control the Fenton reaction and protect both the ants and fungi from potential damage caused by the highly reactive hydroxyl radicals. The findings enhance our understanding of the evolution and function of complex symbiotic relationships and have implications for agriculture, as these ants are known crop pests.
elife-10115-v2	[L] The research paper discusses the role of the Greatwall (GWL) kinase in cell transformation and cancer development. The study shows that overexpression of GWL can lead to increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in various cell lines. It also suggests that GWL overexpression promotes the aggressive behavior of cancer cells by increasing the activity of AKT, a protein involved in cell growth and survival, through the degradation of a phosphatase called PHLPP. The paper also reveals that GWL is frequently overexpressed in various transformed cell lines and tumor tissues, indicating its potential as a marker for oncogenic transformation. The findings of this study could have significant implications for cancer diagnosis and treatment.  [E] The study investigated the role of Greatwall (GWL) kinase, originally implicated in the regulation of mitotic progression, in the context of cell transformation and cancer development. The researchers demonstrated that overexpression of GWL, particularly in human breast and colon cancer cell lines, leads to increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Mechanistically, this was found to be associated with enhanced AKT phosphorylation at the S473 residue, a known marker of AKT activation. Importantly, this effect was shown to be independent of the canonical ARPP19/ENSA-PP2AB55 pathway, which is typically regulated by GWL. Instead, the study suggests a novel mechanism involving the degradation of PHLPP, a phosphatase responsible for AKT dephosphorylation at S473. Consistent with a role in oncogenesis, high GWL expression was observed in a variety of transformed cell lines and was positively correlated with tumor progression in colorectal cancer samples. The findings provide new insights into the oncogenic potential of GWL and implicate it as a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment.
elife-55692-v1	[L] This paper investigates the effects of a new antibiotic called bedaquiline (BDQ) used to treat tuberculosis (TB) on human immune cells called macrophages. The study found that BDQ not only kills bacteria but also reprograms the macrophages to increase their ability to kill bacteria and control infections. The researchers discovered that BDQ activates a protein called TFEB, which is important for the production of lysosomes, small compartments in the cell that help break down and recycle waste materials. This activation leads to an increase in the number of lysosomes and their ability to destroy bacteria. The study also found that BDQ can boost the activity of other TB drugs and may be used in combination treatments in the future.  [E] This study explores the impact of the anti-tuberculosis drug bedaquiline (BDQ) on the transcriptional responses of human macrophages infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). The findings reveal that BDQ induces a significant metabolic reprogramming of macrophages, leading to increased lysosomal biogenesis and acidification. BDQ treatment activates the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor EB (TFEB), which is a master regulator of autophagy and lysosome biogenesis. This activation enhances the macrophages' ability to control bacterial infections and increases the efficacy of other anti-TB drugs. The results suggest that BDQ may have potential as a host-directed therapy (HDT) agent, which could be used in conjunction with existing or future antibiotics to improve treatment outcomes for TB patients.
elife-21130-v1	[L] The paper discusses the role of a protein called YAP in the development of the lungs. The researchers found that YAP is active throughout the lung epithelium, which is the tissue that lines the lungs, and is involved in the formation of the complex branched structure of the lungs. They also discovered that when YAP is removed, the lungs form cysts instead of properly formed tissue, indicating that YAP is crucial for normal lung development. The study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms that control lung growth and patterning, and could have implications for understanding lung diseases.  [E] The study investigates the role of the Hippo signaling pathway, specifically the transcriptional coactivator YAP, in lung morphogenesis. The authors demonstrate that YAP is active throughout the lung epithelium during development and that its loss leads to the formation of cysts and disrupted lung branching. The findings support a model in which YAP controls lung growth and patterning by regulating epithelial cell properties such as cell proliferation and mechanical force production. The study also identifies new YAP target genes involved in these processes, revealing a complex signaling network that mediates YAP activity in the lung. The results provide a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying lung development and may have implications for the development of lung diseases.
elife-00792-v1	[L] The paper discusses the complex structure of the type III secretion apparatus, known as the injectisome, in Gram-negative bacteria. The injectisome allows bacteria to export proteins across bacterial membranes and into eukaryotic cells. The study reveals the injectisome's three main parts and its flexibility, which helps it adapt to changes in the bacterial environment. The authors also provide a detailed model of the injectisome's structure, contributing to our understanding of bacterial mechanisms and potential targets for antibiotic development.  [E] The research article presents a comprehensive investigation into the structure and function of the bacterial type III secretion apparatus, or injectisome, which facilitates the translocation of effector proteins across dual membranes in Gram-negative bacteria. The study employs cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET), X-ray crystallography, and molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the architecture and mechanical properties of the injectisome. Notably, the authors document the basal body's adaptability to variations in the intermembrane distance, which is attributed to the elasticity of specific protein components. The findings advance our understanding of bacterial pathogenesis and may inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies by providing potential targets for antibiotic intervention.
elife-06587-v1	[L] The Arabidopsis FERONIA (FER) receptor kinase is a critical component for plant growth, development, and defense responses. It plays a crucial role in female fertility and reproduction, as well as in regulating various plant hormone signaling pathways. The paper investigates the interaction between FER and two glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (GPI-APs), LORELEI (LRE) and LRE-like GPI-APs 1, 2, 3 (LLG1, 2, 3), which are involved in various developmental processes. The study shows that LRE and LLG1 physically interact with FER and are essential for its cell surface signaling capacity. The results suggest that partnering with related but differentially expressed proteins is a strategy for FER to execute its diverse biological roles and provide a novel mechanism for how GPI-APs might control cell surface signaling.

elife-00078-v1	[L] The research paper discusses the study of archaeal nucleosome core particles, which protect DNA in archaea, and compares them to eukaryotic nucleosomes. The study demonstrates that the architecture of archaeal chromatin and the occupancy of its nucleosomes along transcription units are conserved. The researchers constructed a nucleosome occupancy map of the halophilic archaeon Haloferax volcanii and found that it has a higher nucleosome density than all eukaryotes. The study also investigated the relationship between nucleosome occupancy and gene expression, finding that nucleosome-depleted regions at the transcriptional start and termination sites are conserved in Hfx. volcanii, suggesting that the interplay between chromatin and transcription is conserved in archaeal promoters. The findings suggest that both histones and chromatin architecture arose before the divergence of Archaea and Eukarya, indicating that the fundamental role of chromatin in the regulation of gene expression is ancient.  [E] The study provides a comprehensive analysis of the nucleosome occupancy pattern in the archaeon Haloferax volcanii and compares it to that of eukaryotes. The researchers used micrococcal nuclease digestion to produce nucleosomal fragments from crosslinked Hfx. volcanii chromatin and generated a genome-wide nucleosome occupancy map. The map revealed a periodic pattern of nucleosome occupancy, with protected regions appearing as peaks and linker regions as troughs. The study also found that nucleosome midpoints were enriched with G/C nucleotides and depleted of A/T nucleotides, which is similar to observations made in human cell lines. Additionally, the researchers investigated the relationship between nucleosome occupancy and gene expression and found that the nucleosome-depleted regions at the transcriptional start and termination sites are conserved in Hfx. volcanii. The findings suggest that the basic mechanisms of chromatin architecture and gene regulation are conserved between archaea and eukarya and that chromatin architecture arose early in evolutionary history.
elife-16843-v1	[L] This paper investigates the role of serotonin signaling in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, in modulating behavior and lifespan in response to dietary protein. The researchers found that serotonin signaling through a specific receptor, 5HT2a, is required for flies to prefer a protein-rich diet after mild starvation. They also identified an amino acid transporter, JhI-21, as a potential upstream regulator of serotonin signaling in the context of protein valuation. Interestingly, when flies were given a choice between different nutrient sources, those with reduced serotonin signaling lived significantly longer, suggesting that the brain's evaluation of nutrient demand and reward can influence aging independently of food consumption.  [E] This study examines the impact of serotonergic signaling on protein preference and lifespan in Drosophila melanogaster. The findings reveal that serotonin, through the 5HT2a receptor, mediates protein-seeking behavior in response to starvation and is necessary for the flies to exhibit a preference for protein. Additionally, the study identifies JhI-21, an amino acid transporter, as a potential upstream modulator of serotonin signaling in protein valuation. In a choice diet environment, flies with disruptions in serotonin signaling or JhI-21 exhibited extended lifespans, indicating that the central evaluation of nutrient demand and reward by the brain can modulate aging processes independent of overall food intake.
elife-09214-v2	[L] The paper discusses a study on clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), the most common type of kidney cancer. The study found that ccRCC has a relatively low number of genetic mutations, suggesting that epigenetic factors, such as the regulation of gene expression, play a significant role in the development and progression of the disease. The researchers discovered that a high level of transcription read-through, a process where the genetic code is read beyond the intended stop point, is prevalent in ccRCC and is associated with poor survival rates. They identified a specific gene mutation, SETD2 inactivation, as a major driver of this read-through. The study also found that read-through can interfere with the expression of other genes and lead to the formation of RNA chimeras, which could contribute to cancer progression. This research provides new insights into the mechanisms behind ccRCC and could have implications for the development of targeted therapies.  [E] The paper presents a comprehensive analysis of transcriptional profiling in ccRCC, revealing a high prevalence of transcription read-through and its correlation with poor patient survival. The study identifies SETD2 inactivation as a major contributor to impaired transcription termination and increased read-through levels. Additionally, the research uncovers the widespread occurrence of RNA chimeras in ccRCC, which may play a role in cancer progression. These findings highlight the prognostic power of transcription read-through and its role in the diversification of the tumor transcriptome, offering potential targets for therapeutic intervention in ccRCC.
elife-12095-v3	[L] This paper discusses the role of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and its binding protein, glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored high density lipoprotein–binding protein 1 (GPIHBP1) in the processing of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) in the bloodstream. The authors describe how GPIHBP1 transports LPL across endothelial cells to its site of action in the capillary lumen, and how mutations in either protein can lead to severe hypertriglyceridemia. The paper also explores the structure and function of GPIHBP1, highlighting its unique N-terminal acidic domain and its role in binding to LPL. The authors present new findings on the interaction between GPIHBP1 and LPL, showing that the acidic domain is intrinsically disordered and plays a role in stabilizing LPL's catalytic activity. The study provides insights into the physiological importance of the LPL-GPIHBP1 complex in lipid metabolism and suggests potential avenues for future research and therapeutic development.  [E] The study elucidates the molecular interactions between lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and its binding protein, glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored high density lipoprotein–binding protein 1 (GPIHBP1), which are essential for the lipolysis of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) in the bloodstream. By utilizing a combination of hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS), surface plasmon resonance (SPR), zero-length cross-linking, and LPL activity assays, the authors provide a detailed characterization of the LPL-GPIHBP1 complex. They demonstrate that GPIHBP1's N-terminal intrinsically disordered acidic domain plays a crucial role in stabilizing LPL's catalytic activity by inhibiting its inherent instability and unfolding. Additionally, the study reveals a novel two-step binding mechanism between GPIHBP1 and LPL, involving initial electrostatic interactions between the acidic domain and LPL's C-terminal domain, followed by a tighter binding interface between GPIHBP1's LU domain and specific residues in LPL. These findings provide valuable insights into the biochemistry and biophysics of the LPL-GPIHBP1 interaction and its implications for lipid metabolism, as well as potential targets for therapeutic intervention in conditions such as hypertriglyceridemia.
elife-49375-v2	[L] This paper investigates how a protein called TraR regulates gene expression in bacteria. It explains that TraR interacts with another protein, RNA polymerase (RNAP), which is responsible for transcribing genes into messenger RNA. The study uses a technique called cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to visualize the changes in the structure of RNAP when TraR binds to it. The results show that TraR causes conformational changes in RNAP, which can either activate or inhibit transcription from specific genes. The paper proposes a model for how TraR accelerates multiple steps in the formation of a transcription initiation complex and modulates the stability of intermediates in the process. Overall, the findings provide insights into the regulation of gene expression in bacteria and the role of TraR in this process.  [E] The study examines the molecular mechanism of transcription initiation regulation by the TraR protein in Escherichia coli. It reveals that TraR binding to RNA polymerase (RNAP) induces conformational changes that can either activate or inhibit transcription from specific promoters. Cryo-EM structures of RNAP in complex with TraR and a promoter DNA reveal the basis for these regulatory effects. The study proposes a model in which TraR accelerates multiple steps along the open promoter complex (RPo) formation pathway and modulates the stability of intermediates in the process. The findings provide a detailed understanding of how TraR regulates transcription initiation in bacteria and contribute to the broader knowledge of gene expression regulation in prokaryotes.
elife-11190-v1	[L] The research paper discusses how the hormone ghrelin affects feeding behavior in animals, particularly in anticipation of meals. Ghrelin, often referred to as the 'hunger hormone', is released by the stomach and prepares the body for food intake. The study focuses on the role of ghrelin on the brain's response to meal-related cues and how this influences feeding habits. The researchers found that blocking ghrelin receptors in certain parts of the brain could reduce food intake in rats that were conditioned to eat at specific times. The findings provide insights into the neural mechanisms that control eating behavior and could potentially lead to new strategies for managing obesity.  [E] The study investigates the neural pathways through which ghrelin, a hormone associated with meal anticipation and increased food intake, communicates with the central nervous system to regulate feeding behavior. Utilizing a combination of neural pathway tracing, immunohistochemistry, behavioral neuropharmacology, meal entrainment conditioning, and neural 'disconnection' methods, the research establishes a pathway where peripherally-derived ghrelin activates growth hormone secretagogue receptor 1A (GHSR) expressing neurons in the ventral/temporal subregions of the hippocampus (vHP), which in turn activate orexin-expressing neurons in the dorsal perifornical lateral hypothalamic area (dpLHA), stimulating appetite and feeding behavior via central orexin receptor 1 (Ox1R) signaling. The findings elucidate novel mechanisms linking mnemonic processes with gut-brain communication to control feeding behavior and suggest potential therapeutic targets for feeding disorders.
elife-34848-v1	[L] The paper discusses the rise in dengue cases in the Asia-Pacific region and the challenges in understanding the dynamics of infection and evaluating the impact of vector control measures. The authors investigate the 2013/14 dengue outbreak in Fiji using surveillance data and a population-representative serological survey. They find that the highest infection rate was in the 10-19 year old age group and that spatial structure may be less important in driving transmission dynamics than previously thought. The paper also explores the relationship between reported cases and true attack rates, as well as the relative role of climate, herd immunity, and control measures in shaping transmission. The authors use mathematical models to show that an additional decline in transmission in March 2014, coinciding with a nationwide vector clean-up campaign, could better capture the observed patterns in serological and surveillance data.  [E] The paper examines the dynamics of a major 2013/14 dengue outbreak in Fiji and aims to understand the relationship between observed reported cases and the true attack rate. The authors use surveillance data and a population-representative serological survey to investigate the relative role of climate, herd immunity, and control measures in shaping transmission. They find that the highest infection rate was in the 10-19 year old age group and that there is little evidence of spatial heterogeneity in seroconversion. The paper also explores the relationship between reported cases and infections estimated from the serological survey, as well as the potential effectiveness of control measures. Mathematical models are used to show that an additional decline in transmission in March 2014, coinciding with a nationwide vector clean-up campaign, could better capture the observed patterns in serological and surveillance data. The findings have implications for forecasting future epidemics and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures.
elife-53227-v2	[L] The paper discusses the trypanothione system in trypanosomatids, a group of parasitic protozoa that cause various diseases in humans and animals. The authors focus on the role of tryparedoxin (Tpx) and trypanothione (T(SH)2) in the parasites' response to oxidative stress. They use a novel biosensor, Tpx-roGFP2, to monitor changes in the redox state of T(SH)2 in real-time within the cytosol and mitochondria of African trypanosomes. The study reveals that both compartments have a trypanothione-based redox metabolism, with the mitochondrial matrix being slightly less reducing than the cytosol. The authors also show that inhibition of T(SH)2 biosynthesis by the drug DFMO impairs the parasites' ability to cope with oxidative stress, indicating a direct link between the trypanothione systems of the two compartments.  [E] This study investigates the trypanothione (T(SH)2) system in trypanosomatids, which are parasites responsible for various diseases such as African sleeping sickness and Chagas' disease. The authors examine the role of tryparedoxin (Tpx) and T(SH)2 in the response of these parasites to oxidative stress, using a newly developed biosensor, Tpx-roGFP2. The research demonstrates that both the cytosol and mitochondria of African trypanosomes contain a trypanothione-based redox metabolism, with the mitochondrial matrix having a slightly lower reducing capacity than the cytosol. The study also shows that inhibition of T(SH)2 biosynthesis by the drug DFMO affects the parasites' ability to handle oxidative stress, suggesting a direct connection between the trypanothione systems in both compartments. These findings provide valuable insights into the redox metabolism of trypanosomatids and may have implications for the development of new therapeutic strategies against these parasites.
