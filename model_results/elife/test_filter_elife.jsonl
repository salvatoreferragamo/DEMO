The cellular Potts model ( CPM , Box 1 ) is a well-established framework for simulating interacting cells . Originally proposed as a model for cell sorting ( Graner and Glazier , 1992 ) , the CPM has since been extended with a plethora of biological processes such as proliferation , apoptosis , cell motion , and chemotaxis – allowing CPM users to model diverse phenomena ranging from slime mould formation to blood vessel development , tumour growth , and cell migration ( Marée et al . , 2007; Szabó and Merks , 2013; Hirashima et al . , 2017 ) . Nowadays , several mature modelling frameworks with CPM implementations exist , such as CompuCell3D ( Swat et al . , 2012 ) , Morpheus ( Starruß et al . , 2014 ) , Tissue Simulation Toolkit ( Daub and Merks , 2015 ) , and CHASTE ( Mirams et al . , 2013 ) . Although CPMs are relatively efficient models , tissue-scale simulations still require substantial computational resources . For this reason , all of the abovementioned frameworks rely on the C++ programming language for computation steps , which requires them to be built for and installed on the user’s native operating system . Here , we present ‘Artistoo’ ( Artificial Tissue Toolbox ) , a CPM framework built entirely in JavaScript . Although interpreted languages like JavaScript have classically been deemed too inefficient for running simulations , we found that this no longer holds: investments by major tech companies have tremendously improved JavaScript engines over the past years , to the point that our CPM now has no major performance disadvantage compared to existing C++ frameworks . The JavaScript implementation of Artistoo opens up new possibilities for rapid and low-barrier sharing of CPM simulations with students , collaborators , and readers or reviewers of a paper . Unlike existing frameworks , Artistoo allows building simulations that run in the web browser without the need to install any software: Artistoo models run on any platform providing a standards-compliant web browser – be it a desktop computer , a tablet , or a mobile phone . These simulations can be published on any web server or saved locally and do not rely on any back-end servers being available . They can be made explorable , enabling viewers to interact with the simulation and see the effect of changing model parameters in real time . In this paper , we will first briefly explain the key design principles behind Artistoo . We will then highlight applications in teaching , research , science dissemination , and open science where we envision that the zero-install , web-based architecture of our framework could be particularly useful . 2 Results Artistoo is a JavaScript library implemented as an ECMAScript 6 module , which can be loaded into an HTML page or accessed from within a Node . js command line application . Artistoo is an open-source library released under the MIT license and is freely available on GitHub at https://github . com/ingewortel/artistoo ( copy archived at swh:1:rev:551ee76c3a972e86ac72ed7e977356a75d091763; Wortel and Textor , 2020 ) . We here highlight a number of settings where Artistoo might complement other available modelling frameworks , focusing on the unique feature of Artistoo: it allows users to build and share explorable simulations in a zero-install setting . We discuss how this opens up novel opportunities of sharing CPM-based research and provide examples from our own work . 3 Discussion The recent rise of the open science movement has changed the way research outputs are being shared and communicated . This may be especially important for computational models , which have classically been difficult to share because of the required software and coding skills . Transparent model sharing calls for new strategies to make models accessible for broader audiences . Indeed , several such efforts have been made in recent years . The CPM framework CompuCell3D now hosts an online version on NanoHub , which users can access without installing software locally ( Gianlupi and Sego , 2021 ) . Beyond the CPM field , modelling frameworks like Tellurium ( Choi et al . , 2018 ) and PhysiCell ( Ghaffarizadeh et al . , 2018 ) have also created online access through NanoHub; these frameworks have also shown how such online models can be made interactive by using ( variations of ) Jupyter notebooks ( see , e . g . , Macklin and Heiland , 2020; Medley et al . , 2018; Somogyi , 2019 ) . The potential of explorable online web pages in communication and teaching is also demonstrated by the emerging practice to share R models in the form of Shiny apps ( Schönbrodt , 2014; Zehetleitner and Schönbrodt , 2015; Granjon , 2019 ) . And finally , the online collection of ‘complexity explorables’ ( Brockmann , 2020 ) is a fantastic example of how to combine interactive online simulations with explanatory text to communicate modelling research . With Artistoo , we now hope to open up this powerful avenue of model sharing for CPM research , allowing users to build online web pages and ‘explorables’ that combine interactive simulations with model explanations . We here show that the framework’s performance ( similar to that of existing frameworks in C++ ) is sufficient to allow for interactive CPM simulations . We have been developing the library for more than 5 years , also using it for robust simulation work in our research; see , for example , Wortel et al . , 2020 . We are continuing to develop the library for our own work and welcome suggestions and code contributions from the community . We do not envision Artistoo to replace existing modelling software; rather , it can complement software directed at computational biologists and developers by letting users build explorable and sharable versions of a simulation . To facilitate this process , we have built a ( prototype ) tool to help users convert models between different frameworks ( currently: Artistoo and Morpheus ) . Although Artistoo already offers a wide range of methods , it does not ( yet ) support all features of existing frameworks ( Morpheus , CHASTE , CompuCell3D , Tissue Simulation Toolkit ) , such as solvers for reaction–diffusion equations or SBML-encoded intracellular signalling , or writing output in formats like VTK and HDF5 . Nevertheless , Artistoo simulations are highly customisable , and a wide range of CPM models can already be constructed using the framework in its current state . The software’s modular structure also makes it easy for future developers to extend it with custom code . In summary , to the best of our knowledge , Artistoo is the first CPM simulation framework supporting interactive simulations in the web browser that can be shared via a simple URL , without requiring installed software or back-end servers . We hope that this will unlock avenues of sharing and communicating ( CPM ) simulations to much larger audiences . 4 Materials and methods To compare performance of Artistoo versus that of Morpheus ( v2 . 1 . 0 ) , we performed four different simulations in both frameworks . For this , we used the default examples provided with Morpheus and rebuilt similar simulations in Artistoo . This model of a migrating cell implements an actin-inspired migration model ( Niculescu et al . , 2015 ) ( see also Interactive Simulation 4 in Appendix 1 ) . A single cell was seeded in the middle of a 200 × 200 pixel grid . Two obstacles of radius 10 were placed at a distance of 50 pixels to the left and right of the cell , respectively . Simulations were run for 15 , 000 MCS , logging the cell’s centroid every 10 MCS and saving a PNG every 250 MCS . This simulation is the Morpheus example CPM/Protrusion_2D . xml ( version 4 ) . This simulation implements the classical CPM model published by Graner and Glazier , 1992 ( see also Interactive Simulation 5 in Appendix 1 ) . Fifty cells each of two cell types were seeded on a 200 × 200 pixel grid within a circle of radius 67 from the grid midpoint . Simulations were run for 2000 MCS , logging statistics every 10 MCS and saving a PNG every 100 MCS . This simulation is the Morpheus example CPM/CellSorting_2D . xml ( version 4 ) , where the StopTime field was changed from 2 . 5e4 to 2000 . A CPM linked to cell division ( see also Interactive Simulation 6 in Appendix 1 ) was simulated on a 500 × 500 pixel grid . The grid was initialised with 20 cells in a circle of radius 35 surrounding the grid midpoint . Simulations were run for 40 , 000 MCS , logging the number of cells every 100 MCS and saving a PNG every 1000 MCS . This simulation is the Morpheus example CPM/Proliferation_2D . xml ( version 4 ) . For the scalability simulations , simulations were run without outputting images . This allowed us to investigate the simulation speed separately from the time it takes to draw the entire grid . Note that if the drawing step becomes a limiting factor for running the simulation , it is always possible to speed up the process by drawing only once every few steps , or by choosing a more efficient drawing method ( e . g . drawing only cell borders rather than entire cells ) . Simulations contained 1 , 5 , 10 , 50 , 100 , 500 , or 1000 cells per cell type . The grid dimensions were adaptively scaled such that x=y=1 . 5⁢Ptot , with Ptot the total number of pixels of all the cells . Cells were seeded within a radius 0 . 8⁢Ptot/π from the grid midpoint . Other settings were the same as in the cell sorting simulation described under Framework comparisons ."}

Learning more about the processes that lead to kidney inflammation in older people might lead to better ways to prevent or treat their kidney disease . Immune cells called macrophages help protect the body from injury and disease . They do this by triggering inflammation , which aides healing .

Studying these immune cells in the kidney and how they change over the lifespan could help scientists to better understand age-related kidney disease . Now , Ide , Yahara et al . show that one type of macrophage is better at multiplying in older kidneys . In the experiments , mice were genetically engineered to make a fluorescent red protein in one kind of macrophage . This allowed Ide , Yahara et al . to track these immune cells as the mice aged . The experiments showed that this subgroup of cells is first produced when the mice are embryos . They stay in the mouse kidneys into adulthood , and are so prolific that , over time , they eventually become the most common macrophage in older kidneys .

More studies will help scientists to understand how these particular cells contribute to age-related changes in susceptibility to kidney disease .", "article": "1 Introduction Tissue-resident macrophages constitute a highly heterogeneous and specialized population of myeloid cells , reflecting the diversity of their developmental origins and tissue microenvironments ( Mass , 2018; Ginhoux et al . , 2010; Schulz et al . , 2012; Yona et al . , 2013; Gomez Perdiguero et al . , 2015; Mass et al . , 2016; Hashimoto et al . , 2013; Epelman et al . , 2014; Stremmel et al . , 2018; Hoeffel et al . , 2015 ) . In addition to their critical roles in host defense against pathogens , macrophages are central to sterile inflammation , angiogenesis , and tissue remodeling , making them an attractive target for therapeutic intervention . Tissue-resident macrophages originate from at least three distinct progenitors: ( i ) macrophage colony-stimulating factor one receptor ( CSF1R ) -positive yolk-sac macrophages; ( ii ) CX3C chemokine receptor 1 ( CX3CR1 ) -positive yolk-sac macrophages , also known as pre-macrophages; and ( iii ) embryonic and neonatal hematopoietic stem cells ( HSC ) ( Mass , 2018; Ginhoux et al . , 2010; Schulz et al . , 2012; Yona et al . , 2013; Gomez Perdiguero et al . , 2015; Mass et al . , 2016; Hashimoto et al . , 2013; Epelman et al . , 2014; Stremmel et al . , 2018 ) . These populations are maintained in situ by self-renewal , largely independent of adult hematopoiesis ( Mass , 2018; Ginhoux et al . , 2010; Schulz et al . , 2012; Yona et al . , 2013; Gomez Perdiguero et al . , 2015; Mass et al . , 2016; Hashimoto et al . , 2013; Epelman et al . , 2014; Hoeffel et al . , 2015; Sawai et al . , 2016; Soucie et al . , 2016 ) . Most tissues have mixed populations of different ontogenically-derived macrophages , and their relative contributions and temporal kinetics are tissue-specific . For example , microglia , Kupffer cells , and Langerhans cells originate from the yolk-sac , with minimal contribution from HSCs ( Ginhoux et al . , 2010; Schulz et al . , 2012; Yona et al . , 2013; Gomez Perdiguero et al . , 2015; Mass et al . , 2016; Sawai et al . , 2016 ) . The macrophage composition in the intestinal wall is highly dynamic . Yolk-sac-derived intestinal macrophages are rapidly replaced by HSC-derived macrophages after birth , but a subpopulation of yolk-sac-derived cells persist and self-renew in the specialized intestinal niches in adults ( Bain et al . , 2014; De Schepper et al . , 2018 ) . Importantly , investigators now recognize that macrophage ontogeny contributes to their roles in disease processes such as cancer progression; in pancreatic cancer , for example , yolk-sac-derived macrophages are fibrogenic , while HSC-derived macrophages are immunogenic ( Zhu et al . , 2017 ) . This raises the possibility that developmental programs influence how macrophages differentially respond to disease insults . Renal macrophages are found in an intricate network surrounding the renal tubular epithelium ( Stamatiades et al . , 2016; Berry et al . , 2017; Viehmann et al . , 2018 ) and have mixed origins from both yolk-sac and HSC ( Schulz et al . , 2012; Mass et al . , 2016; Epelman et al . , 2014; Munro et al . , 2019 ) . They exert unique functions depending on their anatomical locations; monitoring and clearing immune complexes is a function of cortical macrophages while bacterial immunity is the responsibility of medullary macrophages ( Stamatiades et al . , 2016; Berry et al . , 2017 ) . Renal macrophages critically control renal inflammation and tissue remodeling after injury with robust phenotypic reprogramming ( Lever et al . , 2019 ) . Despite the importance of these roles , little is known about how the proportion and distribution of macrophages of different ontogeny change over time in the normal kidney and whether this influences the increased susceptibility and poorer outcomes of older patients to acute and chronic kidney diseases ( Chen et al . , 2019; Chawla et al . , 2014; Sato and Yanagita , 2019 ) . While most preclinical models of kidney diseases have used young animals , recent papers highlight distinct immune responses in aged mouse kidneys . Aged kidneys exhibit more severe inflammation than young kidneys in response to ischemic and toxic insults , leading to maladaptive repair and organ dysfunction ( Sato and Yanagita , 2019; Sato et al . , 2016 ) . Furthermore , there is a growing interest in aging as a fundamental determinant of macrophage heterogeneity , such as in the heart and serous cavities ( Molawi et al . , 2014; Bain et al . , 2016; Dick et al . , 2019 ) . However , data on the effects of aging on the renal macrophage populations are lacking . Here , using complementary in vivo genetic fate-mapping and parabiotic approaches , we identify a previously unappreciated increase in the proportion of yolk-sac-derived macrophages in the mouse kidney with age . 2 Results and discussion Two complementary strategies were used to fate-map CSF1R+ , and CX3CR1+ yolk-sac-derived macrophages ( Figure 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . Erythromyeloid progenitors ( EMP ) give rise to these populations , and the yolk-sac macrophages appear in the yolk-sac around E8 . 5 . Subsequently , from E9 . 0 until E14 . 5 , they proliferate , migrate , and colonize the embryo through the vascular system ( Stremmel et al . , 2018; Munro et al . , 2019 ) . To lineage-label these cells , we exposed Csf1r-CreERt; Rosa26tdTomato and Cx3cr1CreERt; Rosa26tdTomato embryos to 4-hydroxytamoxifen ( 4-OHT ) at E8 . 5 and E9 . 5 , respectively ( Figure 1A and Figure 1—figure supplement 1A ) , ( Mass , 2018 ) . This efficiently and irreversibly labels yolk-sac-derived macrophages with the tdTomato reporter . Importantly , the approach does not label fetal monocytes or HSCs ( Gomez Perdiguero et al . , 2015; Yahara et al . , 2020 ) . At postnatal day 0 ( P0 ) , we detected a small number of tdTomato+ cells in kidneys from both lines ( Figure 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . A previous fate-mapping strategy that labels all HSC-derived cells indicated that 40% to 50% of tissue-resident macrophages in the young adult kidney originate from HSC; the remainder was inferred to derive from yolk-sac hematopoiesis ( Schulz et al . , 2012 ) . Consistent with this inference , we found CX3CR1-lineage labeled cells in kidneys from birth , with numbers increasing progressively over time ( 2 weeks , 2 months and 6 months; Figure 1 , B and C ) . Surprisingly , we observed an unexpected large increase in the proportion of tdTomato-positive cells relative to total F4/80-positive cells at 6 months , especially in the cortex and outer medulla , despite no significant change in the number of F4/80-positive cells per section . This increase was maintained up to 1 year ( Figure 1B ) . The tdTomato-labeled cells were positive for mature macrophage markers , F4/80 and CD64 ( Figure 1D ) , ( Viehmann et al . , 2018; Brähler et al . , 2018 ) . By contrast , we observed only a few F4/80-positive CSF1R-lineage cells inside the kidneys ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 , B and C ) , as reported previously ( Schulz et al . , 2012 ) . As CSF1R+ and CX3CR1+ yolk-sac macrophages represent a developmental sequence of tissue-resident macrophages derived from EMP , the observed low labeling of CSF1R-lineage cells might be attributable to differences in labeling efficacies and migration kinetics of progenitors . To further delineate the chronological shift of renal macrophages , we examined the HSC contribution to renal macrophages using the Flt3-Cre; Rosa26tdTomato mouse line ( Mass , 2018; Yahara et al . , 2020; Benz et al . , 2008 ) . This mouse line irreversibly labels fetal and adult HSC-derived multipotent hematopoietic progenitors and their progeny with tdTomato expression . Consistent with the increase of yolk-sac-derived renal macrophages with age , we observed a decreased number of F4/80+ tdTomato+ cells in the kidneys from 6-month-old mice compared to those from 2-month-old mice ( Figure 2 , A and B ) . These data demonstrate that EMP-derived CX3CR1+ yolk-sac macrophages and their descendants are major contributors to the resident renal macrophage population in aged kidneys . Our findings raise the question of the underlying mechanisms responsible for the chronological shift of macrophage composition . We first tested whether the proliferation of yolk-sac-derived renal macrophages can potentially contribute to their population dynamics . CX3CR1-lineage-labeled cells that express the proliferation marker , Ki67 , are present in kidneys from birth to 6 months of age , indicating that yolk-sac-derived macrophages retain the potential to expand in numbers through proliferation ( Figure 3 , A and B ) . We further found that higher percentages of CX3CR1-lineage-labeled F4/80+ cells express Ki67 in comparison to tdTomato-negative F4/80+ cells at 2 weeks and 2 months of age , suggesting that CX3CR1-lineage cells have a higher proliferating capacity ( Figure 3C ) . Another possibility is recruitment of yolk-sac-derived macrophages from extra-renal reservoirs through the circulation . To test this hypothesis , we generated a parabiotic union between young Cx3cr1GFP/+ and Cx3cr1CreERt; Rosa26tdTomato mice that had been exposed to 4-OHT in utero at E9 . 5 ( Figure 4A ) . Effective blood sharing between the pair was confirmed by detecting Cx3cr1-promoter-driven GFP expression in bone marrow cells derived from both mice ( data not shown ) . When analyzed at 5 weeks after parabiosis , we found a few tdTomato+ cells in the extravascular , interstitial area of the cortex and medulla of the Cx3cr1GFP parabiont kidneys ( 0 . 105 ± 0 . 04% of total F4/80+ cells; Figure 4 , B and C ) . We also found that a significantly higher percentage of tdTomato-positive cells expresses Ki67 in the kidneys of Cx3cr1GFP mice compared to the tdTomato-positive cells in the kidneys of Cx3cr1CreERt; Rosa26tdTomato mice ( Ki67+tdTomato+ relative to tdTomato+; 28 . 55 ± 8 . 23% vs . 3 . 16 ± 0 . 74% ) ( Figure 4 , D and E ) . While further investigation is required , these results suggest that the tdTomato-positive circulating progenitors may have a significant proliferative capacity and can slowly contribute to the adult renal macrophage pool . Currently , the origin of the circulating CX3CR1-lineage cells is not known but we speculate that one site is the spleen , which we recently identified as a reservoir of CX3CR1+ yolk-sac macrophages ( Yahara et al . , 2020 ) . In conclusion , we have shown here that the proportion of yolk-sac-derived , CX3CR1-positive , macrophages increases significantly in the kidney with age , with recruitment from the circulation and proliferation being two possible mechanisms . Our findings provide a foundation for future studies to investigate the functional heterogeneity of ontogenically distinct renal macrophages in younger versus aged kidneys . These future studies may provide novel insight into age-related susceptibility of the kidney to acute and chronic diseases . 3 Materials and methods All experiments were performed according to IACUC-approved protocols ( A051-18-02 and A196-16-0 ) . The mouse lines were from the Jackson Laboratory ( Stock No: 019098; 020940; 007914; and 005582 ) . The Flt3-Cre mouse line was kindly provided from Dr . K Lavine ( Washington University , St . Louis , MO ) . 75 μg/g body weight of 4-hydroxytamoxifen ( 4-OHT; Sigma Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) dissolved in corn oil ( Sigma Aldrich ) was intraperitoneally administered into pregnant dams with 37 . 5 μg/g body weight progesterone ( Sigma Aldrich ) to avoid fetal abortions . Mice without 4-OHT treatment were used for the specificity of tdTomato signals ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) . Animals were allocated randomly into experimental groups and analyses . To determine experimental group sizes , data from our previous study were used to estimate the required numbers . Parabiosis surgery was performed as previously described ( Yahara et al . , 2020 ) . Briefly , a longitudinal skin incision was performed from elbow to knee joint to each mouse . The two mice were connected by suture . Parabionts were separated 5 weeks after the surgery . The mice were euthanized , and kidneys and spleen were harvested for analyses . Sham surgery was performed in the same way except for joining two animals . Primary antibodies: F4/80 ( Bio-Rad , Hercules , CA; clone Cl:A3-1 ) , CD64 ( Bio-Rad; clone AT152-9 ) , Endomucin ( Abcam; Cambridge , UK; clone V . 7C7 . 1 ) , Ki67 ( eBioscience , San Diego , CA; clone SolA15 and Thermo , Waltham , MA; clone SP6 ) , and dsRed ( Rockland , Limerick , PA; cat . #600-401-379 ) . Fluorescent-labeled secondary antibodies were used appropriately . 7 μm cryosections were stained using standard protocols . Heat-induced antigen retrieval was performed using pH6 . 0 sodium citrate solution ( eBioscience ) . Images were captured using Axio imager and 780 confocal microscopes ( Zeiss , Oberkochen , Germany ) . More than three randomly selected areas from 3 to 5 kidneys were imaged and quantified using ImageJ . Results are expressed as means ± SD . Unpaired t-test was used for comparing two groups . One-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's correction was used for multiple group comparison . A P-value less than 0 . 05 was considered statistically significant ."}

Other organs in the body achieve this via a system called the lymphatic system . A network of lymphatic vessels extends throughout the body in a pattern similar to that of blood vessels . Waste products from cells , plus bacteria , viruses and excess fluids drain out of the body’s tissues into lymphatic vessels , which transfer them to the bloodstream . Blood vessels then carry the waste products to the kidneys , which filter them out for excretion . Lymphatic vessels are also a highway for circulation of white blood cells , which fight infections , and are therefore an important part of the immune system . Unlike other organs , the brain does not contain lymphatic vessels . So how does it remove waste ? Some of the brain’s waste products enter the fluid that bathes and protects the brain – the cerebrospinal fluid – before being disposed of via the bloodstream . However , recent studies in rodents have also shown the presence of lymphatic vessels inside the outer membrane surrounding the brain , the dura mater . Absinta , Ha et al . now show that the dura mater of people and marmoset monkeys contains lymphatic vessels too . Spotting lymphatic vessels is challenging because they resemble blood vessels , which are much more numerous . In addition , Absinta , Ha et al . found a way to visualize the lymphatic vessels in the dura mater using brain magnetic resonance imaging , and could confirm that lymphatic vessels are present in autopsy tissue using special staining methods . For magnetic resonance imaging , monkeys and human volunteers received an injection of a dye-like substance called gadolinium , which travels via the bloodstream to the brain . In the dura mater , gadolinium leaks out of blood vessels and collects inside lymphatic vessels , which show up as bright white areas on brain scans . To confirm that the white areas were lymphatic vessels , the experiment was repeated using a different dye that does not leak out of blood vessels . As expected , the signals observed in the previous brain scans did not appear . By visualizing the lymphatic system , this technique makes it possible to study how the brain removes waste products and circulates white blood cells , and to examine whether this process is impaired in aging or disease .", "article": "1 Introduction Recent reports ( Aspelund et al . , 2015; Louveau et al . , 2015b ) described the existence of a network of true lymphatic vessels within the mammalian dura mater that runs alongside blood vessels , notably the superior sagittal and transverse sinuses . The dural lymphatic vessels display typical immunohistochemical markers that identify lymphatic vessels elsewhere in the body . They provide an alternate conduit for drainage of immune cells and cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) from the brain , beyond previously described pathways of flow: via arachnoid granulations into the dural venous sinuses , and via the cribriform plate into the ethmoid region ( Weller et al . , 2009 ) . Although early reports , based on injections of India ink into the cisterna magna of the rat , suggested that the dural pathway accounts for only a minority of the drainage ( Kida et al . , 1993 ) , the more recent studies ( Aspelund et al . , 2015; Louveau et al . , 2015b ) , which are based on injections of fluorescent tracers and in vivo microscopy , indicate that the dural system may be substantially more important for drainage of macromolecules and immune cells than previously realized . Whether a similar network of dural lymphatics is present in primates remains unknown . Moreover , noninvasive visualization of the dural lymphatics – a necessary first step to understanding their normal physiology and potential aberrations in neurological diseases – has not been reported . We therefore verified pathologically the existence of a dural lymphatic network in human and nonhuman primates ( common marmoset monkeys ) and evaluated two magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) techniques that might enable its visualization in vivo . First , the T2-weighted fluid-attenuation inversion recovery ( T2-FLAIR ) pulse sequence , which is the clinical standard for detecting lesions within the brain parenchyma , is highly sensitive to the presence of gadolinium-based contrast agents in the CSF ( Mamourian et al . , 2000; Mathews et al . , 1999; Absinta et al . , 2015 ) . Second , ‘black-blood’ imaging sequences , which are typically used for measurement of vascular wall thickness or detection of atherosclerotic plaque , are tuned to darken the contents of blood vessels ( even when they contain a gadolinium-based contrast agent ) , but in the process the images may highlight vessels with other contents and flow properties ( Mandell et al . , 2017 ) . For comparison , we also acquired a postcontrast T1-weighted Magnetization Prepared Rapid Acquisition of Gradient Echoes ( MPRAGE ) MRI sequence , which is widely implemented for structural brain imaging and depicts avid enhancement of dura mater and blood vessels , but which would not be expected to discriminate lymphatic vessels . 2 Results and discussion Cerebral blood vessels have a highly regulated blood-brain barrier , protecting the neuropil from many contents of the circulating blood . Under physiological conditions , the blood-brain barrier prevents gadolinium-based chelates in standard clinical use from passing into the Virchow-Robin perivascular spaces and parenchyma , so that these structures do not enhance on MRI . On the other hand , dural blood vessels lack a blood-meningeal barrier , enabling leakage of circulating fluids and small substances , including gadolinium-based compounds . This explains the thin , though often incomplete , dural enhancement that is seen on conventional T1-weighted MRI scans under physiological conditions ( Figure 1 ) , as well as its abnormal diffuse or localized thickening in a variety of pathological conditions ( Smirniotopoulos et al . , 2007; Antony et al . , 2015 ) . Using high-resolution ( in-plane resolution 270 × 270 μm or finer ) T2-FLAIR and T1-weighted black-blood MRI images , obtained after the intravenous injection of standard FDA-approved contrast material ( gadobutrol ) , we were able to visualize the collection of interstitial gadolinium within dural lymphatic vessels ( maximum apparent diameter ~1 mm ) in 5/5 human healthy volunteers and 3/3 common marmoset monkeys ( Figure 1 ) . Our results suggest that in the dura , similar to many other organs throughout the body , small intravascular molecules extravasate into the interstitium and then , under a hydrostatic pressure gradient , collect into lymphatic capillaries through a loose lymphatic endothelium ( Sharma et al . , 2008 ) . To further test this hypothesis , meningeal lymphatics were also assessed using a second gadolinium-based contrast agent , gadofosveset , a blood-pool contrast agent suitable for angiography ( Lauffer et al . , 1998 ) . Gadofosveset binds reversibly to serum albumin , increasing its molecular weight from 0 . 9 to 67 kDa . Under physiological conditions , albumin has a low transcapillary exchange rate into the interstitial compartment , estimated to be on the order of 5% per hour , which explains the propensity of gadofosveset to remain within blood vessels ( Richardson et al . , 2015 ) . In both species , gadofosveset did not reveal dural lymphatics , especially on T1-black blood images ( Figure 2 and Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) . As expected , on T1-weighted MPRAGE images , gadofosveset provided superior intravascular enhancement , in both meningeal and parenchymal blood vessels , compared to gadobutrol ( Figure 2 ) . On 3D-rendering of subtraction MRI images ( Videos 1–2 , Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) , dural lymphatics are seen running parallel to the dural venous sinuses , especially the superior sagittal and straight sinuses , and alongside branches of the middle meningeal artery . The topography of the meningeal lymphatics fits with the previously described network in rodents as well as our neuropathological data ( Figures 3 and 4 ) . It is worth noting that the lymphatics visualized by MRI are large slow-flow lymphatic ducts , whereas blind-ending and small lymphatic capillaries , clearly seen by histopathology ( Figure 3 and Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) , are unlikely to be revealed by MRI . The induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis ( EAE ) did not affect detection of dural lymphatic vessel in either of the two animals that we tested ( not shown ) . To support our in vivo imaging results , we further investigated the existence and topography of lymphatics in coronal and longitudinal sections of human and marmoset dura mater . To accomplish this , we tested a variety of putative lymphatic endothelial markers and found that selective double immunostaining for D2-40 podoplanin/CD31 and for PROX1/CD31 was the most effective strategy in discriminating lymphatic vs . venous blood vessels in dura samples – a challenging task since lymphatics sprout from transdifferentiation of venous endothelium ( Ny et al . , 2005; Yaniv et al . , 2006; Srinivasan et al . , 2007; Aspelund et al . , 2014; Lowe et al . , 2015 ) and persistently share some endothelial markers . A branched network of lymphatics was clearly seen within the dura mater . On D2-40 podoplanin/CD31 double staining , we identified a total of 93 human dural lymphatics; most were collapsed , explaining the large range of maximum transverse diameters ( range = 7–842 μm , mean = 125 μm , standard deviation = 161 μm ) . The density of dural lymphatics was higher around the venous sinuses than in more lateral areas of the dura , and higher within the meningeal layer than the periosteal layer of the dura . As expected , red blood cells were not seen within lymphatics . In marmosets , direct comparison between in vivo MRI and histopathology was performed ( Absinta et al . , 2014; Guy et al . , 2016; Luciano et al . , 2016 ) . As shown in Figure 4 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1 , the three dural vessels detected on coronal postcontrast T2-FLAIR and on subtraction images colocalize with three clusters of dural cells expressing the full panel of lymphatic endothelial markers ( LYVE-1 , D2-40 podoplanin , PROX1 , COUP-TFII ) and CCL21 , a chemokine implicated in lymphatic transmigration . In the ongoing debate about the precise localization of lymphatics within the meninges ( either completely within the dura or ‘shared’ between the dura and the arachnoid ) ( Kipnis , 2016; Raper et al . , 2016 ) , our pathological data clearly show that at least some lymphatics are contained entirely within the dura ( Figures 3 and 4 ) . On limited evaluation , we were unable to visualize lymphatics within the leptomeninges , but additional dedicated studies , ideally with nonconventional tissue-preparation methods , are warranted to fully explore this possibility . A comprehensive map of the meningeal lymphatic network would have implications for unraveling the ways in which the meningeal lymphatics participate in waste clearance and in immune cell trafficking within the central nervous system ( Louveau et al . , 2015a; Kipnis , 2016; Raper et al . , 2016 ) . In inflammatory pathological conditions , cellular migration toward the dural lymphatics might be profoundly enhanced by specific signaling and lymphatic plasticity ( Alitalo et al . , 2005; Kim et al . , 2012; Stacker et al . , 2014 ) . Noteworthy in this context are clusters of extravascular CD3+ lymphocytes and CD68+ phagocytic meningeal macrophages that we observed in the dura of several multiple sclerosis autopsies ( not shown ) , confirming intense immune cell trafficking and communication . Indeed , without proper normative comparison , we cannot rule out that the extensive presence of small lymphatics observed in multiple sclerosis dura samples is the result of inflammation-mediated lymphoangiogenesis . On the other hand , lymphatic dysfunction might impair waste clearance in neurodegenerative diseases and aging , in line with the recently captured deposition of β-amyloid in human dura in elderly people ( Kovacs et al . , 2016 ) . Differently from experiments implementing injections of tracers within brain structures , here we aimed primarily to image dural lymphatic vessels in human and nonhuman primates , but we could not prove whether dural lymphatic vessels drain immune cells , CSF , or other substances from the brain to deep cervical lymph nodes , nor could we assess any link with the glymphatic system ( Iliff et al . , 2012; Xie et al . , 2013; Iliff et al . , 2013 ) . Such an analysis would probably require injection of specific MRI-detectable tracers and acquisition of MRI time-series ( not thoroughly explored in the current work ) , an important future research direction for the nonhuman primate work . Overall , our data clearly and consistently demonstrate the existence of lymphatic vessels within the dura mater of human and nonhuman primates . Together with recent studies in rodents , our results show that the meningeal lymphatic system is evolutionarily conserved in mammals and confirm , after exactly two centuries , what the Italian anatomist Paolo Mascagni speculated were lymphatic vessels at the surface of human brain ( Mascagni and Bellini , 1816 ) . The ability to image the meningeal lymphatics noninvasively immediately suggests the possibility of studying potential abnormalities in human neurological disorders . 3 Materials and methods We carried out human studies under a protocol ( NCT02504840 ) approved by NIH Institutional Review Board . Informed consent was obtained from all participants . Formalin-fixed human brains were attained at autopsy after obtaining consent from the next of kin . Animal studies were performed under a protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee . We studied five healthy volunteers ( three women , age range 28–53 years ) and obtained scans on a 3-tesla MRI unit ( Skyra , Siemens Healthcare , Erlangen , Germany ) , using the body coil for radiofrequency transmission and a 32-element phased array coil for reception . Prior to injection of gadolinium-based contrast agent , the following high-resolution MRI sequences were collected: We repeated these acquisitions after injection of gadobutrol ( Gadavist , Bayer HealthCare , Whippany , NJ ) in all five participants . In 2 of the participants , we also repeated the entire protocol prior to and following intravenous injection of gadofosveset ( Lauffer et al . , 1998 ) ( Ablavar , Lantheus Medical Imaging , N Billerica , MA ) . Injections followed the manufacturer’s suggested dosing ( 0 . 1 mmol/kg for gadobutrol , 0 . 03 mmol/kg for gadofosveset ) . We studied three healthy adult common marmosets ( Callithrix jacchus ) ( one female , two males , age range 4–11 years ) . After the baseline MRI , experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis ( EAE ) was induced in 2 marmosets with 0 . 2 mg of fresh-frozen human white matter homogenate as previously described ( Gaitán et al . , 2014 ) . Marmosets were placed in a sphinx position within the magnet , and scans were obtained on a 7-tesla MRI unit ( Avance AVIII , Bruker BioSpin , Billerica , MA , USA ) . Data acquisition was performed in transmit-only/receive-only mode using a homemade linear birdcage coil ( 120 mm inner diameter ) as a radiofrequency transmitter and a homemade , 8-channel radio-frequency surface-array receiver coil assembly placed over the head of the animal . Prior to injection of contrast agent , we collected: We performed the same scans following intravenous injection of gadobutrol and gadofosveset , in two different MRI sessions . Injections used single ( 0 . 1 mmol/kg for gadobutrol , 0 . 03 mmol/kg for gadofosveset ) or triple the recommended human dosing ( 0 . 3 mmol/kg for gadobutrol , 0 . 09 mmol/kg for gadofosveset ) . Scanner-generated DICOM images were converted into NIFTI files for postprocessing . Using MIPAV software ( https://mipav . cit . nih . gov ) , precontrast scans were rigidly registered to postcontrast scans , and subtraction images were created for anatomical identification of dural lymphatic vessels . 3D skull-stripped subtraction images were then imported into Osirix software for maximum intensity projection ( MIP ) 3D rendering . The same postprocessing was performed for scans acquired after gadofosveset injection , and a direct comparison between the two gadolinium-based contrast agents was made . Neuropathological evaluation focused on human and marmoset brain dura mater samples . Multiple human dura samples were obtained from 2 formalin-fixed brains ( 60- and 77-year-olds with longstanding progressive multiple sclerosis ) and from a 33-year-old with refractory epilepsy undergoing anterior temporal lobectomy ( Figure 3—source data 1 ) . Primate samples were obtained from 3 adult common marmosets ( 2 with EAE ) [Figure 4—source data 1] . After general anesthesia and transcardial perfusion of 4% paraformaldehyde , marmoset brains were extracted and stored in 10% formalin . For primate brains , MRI-matched histological sections were achieved via 7T MRI of the fixed brain and subsequent gross sectioning with an individualized , MRI-designed , 3D-printed cutting box , as previously described ( Absinta et al . , 2014; Guy et al . , 2016; Luciano et al . , 2016 ) . Coronal and longitudinal 3 to 7 μm paraffin sections of the dura mater were stained with hematoxylin and eosin ( H and E ) . Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent analysis for classical lymphatic endothelial cell markers [lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1 ( LYVE-1 ) , podoplanin ( D2-40 ) , prospero homeobox protein 1 ( PROX1 ) , COUP transcription factor 2 ( COUP-TFII ) and CCL21] , were performed on representative slides . Selective double staining for lymphatic vs . vascular endothelial markers ( D2-40/CD31 and PROX1/CD31 ) were also executed on representative sections and implemented for histological quantification; the maximum diameter was recorded for each lymphatic vessel , and descriptive statistics were computed . We also stained for lymphocytes ( CD3 ) and monocytes/macrophages ( CD68 ) . Five-μm paraffin sections of the human skin were used as positive controls for lymphatic endothelium cell marker assessment ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2 ) . For comparison , 10 paraffin human brain tissue blocks , selected for the presence of nearly intact leptomeningeal architecture , were implemented to assess the presence of lymphatics within the subarachnoid space and cerebral parenchyma . Source , antibody type , and dilution are indicated sequentially as follows: LIVE-1 ( Abcam , UK , rabbit polyclonal , 1:200 ) ; podoplanin D2-40 ( AbD Serotec , Hercules , CA , mouse monoclonal , 1:50 ) ; PROX-1 ( AngioBio , San Diego , CA , rabbit polyclonal , 1:50 ) ; COUP TFII ( R&D Systems , Minneapolis , MN , mouse monoclonal , 1:200 ) ; CCL21 ( Abcam , rabbit polyclonal , 1:200 ) ; CD31 ( Abcam , rabbit polyclonal , 1:50 ) ; CD68 KP1 ( Thermofisher , Waltham , MA , mouse monoclonal , 1:100 ) ; CD3 ( Dako , Santa Clara , CA , rabbit polyclonal , 1:200 ) ; goat anti-mouse Alexafluor 488 IgG ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , 1:250 ) and goat anti-rabbit Alexafluor 594 IgG antibodies ( Invitrogen , 1:250 ) . Immunostaining was performed on 3 to 7 μm-thick consecutive paraffin sections with antibodies to LYVE1 , D2-40 podoplanin , PROX1 , COUP-TFII , CCL21 , CD31 , CD68 , CD3 and visualized with 3 , 3'-diaminobenzidine ( DAB ) . Briefly , after deparaffinization , sections were rinsed in triphosphate-buffered saline ( TBS ) for 10 min each , processed for antigen retrieval , and treated in 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 min . Sections were blocked with a protein-blocking solution for 20 min and incubated with the primary antibodies overnight at 4°C or 1 hr at room temperature , then rinsed and incubated with secondary antibodies for 30 min . The immunoreaction was visualized with DAB . After washing , sections were counterstained with 10% hematoxylin . Stained sections were visualized and digitized ( Axio Observer Z . 1 , Carl Zeiss Microscopy , NY , USA ) . Selective double staining for lymphatic and vascular endothelium markers ( D2-40 podoplanin/CD31 , PROX1/CD31 ) , as well double staining for D2-40 podoplanin/PROX1 , were also executed on representative sections . Double staining was performed using , in sequence , DAB horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) and Vector Blue alkaline phosphatase ( AP ) methods . As negative control , sections of human skin , human dura mater , and marmoset brain were stained without the primary antibodies; no background staining and/or nonspecific binding was noted ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2 ) . After deparaffinization , sections were treated using the same method as described above . Sections were incubated with a cocktail of antibodies to D2-40 podoplanin and CD31 for 2 hr at room temperature , then rinsed and incubated with secondary antibodies with Alexafluor 488 goat anti-mouse ( Invitrogen , dilution 1:250 ) and Alexafluor 594 goat anti rabbit IgG antibodies ( Invitrogen , dilution 1:250 ) , respectively , for 30 min at room temperature . After washing , sections were mounted with DAPI Immuno Mount . Stained sections were visualized and digitized ( Axio Observer Z . 1 , Carl Zeiss Microscopy , NY , USA ) ."}

A recent study suggested that termination of tip branching within the developing kidney involved stochastic exhaustion in response to nephron formation , with such a termination event representing a unifying developmental process evident in many organs . To examine this possibility , we have profiled the impact of nephron formation and maturation on elaboration of the ureteric bud during mouse kidney development . We find a distinct absence of random branch termination events within the kidney or evidence that nephrogenesis impacts the branching program or cell proliferation in either tip or progenitor cell niches . Instead , organogenesis proceeds in a manner indifferent to the development of these structures . Hence , stochastic cessation of branching is not a unifying developmental feature in all branching organs .", "plain language summary": "During development and before birth , many organs develop from branched tubes . Whether forming the airways of the lungs , the collecting ducts of the kidneys or the milk ducts of the breast , there are many similarities between these structures . Given their shared tree-like structures , one possibility is that these tissues all form through the same general process . A key challenge is understanding why branched networks develop and pattern in such a way as to assume their functional roles in the adult organ . A unifying theory , which proposes that certain tips stop growing in a random manner , has been proposed to solve this problem . In this theory , the branched mammary gland structures stop growing when the tips of the structure impinge on neighbouring branches . In the kidney , this cessation has been proposed to occur when nephrons – the structures that filter urine from blood – form near the end of the collecting ducts . By growing kidneys in the laboratory and studying developing kidneys in mice , Short et al . investigated whether nephrons do affect collecting duct growth and branch development . The results of these experiments instead suggest that nephron formation has no effect on duct growth or branching . The nephrons also do not appear to affect how quickly the duct cells grow and divide . Moreover , there is no evidence that the cell proliferation in individual branch tips ceases randomly by any other mechanism . Overall , the experiments Short et al . performed suggest that a unifying theory of branching in developing organs may not hold true , at least not in the way that has been envisioned previously .", "article": "1 Introduction Branching morphogenesis is an integral feature of the development of many organs including the kidneys , lungs and mammary gland . Branching typically begins with the formation of a bud like organ anlage which then proceeds to grow and divide , usually by bifurcation . The resulting network of interconnected epithelial tubules serves to break up the larger tissue masses in which they form , facilitating the exchange of oxygen ( lungs ) and nutrients ( vasculature ) and the transport of waste ( kidneys ) or secretions ( glands ) . In some organs like the kidneys and lungs , the process of branching proceeds as a result of the orchestrated interaction of cells at the tips of the branching epithelium and specialized surrounding mesenchymal cells . In others , like the mammary gland , epithelial growth and arborisation occurs through collective cell migration in the absence of specific associated mesenchyma . In the kidneys , the ureteric bud ( UB ) elaborates ( from embryonic day ( E ) 11 . 5 in mice ) within a field of specified cells known as the metanephric mesenchyme , which coalesces to form cap mesenchyme ( CM ) niches closely associated with each of the UB tips . These CM cells are nephron progenitors ( Kobayashi et al . , 2008 ) , sub-populations of which sequentially commit to form nephrons as development progresses . They do so by first forming pre-tubular aggregates which undergo mesenchymal to epithelial transition to form renal vesicles ( RV ) that differentiate into comma- and S-shaped bodies that elongate and mature to form nephrons . Because the network established by the branching UB will ultimately form the urine collecting system , the nascent nephrons reconnect to the tip from which they were generated at the comma stage and establish a patent lumen through which urine can be transported ( Kao et al . , 2012; Georgas et al . , 2009 ) . The pervasive role of branching morphogenesis in shaping the development of many organs poses the question as to whether it is governed by shared mechanisms or features . A recent paper by Hannezo et al . has proposed a ‘unifying theory of branching morphogenesis’ ( Hannezo et al . , 2017 ) . This work , based principally on studies in the mammary gland , posits that the elongating tips of the branching mammary tree randomly explore their environment but cease branching and proliferation when in proximity to neighboring branches . It further proposes that developmental morphogenesis in many organs occurs by employing similar stochastic , self-organized approaches characterized by branching and annihilating random walks ( BARW ) . In the kidney , the cessation of branching explicit in the BARW model was proposed to derive from the differentiation of nephrons at individual UB tips . We have investigated a central tenet of this theory - the premise that nephron formation triggers cessation of branching . In doing so , we have examined the broader impact of nephron formation and integration on the behavior of both UB tip and nephron progenitor cell niches . The relationship between these populations is critically important for establishing nephron endowment in the adult kidney; a metric increasingly thought to influence susceptibility to kidney disease and broader physiological measures such as blood pressure ( Luyckx et al . , 2013 ) . We find no evidence that nephron formation can influence the extent of ureteric branching in the developing kidney nor does it alter tip or cap cell proliferation . This indicates that stochastic cessation of branching does not operate during kidney development and demonstrates that nephrogenesis has little to no impact on the progress of branching morphogenesis or the behavior of tip or CM progenitor cells in the developing organ . 2 Results and discussion We have previously profiled the size and cell behavior of the CM and UB tip niches in the developing kidney and correlated this with the rate of branching in the organ ( Short et al . , 2013; Short et al . , 2014 ) . This study showed that branching is most rapid in the period between E12 . 5 and E17 . 5 but did not examine , in detail , the relationship between nephron formation and branching itself . To do so , we used high resolution confocal microscopy to profile the number of connected nephrons per tip from E12 . 5 through to the cessation of nephron formation at postnatal day 3 ( PN3 ) . One prediction of the annihilation model in which nephron formation triggers cessation of branching ( Hannezo et al . , 2017 ) , is that nephron formation should not precede the branching process ( which the model predicts nephron formation will halt ) . Analysis of our confocal data ( Figure 1A ) indicates that almost all the tips of the branching ureteric tree carry an attached nephron 72 hr after branching initiates ( 87% at E14 . 5 ) and that further nephrons are added as development ( and branching ) progresses . We next utilized organ explant cultures to provide supporting evidence that ongoing branching of tips with associated nephrons was indeed possible . Developing kidneys grown in culture lose the 3D structure of an in vivo organ , but retain local CM-UB interactions including branching morphogenesis and nephron induction ( Lindström et al . , 2015; Combes et al . , 2016; Watanabe and Costantini , 2004 ) . Using a Hoxb7-GFP transgene to visualise the ureteric epithelium and bright field illumination to identify forming nephrons across time , we observed tips with attached nephrons undergoing bifurcation ( Figure 1B , Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . All of the UB tips in the developing kidney are localized to the surface of the organ , where they remain throughout development ( Short et al . , 2013; Short et al . , 2014; Short et al . , 2010 ) . Notwithstanding the results derived from organ culture , this observation raises the formal possibility that nephron formation might still impede the branching of tips - but not their growth . In this scenario , for any given tip in which branching ( but not growth ) had ceased , it would be necessary for the branch to lengthen over time in order to maintain its position on the organ surface . If extension of non-branching , nephron-associated tips were continuing we would expect that the maximum tip length would grow with the size of the kidney . Since only a small proportion of tips at any given stage might cease branching , we used the maximum tip length per organ to assess this possibility ( rather than the mean tip length , which might mask any such effects ) . Using this approach , no evidence of maximum tip length extension was observed relative to the increase in axial radius of the fetal organ with age ( Figure 2A , p=0 . 95 ) . Furthermore , if branching were to cease in a subpopulation of developing tips , their generation should remain static at subsequent stages . We therefore examined the distribution of tip branch generations ( the number of branch segments between the root of the tree and each of the tips ) but found no evidence of static branch generations . Instead , the distributions indicate continued branching of all tips ( Figure 2B ) . Simple measurements of nephron number per UB tip do not address how the presence of nephrons might have affected the historical branching behaviour of an individual tip . To better assess the relationship between the nephron ‘phenotype’ of a given tip and its branch history , we employed light sheet microscopy to image whole kidneys at E15 . 5 and then related the number of connected nephrons attached to a given tip with the number of bifurcations between that tip and the pelvis of the developing kidney ( Video 1 ) . Assessment of branch history of 50 tips in the kidney at this age found no evidence to support a relationship between the two measures ( Figure 2D , Pearson’s r = 0 . 014 , p=0 . 9210 ) . Moreover co-labelling for EdU labelled proliferating cells found that high levels of cell division are apparent in tips with connected nephrons ( Video 2 . ) Taken together , these results provide no support for a ‘unifying theory’ in which nephron formation is responsible for the stochastic cessation of ureteric branching . We then examined the broader effects that nephron formation had on cell behaviors associated with nephron formation . In the mammary gland , proximity-associated annihilation of branching has been associated with a profound decrease in cell proliferation ( Scheele et al . , 2017 ) . To examine whether stochastic or more subtle differences in tip cell division might be driven by nephron formation , proliferating cells in embryos at E13 . 5 and E17 . 5 and pups at P2 were labelled with a pulse of the nucleotide analogue EdU and kidneys collected and stained for subsequent confocal imaging of nephrogenic niches . This analysis allowed us to directly relate cell proliferation with the number of connected and associated nephron structures . We found that cell division in the tip cell niches decreases as development progresses ( Figure 3A; p<1e−5 , one-way ANOVA between any two stages ) , which is consistent with our previously reported studies ( Short et al . , 2014 ) . However , we found little association between cell division and the number of total or connected nephron structures ( at E13 . 5 , p=0 . 0587/0 . 79 ( connected/total nephron structures ) , n = 49; E17 . 5 , p=0 . 155/0 . 0296 , n = 50; P2 , p=0 . 06687/0 . 4772 , n = 50 , one-way ANOVA ) . The only exception was at E17 . 5 where there was a weak but significant association between total associated structures , but this was not significant when examining connected nephrons . We then extended this analysis to profile the same measures in the nephron progenitors associated with each tip ( Figure 3B ) to determine whether the differentiation of nephrons might instead impact on the behavior of this cell niche . We found a similar ( and previously described [Short et al . , 2014] ) time-dependent decrease in the rate of proliferation ( p<1e−5 , one way ANOVA ) , which is consistent with recent work detailing the progressive ageing of these cells and the accumulation of intrinsic characteristics , which affect their contribution to nephrogenic programs ( Chen et al . , 2015 ) . However , we again found little relationship between the number of nephrons derived from and/or associated with a given cap cell niche and the rate of cell proliferation in that niche ( E13 . 5 , p=0 . 01827/0 . 3654 ( connected/total nephron structures ) , n = 49; E17 . 5 , p=0 . 3435/0 . 1503 , n = 50; P2 , p=0 . 06605/0 . 921 , n = 50 , one-way ANOVA ) . Together these analyses provide no compelling evidence for an association between nephrogenesis and tip/cap niche proliferation together at any one stage of development . In this study , we have examined whether nephron formation may contribute to a process of stochastic cessation proposed as a unifying theory of branching morphogenesis . Multiple lines of evidence suggest that this is not the case . Integrated nephrons are a feature of almost all tips in the actively branching kidney and live imaging of cultured organs highlights active branching in the presence of attached nephrons . Moreover , hallmarks of ceased branching are not evident in the analysis of terminal tip lengths , the progressive distribution of branch generations over time , rates of cell division or in the correlation between nephron number and branching history of a given tip . In particular , we have found little evidence for a relationship between nephron number and cell proliferation in either the tip cell niches ( where the nephrons integrate ) or in the nephron progenitor cells of the cap mesenchyme from which they derive . The latter observation suggests that nephron progenitors are fated to differentiate based on an internal ‘clock like’ mechanism which is consistent with recent studies ( Chen et al . , 2015 ) . It remains to determine the manner in which individual nephrons remain associated with their tips of origin . Based on our findings , branching morphogenesis during kidney development is a process which differs considerably from the mammary gland . Although they develop in a superficially similar manner ( i . e . through arborisation of an epithelium anlage ) the cellular events which direct these processes and which shape branching are likely significantly different and not dictated by a ‘unifying’ developmental mechanism . Instead , we favour a model in which renal branching more closely mirrors that observed in the lung , another organ whose development is driven by reciprocal epithelial-mesenchymal interactions ( Morrisey and Hogan , 2010 ) . 3 Materials and methods C57Bl6/J mouse embryos were collected and individually staged based on limb and developmental ( Theiler ) criteria as previously described ( Short et al . , 2013 ) . Limb stages ( Wanek et al . , 1989 ) of 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 and 13 were treated as equivalent to E12 . 0 , E12 . 5 , E13 . 25 , E13 . 75 , E14 . 5 , E15 . 5 and E16 . 5 respectively . E19 . 5 was counted as PN0 . For analysis of nephron number per tip whole mount kidneys were stained with antibodies to the elaborating ureteric tree ( pan-Cytokeratin or Ecadherin ) and nephrogenic niches imaged by confocal microscopy following clearing in benyl alcohol:benzyl benzoate ( Combes et al . , 2014 ) . Nephrons were classified from confocal volumes based on morphology and integration into the neighbouring tips . The number of tips profiled at each developmental stage were as follows: E12 . 5 ( 20 ) , E13 . 5 ( 24 ) , E14 . 5 ( 46 ) , E15 . 5 ( 31 ) , E17 . 5 ( 35 ) , E19 . 5/PN0 ( 56 ) , PN1 ( 41 ) , PN2 ( 30 ) . Total tip number from each developmental stage was counted using Optical Projection Tomography and Tree Surveyor software ( Short et al . , 2013 ) up E16 . 5 and by confocal imaging and counting of CM cell niches at later time points using previously described approaches ( Combes et al . , 2014 ) . The number of kidneys profiled at each developmental stage to analyse tip number were as follows: E11 . 5 ( 6 ) , E12 . 5 ( 5 ) , E13 . 25 ( 7 ) , E13 . 75 ( 5 ) , E14 . 5 ( 8 ) , E15 . 5 ( 7 ) , E16 . 5 ( 4 ) , E17 . 5 ( 3 ) , E18 . 5 ( 2 ) , E19 . 5/PN0 ( 3 ) , PN2 ( 3 ) . Hoxb7-EGFP embryos ( Srinivas et al . , 1999 ) were isolated at E12 . 5 and cultured on the lower surface of a transwell membrane insert ( Costar ) in a glass-bottom dish ( Mattek ) in DMEM media ( Sigma ) containing 10% FCS ( Sigma ) . Distance between the insert and coverslip was set at ~70 μm , controlled by a custom metal spacer between the rim of the dish , supplemented by 70 μm beads ( Corpuscular Inc . ) , in a manner analogous to previously reported fixed-Z imaging approaches ( Saarela et al . , 2017 ) . Samples were cultured and imaged at 10x magnification for >40 hr on a Dragonfly spinning disc confocal ( Andor ) in a stage-top incubator at 37 degrees C with 5% CO2 . 80 micron Z-stacks composed of 1 . 95 μm steps were taken every half an hour for GFP and bright field channels . Forming nephrons were identified from bright field images as epithelial structures . Ureteric trees from a staged series of wild type mouse kidneys ( n = 6 , 5 , 7 , 5 , 5 , four for limb stages 7–12 ) were established using Tree Surveyor software ( Short et al . , 2013 ) . Terminal tip length was measured from the final branch point along Tree Surveyor fitted B-splines to the tip extremity . The smallest axial radius was defined as half of the smallest dimension of the bounding box around the tip positions , where the bounding box is aligned according to the eigenvectors of the tip position covariance matrix . The branching generation of a tip is the number of branching events along the path from the ureter to the tip extremity established by the Tree Surveyor software . Pregnant dams ( for E13 . 5 and E17 . 5 ) and P2 pups were injected with EdU ( 50 mg/kg ) and kidneys collected following a 30 min chase period ( Combes et al . , 2014 ) . Organs were then stained with antibodies to Six2 ( Proteintech 115621AP ) , Trop2 ( R and D systems AF1122 ) /pan-Cytokerin ( Abcam AB11213 ) and EdU was detected using a Click-iT EdU Alexa Fluor 647 imaging kit ( Life Technologies ) . Samples were cleared in benzyl alcohol:benzyl benzoate ( Sigma Aldrich ) at a ratio of 1:2 were then imaged using a Leica SP8 confocal microscope at 20X with z-stacks using ~1 AIRY unit spacing per wavelength , and tip and cap niches defined and characterized using reported protocols ( Combes et al . , 2014 ) . Briefly , total and proliferating cell number was quantified in tip and cap niches manually masked using Imaris software ( Bitplane ) . Dissected fetal kidneys at E15 . 5 were stained with DAPI and antibodies to Six2 ( Proteintech 115621AP ) , Trop2 ( R and D systems AF1122 ) , E-cadherin ( Thermo Fisher 13–1900 ) and EdU was detected as previously described ( Combes et al . , 2014 ) . Samples were then imaged on an Ultramicroscope II ( LaVision BioTec ) at ~4 x using a 0 . 52 μm z-step . 50 tips were then analysed for the presence and number of integrated nephrons ( identified morphologically ) and the branch history of each tip traced back to the renal pelvis . The relationship between tip nephron number and branch depth was assessed using R with a Pearson’s product-moment correlation . In order to generate images and videos of whole mount branching with nephrons , the Trop2 signal data ( strongly staining ureteric tree only ) were subtracted from the E-cadherin signal data ( strongly staining both ureteric Tree and mature nephrons ) using the Image J image calculator . These data were visualized using Imaris and Drishti ( Limaye , 2012 ) ."}

It describes a biological process in which a living cell breaks down its own material to release their chemical building blocks that can then be used to make new molecules . Autophagy is often triggered when a cell becomes damaged or when nutrients are in short supply . The hallmark of autophagy is the formation of structures called autophagosomes . These structures capture the cellular material , fuse with other compartments in the cell – namely endosomes in animals and vacuoles in yeast – and then deliver the material inside , ready to be broken down . For an autophagosome to fuse to an endosome or a vacuole , small proteins of the Rab protein family must be located on the surface of the autophagosome . Rab proteins are recruited to this surface by enzymes known as GEFs . However it remains unclear how most GEFs get to the surface of a compartment within the cell to begin with . The Mon1-Ccz1 complex is a GEF that occurs in yeast and animals , including fruit flies and humans . It is found on endosomes , and was recently shown to also localize to autophagosomes . Now , Gao et al . report that , in yeast , the Mon1-Ccz1 complex binds directly to a protein named Atg8 . This protein is anchored on to the surface of autophagosomes , and is closely related to other proteins in animal cells . Gao et al . discovered that this specific GEF binds to Atg8 via at least one binding site on its Ccz1 component . This binding site is only needed for the GEF to localize to the autophagosomes; the Mon1-Czz1 complex can still bind to endosomes without it . Blocking the GEF from binding to Atg8 stopped the autophagosomes from fusing with vacuoles . These findings reveal how a GEF can be targeted to two distinct compartments in the cell: endosomes and autophagosomes . Further work is now needed to understand how this process is regulated by the availability of nutrients or damage to the cell , to ensure that autophagy is only triggered under the right conditions . Also , because cancer cells often rely on autophagy to survive , the molecules that regulate this process could represent possible targets for new anticancer drugs .", "article": "1 Introduction Macroautophagy , called here autophagy , is an important quality control pathway , during which cellular material such as organelles and cytosolic components are engulfed by a double-membrane vesicles , the autophagosome ( Shibutani and Yoshimori , 2014; Mizushima et al . , 2011 ) . In both yeast and mammals , autophagosome formation is a complex process that begins with the assembly of the phagophore or isolation membrane . Once complete , the autophagosome first fuses with endosomes to form an amphisome and then with lysosomes in mammalian cells , while it directly fuse with the lysosome-like vacuole in yeast ( Lamb et al . , 2013; Chen and Klionsky , 2011 ) . How autophagosomes become fusion competent with lysosomes is still poorly understood . Like for other fusion events , autophagosome fusion with vacuoles or endosomes requires SNAREs , Rab GTPases ( Rabs ) and the HOPS tethering complex ( Reggiori and Ungermann , 2017; Barr , 2013; Kümmel and Ungermann , 2014 ) . Rabs have a central role in this fusion cascade . They are held soluble in the cytosol by the GDP-dissociation inhibitor ( GDI ) proteins , which bind GDP-loaded Rabs . Once on membranes , a Rab-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor ( GEF ) converts Rabs into their active GTP-form ( Barr , 2013 ) . This allows their interaction with effectors such as tethering factors ( Kümmel and Ungermann , 2014 ) . The Rab7 GTPase is required for the fusion of endosomes with lysosomes and lysosomal transport ( Nordmann et al . , 2012 ) . In yeast , the Rab7-homolog Ypt7 binds to the HOPS tethering complex in this process , which in turn supports SNARE assembly and fusion . Rab7 as well as Ypt7 are also required for fusion of autophagosomes with endosomes ( Gutierrez et al . , 2004; Ganley et al . , 2011; McEwan et al . , 2015 ) and detected on autophagosomes ( Hegedűs et al . , 2016 ) . The conserved Mon1-Ccz1 GEF complex triggers endosomal maturation by activating Ypt7 ( or Rab7 in metazoans ) primarily on late endosomes ( Nordmann et al . , 2010; Gerondopoulos et al . , 2012; Singh et al . , 2014; Cui et al . , 2014 ) , but likely also on autophagosomes ( Hegedűs et al . , 2016 ) . In agreement with this notion , it has been shown that yeast Mon1-Ccz1 is essential for autophagy progression ( Wang et al . , 2002 ) . As Mon1-Ccz1 can interact with Rab5-GTP , Rab5 may promote Rab7 recruitment to endosomes , possibly with support by the local generation of phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate ( PI-3-P ) ( Singh et al . , 2014; Hegedűs et al . , 2016; Cui et al . , 2014 ) . It remains unresolved , however , how Mon1-Ccz1 is specifically targeted to autophagosomes to trigger SNARE-mediated fusion ( Figure 1A ) . The SNAREs involved in this event have been implicated in previous studies ( Darsow et al . , 1997; Fischer von Mollard and Stevens , 1999; Dilcher et al . , 2001; Sato et al . , 1998; Reggiori and Ungermann , 2017 ) . Atg8 is one of 16 conserved autophagy-related ( Atg ) proteins , which are essential for autophagosome formation , and it possesses six mammalian homologues ( Shpilka et al . , 2012 ) . Members of the Atg8/LC3 protein family are conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine ( PE ) at the autophagosome membrane , and interact with several Atg proteins via a LC3 interacting region ( LIR motif ) to control both maturation and fusion ( Wild et al . , 2014; Nakatogawa et al . , 2007; Klionsky and Schulman , 2014; Abreu et al . , 2017 ) . Here , we demonstrate that Atg8 recruits the endosomal GEF Mon1-Ccz1 to the pre-autophagosomal structure . Mutants in a LIR motif present in the Ccz1 C-terminal do not impair GEF activity or endosomal function , but block autophagosome fusion with vacuoles . Our data thus reveal how a GEF can mark two different organelles with the same Rab for fusion via distinct mechanisms . 2 Results To determine the direct binding site in the Ccz1 C-terminal , we compared the C-termini of multiple Ccz1 homologs . As metazoan Ccz1 is shorter than yeast Ccz1 , we narrowed our search on the conserved fragment and identified the putative LIR motifs ( https://ilir . warwick . ac . uk; Figure 3A ) . We generated the corresponding mutants by changing the aromatic W0 and the hydrophobic L4 residues into alanines . Among the nine mutants ( Figure 3A ) , two showed impaired GFP-Ccz1 localization to mCherry-Atg8-positive autophagosomes under nitrogen starvation conditions , that is Y236A V239A ( named LIR1 ) and Y445A L448A ( LIR2 ) ( Figure 3B , C , E ) . These two motifs are highly conserved across species ( Figure 3B ) . However , we noticed that trafficking of mCherry-tagged Atg8 to the vacuole was not totally compromised in the single mutants at normal growth temperature ( Figure 3C ) . We therefore combined both mutations and nitrogen starved the cells . This resulted in a complete block of autophagy in the double mutant as shown by defects in Atg8 delivery and processing in the vacuole ( Figure 3C and F ) , but also vacuole morphology ( Figures 3C and 4D ) . Under these conditions , numerous mCherry-Atg8-positive autophagosomes accumulated in the cytoplasm , consistent with a defect in fusion with vacuoles . The LIR1 , 2 mutant behaves thus as the Ccz1∆C mutant , and is likewise compromised in both autophagy and vacuole biogenesis in general ( Figures 2F and 3C , F ) . We therefore focused on the single mutants . We were wondering why the single LIR mutants were still functional , even though Ccz1 targeting seemed diminished . We considered the possibility that the LIR mutants may be impaired at higher temperature , and thus repeated the starvation assay at 37°C ( Figure 3D ) . Although the wild-type cells were functional in autophagy , both LIR mutants now accumulated Atg8-positive autophagosomes in cells ( Figure 3D , quantified in E ) . To test if these LIR mutants indeed compromise binding to Atg8 , we produced and used the mutants in Atg8 binding assays ( see Figure 2D–F ) . Both LIR1 and the LIR1 , 2 double mutants could be purified as wild-type Mon1-Ccz1 from yeast , indicating that they were not destabilizing the complex ( Figure 4A ) . However , they showed poor interaction with Atg8 ( Figure 4B , C ) . As we encounter major problems in the purification of the Mon1-Ccz1 complex with LIR2 , we did not further pursue it in our in vitro analyses . Nonetheless , these data agree with a model , where one and possibly two Ccz1 LIR motifs are required for the recruitment of Mon1-Ccz1 to Atg8 . Our data suggest an important function of the one and possibly two LIR motifs in directing Mon1-Ccz1 to autophagosomes . As vacuole morphology of the LIR1 and LIR2 mutants was only mildly impaired during heat stress ( Figures 3D and 4D ) , we asked if endosomal trafficking was functional in these mutants . The vacuolar hydrolase carboxypeptidase Y ( CPY ) , which is normally sorted from the Golgi via the endosome to the vacuole , is lost from cells in mutants impaired in vacuole biogenesis such as vps39∆ or the temperature sensitive mutant vps11-1 at 37°C ( Figure 4E ) . Likewise , ccz1∆ cells have less intracellular CPY . However , both LIR mutants in Ccz1 were entirely unperturbed also at elevated temperature or when cells were starved . As a second assay , we traced the sorting of the methionine transporter Mup1 from the plasma membrane to the vacuole ( Arlt et al . , 2015 ) . In both wild-type cells and the LIR mutants , Mup1-GFP was mainly at the plasma membrane in the absence of methionine , but was efficiently sorted to the vacuole lumen when methionine was added after the temperature shift to 37°C ( Figure 4F ) . This sorting remained unaffected at higher temperatures as well . We therefore conclude that the LIR1 and LIR2 mutants selectively disable Mon1-Ccz1 targeting to autophagosomes , whereas endosomal function of Mon1-Ccz1 remains unperturbed under the same conditions . Our data imply that Atg8 is indeed a primary determinant to recruit Mon1-Ccz1 to autophagosomes . We used our Mon1-Ccz1 LIR1 mutant to directly test this hypothesis as this was the best behaving complex . From previous in vitro experiments with purified organelles and proteins we have learned that mutations can compromise protein function in vitro much more clearly than in vivo ( Bröcker et al . , 2012; Ungermann et al . , 1999 ) . We therefore took advantage of GEF assay that we developed before to monitor Mon1-Ccz1 activity on membrane-bound Ypt7 ( Cabrera et al . , 2014 ) . C-terminally His-tagged Ypt7 was preloaded with the MANT-GDP nucleotide , which looses fluorescence when exchanged for non-fluorescent GTP . In the presence of liposomes carrying the His-interacting DOGS-NTA lipid , and the nucleotide exchange reaction is strongly enhanced when Mon1-Ccz1 is also recruited onto the liposome surface ( Cabrera et al . , 2014 ) . Using this assay , we compared wild-type and LIR1 mutated Mon1-Ccz1 complex ( Figure 5A ) . Both complexes had similar activity for Ypt7 ( Figure 5A , D ) . We then lowered the Mon1-Ccz1 concentration in our assay to test whether Mon1-Ccz1 targeting and function could depend on membrane-bound Atg8 . Indeed , membrane-targeted Atg8-His , but not soluble Atg8 , stimulated the GTP exchange reaction ( Figure 5B , D ) , presumably due to its ability to recruit the GEF complex to membranes . In contrast , the Mon1-Ccz1 LIR mutant did not respond to the addition of Atg8 ( Figure 5C , D ) . Our data thus show that membrane-bound Atg8 can recruit Mon1-Ccz1 to membranes to promote Ypt7 activation . 3 Discussion Previous studies showed that artificial redirection of GEFs can redirect different Rabs to other membranes ( Blümer et al . , 2013; Gerondopoulos et al . , 2012 ) , yet the molecular determinants that target GEFs to their correct membrane are only partially known and rarely experimentally validated . Autophagosomes form de novo and finally fuses with lysosomes ( Reggiori and Ungermann , 2017 ) . Like maturing endosomes , autophagosomes need to acquire the machinery to allow their fusion with lysosomes , including the Rab7/Ypt7 GTPase . Here we have uncovered a simple molecular mechanism that specifically targets the GEF Mon1-Ccz1 onto the surface of autophagosomes . The Ccz1 subunit has at least one conserved C-terminal LIR motif , which directly binds to the LC3 homolog Atg8 . Once on autophagosomes , Mon1-Ccz1 recruits and activates the Rab7-like Ypt7 from the cytosol , which in turn can bind the HOPS tethering complex to trigger SNARE-mediated fusion . We indeed found recent evidence that Mon1-Ccz1 is sufficient to activate Ypt7 , which was provided in a soluble complex with GDI , and thus triggered fusion in a reconstituted assay ( Langemeyer et al . , 2018 ) . Similarly , the TRAPP GEF complexes could activate their corresponding Rab-GDI complexes on membranes ( Thomas and Fromme , 2016 ) . In agreement with this interpretation , only wild type but not LIR-mutated Mon1-Ccz1 strongly promotes Ypt7 activation in the presence of membrane-localized Atg8 ( Figure 5E ) . Our data imply that lipidated Atg8 is a specific determinant to redirect Mon1-Ccz1 to autophagosomes . In addition to Atg8 , PI-3-P may support re-localization to both endosomes and autophagosomes ( Hegedűs et al . , 2016; Cabrera et al . , 2014 ) . Indeed , deletion of Atg14 in Drosophila fat cells appears to affect autophagosome fusion in addition to altering the biogenesis of these vesicles ( Hegedűs et al . , 2016 ) . The generation of autophagosomal PI-3-P is required for multiple events , including efficient Atg8 lipidation ( Shibutani and Yoshimori , 2014 ) . Interestingly , Mon1-Ccz1 localization to Atg8 positive dots was not impaired if synthesis of the autophagosome-specific PI-3-P pool was blocked by atg14 deletion ( Figure 2C ) . We consider it therefore unlikely that PI-3-P synthesis is a primary factor for Mon1-Ccz1 localization to autophagosomes . In contrast , our analysis suggests that PI-3-P may be critical for Mon1-Ccz1 activity , which could explain the defect in Ypt7 localization to autophagosomes of the atg14Δ mutant . Alternatively , PI-3-P might directly support the recruitment of Ypt7 , even though we have evidence that Mon1-Ccz1 activity is most critical in this process ( Langemeyer et al . , 2018 ) . How the reported PI-3-P binding ( Lawrence et al . , 2014; Cabrera et al . , 2014 ) affects Mon1-Ccz1 function needs to be further dissected . Future studies will also need to explore how Mon1-Ccz1 is timely and spatially recruited to autophagosomes . Importantly , our study reveals that Mon1-Ccz1 is functional in the endocytic pathway , when its LIR motifs are singularly mutated . This provides further evidence that Mon1-Ccz1 has a dual role and two different targeting mechanisms for two distinct organelles . By identifying the LIR mutants , we established one of the few conditions that might accumulate fully assembled autophagosomes , which are incompetent of fusing with vacuoles , while maintaining endosome-vacuole fusion and thus vacuoles functional . In mammalian cells , additional proteins such as PLEKHM1 ( McEwan et al . , 2015 ) have been identified as factors involved in the fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes . Interestingly , PLEKHM1 directly binds LC3-like proteins and Rab7 , and could thus support HOPS-mediated tethering and fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes . We believe that GEFs such as Mon1-Ccz1 are the most critical factors to confine Rab localization and thus determine organelle identity . The cooperation with LC3-like proteins could then provide a combinatorial code to target GEFs and additional fusion factors to autophagosomes . Interestingly , Atg8 is not homogenously distributed over the surface of forming autophagosomes ( Graef et al . , 2013 ) , and could potentially cluster fusion factors to facilitate their cooperation during fusion . How Atg8 recycling and fusion are then coordinated ( Abreu et al . , 2017 ) , it is yet another exciting riddle to be dissected . At least Mon1-Ccz1 localization to autophagosomes might be dispensable , once Rab7/Ypt7 is recruited and bound to HOPS . Recent work of us and others revealed that GEFs can recruit Rab GTPases from the GDI complex to membranes ( Langemeyer et al . , 2018 ) ( Thomas and Fromme , 2016 ) . The identification of Atg8 as a determinant for Mon1-Ccz1 localization to autophagosomes provides the first example of how a GEF can be diverted to a different location . Differential spatiotemporal recruitment of GEFs allows cells to operate distinct pathways , such as autophagy and endosomal maturation , depending on their metabolic needs while employing the same machinery . For endosomal localization , Rab5-GTP has been suggested as a Mon1-Ccz1 interactor based on yeast-two-hybrid interactions ( Li et al . , 2015; Cui et al . , 2014; Singh et al . , 2014; Kinchen and Ravichandran , 2010 ) . Future studies will need to dissect if this order of events can be indeed recapitulated in vitro and how further endosomal and autophagosomal factors specify GEF localization . 4 Materials and methods Strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Supplementary file 1 and 2 , respectively . Deletions and tagging of genes were done by homologous recombination of respective PCR fragments ( Janke et al . , 2004; Puig et al . , 1998 ) . Mon1 and Ccz1 mutants were generated by QuikChange mutagenesis ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) . Mon1 and Ccz1 truncation mutants have been published ( Kiontke et al . , 2017 ) . Plasmids encoding GST-Atg8 and Atg8-His6 were kindly provided by Ivan Dikic ( Goethe University School of Medicine , Frankfurt am Main , Germany ) , and Sascha Martens ( University of Vienna , Austria ) , respectively . Tandem affinity purification was performed as described ( Bröcker et al . , 2012; Lürick et al . , 2017 ) . Six liters of culture in YPG were grown at 30°C to OD600 of 6 , and cells were harvested and lysed in lysis buffer ( 300 mM NaCl , 50 mM HEPES-NaOH , pH 7 . 4 , 1 . 5 mM MgCl2 , 1 × FY protease inhibitor mix ( Serva , Germany ) , 0 . 5 mM PMSF and 1 mM DTT ) . Lysates were centrifuged for 1 hr at 100 , 000 g , and the cleared supernatant was incubated with IgG Sepharose beads ( GE Healthcare , Penzberg , Germany ) for 2 hr at 4°C . Beads were collected by centrifugation at 800 g for 2 min , and washed with ice cold 15 ml lysis buffer containing 0 . 5 mM DTT and 10% glycerol . Bound proteins were eluted by TEV cleavage overnight at 4°C . Purified proteins were analyzed on SDS-PAGE . Atg8 was purified from E . coli BL21 ( DE3 ) Rosetta cells . Cells were grown to an OD600 of 0 . 6 and induced with 0 . 5 mM IPTG overnight at 16°C . Cells were lysed in lysis buffer ( 50 mM HEPES/NaOH , pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM PMSF , 1x protease inhibitor cocktail ( 1x = 0 . 1 mg/ml of leupeptin , 1 mM o-phenanthroline , 0 . 5 mg/ml of pepstatin A , 0 . 1 mM Pefabloc ) ) . Lysates were centrifuged for 20 min at 30 , 000 g , and the cleared supernatant was incubated with Glutathione Sepharose ( GSH ) beads ( for GST-tagged proteins ) or Ni-NTA beads ( for His-tagged proteins ) for 1 hr at 4°C on a nutator . Beads were washed with 20 ml cold lysis buffer ( GSH-beads ) or lysis buffer containing 20 mM imidazole ( Ni-NTA beads ) . Bound proteins were eluted with buffer containing 15 mM reduced glutathione ( GSH-beads ) or buffer containing 300 mM imidazole ( Ni-NTA beads ) . Buffer was exchanged to 50 mM HEPES/NaOH , pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl , and 10% glycerol by using a NAP-10 column ( GE Healthcare , Penzberg , Germany ) . To perform GST pull down binding assays , GST or GST-fused Atg8 wild type or Atg8 mutants or ubiquitin were used as bait , and Mon1-Ccz1 was used as a prey . GST or GST-tagged proteins ( 150 µg ) were simultaneously incubated with GSH-beads for 1 hr at 4°C on a rotating wheel . Beads were washed three times with buffer ( 150 mM NaCl , 50 mM HEPES/NaOH , pH 7 . 4 , 1 . 5 mM MgCl2 , 0 . 1% NP-40 ) , and the GSH-bound proteins were then incubated with Mon1-Ccz1 ( 25 µg ) for 2 hr at 4°C on a rotating wheel . Beads were again washed three times in buffer . Bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS-sample buffer , resolved on SDS gels , and either analyzed by Coomassie Blue staining or immunoblotting with anti-CbP antibodies ( Lürick et al . , 2017 ) . Yeast cells were first cultured in YPD media to log phase , and then switched to synthetic minimal medium lacking nitrogen ( SD-N ) for the indicated times to induce starvation . For CMAC staining of vacuoles , cells were incubated with 0 . 1 CMAC for 15 min at 30°C and subsequent washed with medium . Cells were imaged on a Deltavision Elite imaging system based on an inverted microscopy , equipped with 100x NA 1 . 49 and 60x NA 1 . 40 objectives , a sCMOS camera ( PCO , Kelheim , Germany ) , an InsightSSI illumination system , and SoftWoRx software ( Applied Precision , Issaquah , WA ) . Stacks of 6 or 8 images with 0 . 2 µm spacing were taken for constrained-iterative deconvolution ( SoftWoRx ) and quantification . GEF assays were performed as described ( Nordmann et al . , 2010; Cabrera et al . , 2014 ) . 60 pmoles Atg8-His were incubated with 60 µl multilamellar vesicles ( MLVs , 15 mM ) of the following composition ( palmitoyloleoyl phosphatidylcholine , 84 mol% , palmitoyloleoyl phosphatidylcholine 10 mol% , DOGS-NTA ( 1 , 2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[ ( N- ( 5-amino-1-carboxypentyl ) iminodiacetic acid ) succinyl] ) , 6 mol% ) for 15 min at 25°C . 500 pmoles Ypt7-His were preloaded with MANT-GDP , and incubated with MLVs for 5 min at 25°C before addition of the Mon1–Ccz1 complex . MANT fluorescence was detected in a SpectraMax M3 Multi-Mode Microplate Reader ( Molecular Devices , Germany ) . Samples were excited at 355 nm and fluorescence was detected at 448 nm . After 20–30 min , 0 . 1 mM GTP was added to trigger the exchange reaction . The decrease of MANT-GDP fluorescence is an indicator of nucleotide exchange . Yeast cells ( carry the plasmid pRS315-CUP1pr-BFP-APE1 ) were grown overnight in SDC-LEU medium , then diluted to early log phase next morning . 250 µM CuSO4 was added to induce the giant Ape1 oligomer formation for 4 hr , and cultures were then switched to SD-N medium containing 250 µM CuSO4 for 1 hr to induce autophagy ."}

Archaea are similar to bacteria in that they do not have nuclei , but genetically they have more in common with eukaryotes . Archaea are found in a wide range of habitats including the human colon , marshlands , the ocean and extreme environments such as hot springs and salt lakes . It has been known since the 1990s that the DNA of archaea is wrapped around histones to form complexes that closely resemble the nucleosomes found in eukaryotes , albeit with four rather than eight histone subunits . Nucleosomes are the fundamental units of chromatin , the highly-ordered and compact structure that all the DNA in a cell is packed into . Now we know exactly how many nucleosomes are present in a given cell for some eukaryotes , notably yeast , and to a good approximation we know the position of each nucleosome during a variety of metabolic states and physiological conditions . We can also quantify the nucleosome occupancy , which is measure of the length of time that the nucleosomes spend in contact with the DNA: this is a critical piece of information because it determines the level of access that other proteins , including those that regulate gene expression , have to the DNA . These advances have been driven in large part by advances in technology , notably high-density microarrays for genome wide-studies of nucleosome occupancy , and massively parallel sequencing for direct nucleosome sequencing . Ammar et al . have used these techniques to explore how the DNA of Haloferax volcanii , a species of archaea that thrives in the hyper-salty waters of the Dead Sea , is organized on a genome-wide basis . Despite some clear differences between the genomes of archaea and eukaryotes—for example , genomic DNA is typically circular in archaea and linear in eukaryotes—they found that the genome of Hfx . volcanii is organized into chromatin in a way that is remarkably similar to that seen in all eukaryotic genomes studied to date . This is surprising given that the chromatin in eukaryotes is confined to the nucleus , whereas there are no such constraints in archaea . In particular , Ammar et al . found that those regions of the DNA near the ends of genes that mark where the transcription of the DNA into RNA should begin and end contain have lower nucleosome occupancy than other regions . Moreover , the overall level of occupancy in Hfx . volcanii was twice that of eukaryotes , which is what one would expect given that nucleosomes in archaea contain half as many histone subunits as nucleosomes in eukaryotes . Ammar et al . also confirmed that that the degree of nucleosome occupancy is correlated with gene expression . These two findings—the similarities between the chromatin in archaea and eukaryotes , and the correlation between nucleosome occupancy and gene expression in archaea—raise an interesting evolutionary possibility: the initial function of nucleosomes and chromatin formation might have been for the regulation of gene expression rather than the packaging of DNA . This is consistent with two decades of research that has shown that there is an extraordinary and complex relationship between the structure of chromatin and the process of gene expression . It is possible , therefore , that as the early eukaryotes evolved , nucleosomes and chromatin started to package DNA into compact structures that , among other things , helped to prevent DNA damage , and that this subsequently enabled the early eukaryotes to flourish .", "article": "1 Introduction Archaeal nucleosome core particles protect ∼60 bp of DNA , approximately half that of eukaryotic nucleosomes , as demonstrated by the landmark work of Pereira et al . ( 1997 ) . Comparing both eukaryotic and archaeal nucleosomes , the former is an octamer composed of heterodimers of histones H2A , H2B , H3 and H4 whereas the latter histones assemble from homologs of H3 and H4 proteins ( Pereira and Reeve , 1998; Talbert and Henikoff , 2010 ) . Archaeal histones can form both homodimers and heterodimers , as well as homotetramers , whereas eukaryotic histones contain hydrophobic dimerization surfaces that restrict assembly of the octamer from H2A-H2B and H3-H4 heterodimers ( Sandman and Reeve , 2006; Talbert and Henikoff , 2010 ) . Using single-nucleotide resolution maps of archaeal nucleosome occupancy and gene expression , we demonstrate that the architecture of archaeal chromatin and the occupancy of its nucleosomes along transcription units are conserved . We constructed a nucleosome occupancy map of the halophilic archaeon Haloferax volcanii , a member of the phylum euryarchaeota , originally discovered in the highly saline sediment of the Dead Sea ( Mullakhanbhai and Larsen , 1975 ) . The genome of Hfx . volcanii has an average GC content of 65% and a total genome length of 4 Mb ( Hartman et al . , 2010 ) composed of five circular genetic elements: a 2 . 8 Mb main chromosome , three smaller chromosomes pHV1 , pHV3 and pHV4 and the plasmid pHV2 . It is highly polyploid with ∼15 genome copies during exponential growth and ∼10 during stationary phase ( Breuert et al . , 2006 ) . The histone protein of Hfx . volcanii , hstA ( HVO_0520 ) , has a domain architecture containing two distinct histone fold domains within the same peptide that heterodimerize similar to the Methanopyrus kandleri histone ( HMk ) ( Geer et al . , 2002; Talbert and Henikoff , 2010; Marchler-Bauer et al . , 2011 ) . 2 Results We cultured Hfx . volcanii in rich media containing 2 M NaCl ( Mullakhanbhai and Larsen , 1975 ) . Genomic DNA was cross-linked and digested with micrococcal nuclease ( MNase ) , with cell disruption accomplished by bead-beating ( Tsui et al . , 2012 ) . Nucleosome-bound cross-linked genomic regions are protected from MNase digestion , in contrast to the linker DNA between nucleosomes . Mononucleosome-sized ( 50–60 bp ) DNA fragments were gel purified and libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2000 ( Figure 1A ) . Sequence reads were aligned to the published Hfx . volcanii DS2 genome ( Hartman et al . , 2010 ) to generate a genome-wide nucleosome occupancy map . Controls included crosslinked DNA without MNase digestion as well as MNase treated nucleosome-free genomic DNA . The nucleosome occupancy data was significantly different than the control MNase digest of deproteinized ‘naked’ genomic DNA ( r = 0 . 071 ) , indicating that the nucleosome map is unaffected by any potential MNase sequence bias ( Chung et al . , 2010 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 00078 . 003Figure 1 . Micrococcal nuclease digestion produces nucleosomal fragments from crosslinked Hfx . volcanii chromatin . ( A ) Formaldehyde cross-linked chromatin was subjected to MNase digestion with increasing amounts on microccocal nuclease ( from 1 to 5 units ) . De-crosslinked DNAs were separated on a 3% agarose gel and ∼60 bp and ∼120 bp mono- and di-nucleosomes were observed . Markers ( M ) indicate *50 bp and **150 bp . ( B ) The counts of AA , AT , TA , TT or CC , CG , GC , GG dinucleotides are reported at each position showing an enrichment of G/C nucleotides and a depletion of A/T nucleotides at the dyad relative to the end points of the protected fragment . This differs from the observation of Bailey et al . ( 2000 ) , where GC , AA and TA dinucleotides were repeated at ∼10-bp intervals in recombinant archaeal histone B from Methanothermus fervidus ( rHMfB ) ( Bailey et al . , 2000 ) . ( C ) The sequence logo of a nucleosome-binding site in Hfx . volcanii centered at the nucleosome midpoint . There is a significant GC enrichment towards the nucleosome midpoint . This is exhibited using both bit score and probability measures . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 00078 . 003 To determine nucleosome midpoints , we smoothed the occupancy data using a symmetrical convolution sum with a Gaussian filter ( Smith , 1997 ) . Extrema were detected in the smoothed signal , and maxima were defined as nucleosome midpoints . In the smoothed signal , the mean peak-to-peak distance for the main chromosome was 68 . 5 bp in genic regions and 76 . 1 bp in non-genic regions . Genic regions were defined as the transcribed region plus 40 bp ( the average promoter length based on Palmer and Daniels , 1995 ) upstream of the 5′ end . We observed a greater nucleosome density in Hfx . volcanii vs all eukaryotes likely due to the shorter length of DNA wrapped around the archaeal histone tetramer ( Pereira et al . , 1997 ) . Based on our data , the Hfx . volcanii genome has 14 . 2 nucleosomes per kilobase compared to 5 . 2 nucleosomes per kilobase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae . The resulting map reveals a periodic pattern similar to that seen in all eukaryotes examined to date; with protected regions appearing as peaks and linker regions as troughs . Sequence analysis of the entire nucleosome map showed that nucleosome midpoints were enriched with G/C nucleotides from 61 . 4% GC at the edge of the protected fragment to 74 . 6% GC at the midpoint ( dyad ) . We found an increase of G/C nucleotides and a decrease in A/T nucleotides at the midpoint , as described recently for human cell lines ( Figure 1B , C ) ( Valouev et al . , 2011 ) . In contrast to previous studies in eukaryotes , we did not observe a periodicity in dinucleotide frequency relative to the nucleosome midpoint ( Satchwell et al . , 1986; Bailey et al . , 2000; Albert et al . , 2007 ) . We next investigated the relationship between nucleosome occupancy and gene expression . The existing genome annotation for Haloferax is derived almost exclusively from ORF predictions ( Hartman et al . , 2010 ) . To augment these predictions , we used deep sequencing to create a high confidence transcriptome of the main chromosome of Hfx . volcanii . This map allowed us to define both 5′UTR lengths , transcriptional start sites ( TSSs ) and transcriptional termination sites ( TTSs ) . Total RNA was extracted from Hfx . volcanii cells , repetitive RNA was partially depleted via duplex-specific nuclease ( DSN ) normalization followed by RNA-seq ( see ‘Materials and methods’ ) ( Zhulidov et al . , 2004 ) . Transcript sequences were aligned , assembled and quantified using TopHat and the Genome Analysis Toolkit ( Trapnell et al . , 2009; McKenna et al . , 2010 ) and transcript boundaries were further trimmed based on RNA-seq coverage information , as described previously ( Wurtzel et al . , 2010 ) . The final set of transcripts were manually curated yielding 3059 transcriptional units in Hfx . volcanii , a number that is greater than observed previously in the comparable transcriptome of the sulfur-metabolizing archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus ( Wurtzel et al . , 2010 ) but fewer than the 4073 predicted Hfx . volcanii genes . It is likely that in the rich media conditions used in this study , not all genes are expressed . Specifically 75% of the predicted transcripts were detectably expressed , and this fraction is consistent with observations obtained for yeast gene expression in rich media ( David et al . , 2006 ) . Thirty-two novel transcripts ( absent from the predicted sequence annotation ) were identified in the RNA-seq data . Most of these 32 transcripts lack significant sequence homologs , and several were classified as transposases with paralogs in Hfx . volcanii ( Supplementary file 1 ) . Notably , the gene that was most highly expressed in the transcriptome ( NTRANS_0004 ) was not previously annotated and contains a putative N-Acyltransferase ( NAT ) superfamily domain . Homology searches revealed that this transcript appears to be restricted to the genomes of other halophilic archaea ( Altschul et al . , 1990 ) . The architecture of this domain is homologous to chain A of the well-characterized histone acetyltransferases Gcn5 , Gna1 , Hpa2 in S . cerevisiae , suggesting a possible role for this transcript in regulating transcription via histone acetylation ( Marchler-Bauer et al . , 2011 ) . Additional acyltransferases with a similar architecture have been implicated in bacteriophage-encoded DNA modifiers as well as in cold and ethanol tolerance in yeast ( Du and Takagi , 2007; Kaminska and Bujnicki , 2008 ) . Thus , while histone post-translational modifications have not been observed in archaeal histones ( Forbes et al . , 2004 ) , our observation suggests that some rudimentary control over chromatin accessibility may occur via the action of ancient NAT family members . Furthermore acetyltransferase and deacetylase orthologs , which appear to have enzymatic activity based on their sensitivity to the histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibitor trichostatin A have been identified in Hfx . volcanii ( Altman-Price and Mevarech , 2009 ) . In our subsequent analysis , we focused on all genes we empirically determined to be expressed . In eukaryotes , the TSS of the majority of expressed genes is characterized by a nucleosome-depleted region ( NDR ) ( Jiang and Pugh , 2009 ) . This NDR is flanked by the well-positioned −1 and the +1 nucleosomes . These regions direct RNA polymerase II to initiate transcription and influence the binding of promoter regulatory elements ( Jiang and Pugh , 2009 ) . This stereotypical pattern of nucleosome depletion at promoters and well-ordered nucleosomes in gene bodies is found in all eukaryotes , including yeast , Drosophila , Arabidopsis and humans . Using the RNA-seq-derived transcripts for Hfx . volcanii , we computed the degree of aggregate nucleosome occupancy for the 2343 transcripts on the main chromosome , and found that the NDR and −1 and +1 nucleosomes are conserved in Hfx . volcanii ( Figure 2 ) suggesting that the interplay between chromatin and transcription is conserved in archaeal promoters . We generated nucleosome occupancy profiles for each transcript and clustered them hierarchically . Differential nucleosome density was observed with profiles encompassing between four to six nucleosomes in a 400-bp DNA segment spanning 200 bp on each side of the TSS ( Figure 2C ) . NDRs at TTSs are also observed , and similar to those found in eukaryotes ( Lee et al . , 2007 ) they are less prominent than promoter NDRs in Hfx . volcanii ( Figure 3 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 00078 . 004Figure 2 . Nucleosome occupancy in Haloferax volcanii . ( A ) Degree of normalized nucleosome occupancy in aggregate for the main chromosome . As observed in eukaryotes , there is a prominent nucleosome-depleted region ( NDR ) at the transcriptional start site ( TSS ) preceded by a −1 nucleosome and followed by a +1 nucleosome , demonstrating that promoter genome architecture is conserved between archaea and eukaryotes . ( B ) Hierarchical clustergram for the 2343 expressed transcripts on the main Haloferax chromosome . Green represents nucleosome-depleted regions and red represents occupied regions . ( C ) The clustered heatmap was subdivided into the largest six subclades , and differential density of nucleosomes can be observed with occupancy profile clusters containing between four to six nucleosomes .

As observed in eukaryotes , NDRs are also found at the transcriptional termination sites in Hfx . volcanii . Both 5′ and 3′ end profiles are overlaid in this figure for comparison . The 5′ NDR is , on average , more depleted and longer . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 00078 . 005 3 Discussion Our study establishes that genome-wide nucleosome occupancy is conserved between archaea and eukaryotes ( Figure 4 ) . We further show that the nucleosomal protected fragments and NDRs are shorter in archaea than in eukaryotes . Our findings are particularly noteworthy because Hfx . volcanii likely resembles a deeply rooted ancestor that possessed eukaryotic genome architecture hallmarks such as histones , as well as bacterial hallmarks such as the Shine-Dalgarno sequence ( Sartorius-Neef and Pfeifer , 2004 ) . Archaeal histone tetramers likely resemble an ancestral state of chromatin , as it has been observed that functional ( H3-H4 ) 2 tetramers can be formed in vitro from eukaryotic histones , and these tetramers are functional; they facilitate more rapid transcription in vitro compared to native histone octamers ( Puerta et al . , 1993 ) . The observation that archaea contain ( H3-H4 ) 2 tetramers is consistent with the proposal that formation of the canonical eukaryotic nucleosome octamer begins with ( H3-H4 ) 2 tetramer assembly ( Talbert and Henikoff , 2010 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 00078 . 006Figure 4 . Chromatin architecture is conserved at the 5′ end of transcripts across eukaryotes and archaea . Due to the smaller size of archaeal nucleosome DNA , the occupancy has a shorter periodicity . Figure adapted with permission from Chang et al . ( 2012 ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 00078 . 006 Our study demonstrates that both histones and chromatin architecture arose before the divergence of Archaea and Eukarya , suggesting that the fundamental role of chromatin in the regulation of gene expression is ancient . As well , owing to the small bacterial-sized archaeal genome , we suggest that archaeal chromatin is not required for genome compaction . This leads us to postulate that higher-order chromatin ( Sajan and Hawkins , 2012 ) is a eukaryotic invention and that archaeal chromatin is necessary but not sufficient for genome compaction . Additionally our observations provide a rich dataset that addresses the evolution of chromatin and its fundamental role in the regulation of gene expression . 4 Materials and methods Haloferax volcanii DS2 cells ( obtained from the ATCC ) were grown to mid-log phase at 42°C in ATCC 974 Halobacterium medium containing 2 M NaCl . Cells were fixed with 2% formaldehyde for 30 min then quenched with 125 mM of glycine for 5 min . An unfixed control sample was also prepared to serve as a deproteinized , ‘naked’ DNA control , as described previously ( Chung et al . , 2010 ) . Cells were pelleted and snap frozen prior to MNase digestion and DNA extraction . Frozen cells were processed according to a modified protocol from Rizzo et al . ( 2011 ) and Tsui et al . ( 2012 ) . Samples were digested with increasing concentrations of MNase and a no MNase control . After digestion , fragments 50–60 bp in length were size-selected using an Agilent Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity chip ( Agilent , Santa Clara , CA , part# 5067-4626 ) and further processed for Illumina deep sequencing . Nucleosomal and genomic libraries were pooled equally according to qPCR quantitation , and sequenced using v3 chemistry on one single-read HiSeq2000 lane ( 50 × 8 ) . Samples were demultiplexed using an 8-bp index read at the end of read 1 . Illumina sequencers require the ligation of an adapter oligonucleotide to facilitate cluster formation on the flow cell . Because the library inserts were short ( ∼60 bp ) , many sequence reads extended into the Illumina adapter sequences . The adapter subsequences were computationally trimmed to ensure maximal read mapping . Then , using a sequence quality cutoff of Phred20 , reads were trimmed from both 5′ and 3′ ends to ensure accurate mapping . These trimmed reads from control and MNase-treated genomic DNA were aligned to the Hfx . volcanii DS2 genome using the Bowtie 2 gapped short read aligner ( Langmead and Salzberg , 2012 ) . Sequence coverage was computed using the Genome Analysis Toolkit ( GATK ) depth of coverage walker , which revealed the periodicity in the occupancy data ( DePristo et al . , 2011 ) . To detect nucleosome midpoint positions , sequence data were Gaussian-smoothed as described previously by Shivaswamy et al . ( 2008 ) and Kaplan et al . ( 2009 ) . This is appropriate because signals generated by processes that are random , such as sequence coverage noise , usually have a probability density function defined by a Gaussian distribution ( Smith , 1997 ) . The Gaussian filter was defined as:G ( x ) =12πσe ( − ( x−μ ) 22σ2 ) , where μ is the mean of the distribution and σ is the standard deviation . A symmetrical convolution sum was applied with the following format:y[i]=∑j=−M2M2h[j]×x[i−j] , where M is an integer bandwidth , y[j] is the output , x[j] is the input and h[j] is an M-point function . So , to smooth the coverage data , we applied the following convolution sum:y[i]=∑j=−M2M2G[j]×x[i−j] , where σ=M6 . The interval length M is constrained to 6σ because this encompasses 99 . 75% of the Gaussian ( Smith , 1997 ) . We also optimized nucleosome midpoint detection by convoluting a two-pass simple moving average ( SMA ) filter , but the Gaussian filter detected midpoints with greater resolution . Optimal interval size for the Gaussian convolution sum , as determined by Pearson's correlation coefficient with the raw data , was 27 bp . For the two-pass SMA it was 40 bp for first-pass and 15 bp for second-pass . Nucleosome occupancy was normalized genome-wide by transforming sequence coverage data into binary-like data that existed in states of ‘occupied’ , ‘depleted’ or transitioning between those two states . This final occupancy map was used to define nucleosome positions . Nucleosome occupancy profiles were clustered hierarchically by average linkage using Pearson's correlation coefficient as the similarity metric in the Cluster 3 . 0 software package . Clusters were visualized with Java Treeview ( Figure 2B ) . RNA was extracted with Trizol reagent ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , 15596-026 ) , and DNase treated ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , AM1907 ) according to manufacturer specifications . A cDNA library was generated using 100 ng of total RNA according to Illumina TruSeq RNA Sample Prep protocol ( Illumina , RS-122-2001 ) prior to duplex-specific nuclease ( DSN ) treatment . 100 ng of cDNA library was incubated in hybridization buffer ( 50 mM HEPES , 500 mM NaCl ) for 2 min at 98°C , followed by 1 hr at 68°C . Ribosomal RNA ( rRNA ) was not specifically depleted ( He et al . , 2010 ) . Instead , we used duplex-specific nuclease ( DSN ) normalization to remove abundant RNA ( rRNA , tRNA ) from the total RNA sample , thereby enriching mRNA ( Zhulidov et al . , 2004 ) . Samples were immediately treated with 4 units of DSN enzyme ( Evrogen , Moscow , Russia EA001 ) in 1× DSN buffer and incubated for an additional 25 min at 68°C , prior to addition of stop solution , and purification with Ampure XP beads ( Beckman Coulter , Brea , CA , A63881 ) . RNA libraries were pooled equally according to qPCR quantitation , and sequenced using v3 chemistry on a paired-end single HiSeq2000 lane ( 100 × 8 × 100 ) . Samples were demultiplexed using an 8-bp index read at the end of read 1 . Total RNA was sequenced at extremely high coverage ( 2587 × mean coverage ) so that rRNA sequences ( ∼77% of all sequence reads ) could be computationally excluded , as described by Wurtzel et al . ( 2010 ) . After quality score trimming ( described earlier ) , sequence reads were aligned using TopHat ( Trapnell et al . , 2009 ) . The RNA-seq data displayed a great deal of overlap with the predicted annotations ( Hartman et al . , 2010 ) , with 92 . 1% of the existing annotations being confirmed . Of the 4073 predicted annotations , 3751 were confirmed , and , of these , 744 were merged with other transcripts to form longer transcripts . A heuristic approach was applied to adjust the transcript 5′ and 3′ positions of the Hartman et al . ( 2010 ) predicted annotations based on the boundaries of high RNA-seq coverage regions . This was vital as TSS accuracy is of great importance for NDR identification ( Figure 5 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 00078 . 007Figure 5 . Sample screenshot of all data tracks loaded into the Savant genome browser ( Fiume et al . , 2010 ) . The nucleosome sequence data is displayed , and the periodicity reflects protected and unprotected fragments after MNase digestion ( magnitude of peak is not considered ) . Peaks represent nucleosome midpoints , which were detected and marked . Below are the corresponding RNA-seq and curated gene tracks . In this screenshot , one can observe seven entire ORFs in line with their NDRs and –1 and +1 nucleosomes . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 00078 . 007 Because 85% of the Haloferax genome is predicted to be coding ( Hartman et al . , 2010 ) , transcript detection is complicated by transcript overlap . To overcome this , computationally identified transcripts were manually curated yielding a total of 3059 expressed transcripts in Hfx . volcanii . Of these , 32 transcripts are novel ( Supplementary file 1 ) . Of these transcripts , NTRANS_0004 was the most abundant transcript in the transcriptome , excluding the six rRNA genes . Homology data was obtained using BLASTX with a BLOSUM45 matrix against the non-redundant protein sequence database ( Altschul et al . , 1990 ) . Conserved domains were identified using the Conserved Domain Database ( Marchler-Bauer et al . , 2011 ) . Sequence data , nucleosome and transcriptome maps and supplemental tables have been deposited to the Short Read Archive and Dryad , as indicated in the datasets statement .

{"doi": "elife-17331-v1", "abstract": "The study of decision-making has mainly focused on isolated decisions where choices are associated with motor actions . However , problem-solving often involves considering a hierarchy of sub-decisions . In a recent study ( Lorteije et al . 2015 ) , we reported behavioral and neuronal evidence for hierarchical decision making in a task with a small decision tree . We observed a first phase of parallel evidence integration for multiple sub-decisions , followed by a phase in which the overall strategy formed . It has been suggested that a 'flat' competition between the ultimate motor actions might also explain these results .

We also examined the time-course of decision making in other , related tasks and report conditions where evidence integration for successive decisions is decoupled , which excludes flat models . We conclude that the flexibility of decision-making implies that the strategies are genuinely hierarchical .", "plain language summary": "Should you go for coffee with Jules , or go to the movie theater with Jim ? Both options require you to make additional decisions , for example , which café would you go to , or what movie could you see ? Many of the decisions we make in our daily lives feature a number of sub-decisions . Many of our day-to-day decisions have multiple layers of sub-decisions embedded within them that are not necessarily independent . Our opinions of the cafés in town and the movies showing at the theater may influence our decision over whom to spend the afternoon with . In 2015 , researchers at the Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience performed experiments in macaques to try to work out how the brain makes these decisions . The monkeys learned to choose between two visual stimuli ( decision 1 ) . The outcome of decision 1 determined whether the animals then had to make decision 2 or decision 3 . The results suggested that the monkeys initially made all three comparisons independently and in parallel , before combining the evidence to select their overall strategy . This process is referred to as hierarchical decision-making . In the original analogy , one would compare the relative merits of Jules versus Jim , café A versus café B , and a horror movie versus a comedy at the same time before deciding what to do . Other researchers have now reanalyzed the data from the original work using new computer simulations . This second analysis suggests that the results are more consistent with an alternative model of decision-making called a flat model , in which the brain compares all of the final options simultaneously ( Jules + café A; Jules + café B; Jim + horror movie; Jim + comedy ) before making a decision . In response to these findings , Zylberberg et al . – who conducted the work reported in 2015 – reanalyzed the original data and re-ran the simulations . Zylberberg et al . argue that the flat model provides a poor fit to the original data . A new experiment with human volunteers suggests that modifying the task by adding even more decisions can lead to the different comparisons being made one after the other ( in series ) rather than all at the same time ( in parallel ) , before the decision is made . This is difficult to explain with a flat model . Zylberberg et al . argue that these findings confirm the original conclusion that the monkeys use a hierarchical strategy . Moreover , the new results expose a previously unknown limit in the number of decisions that the brain can evaluate at any one time . If this limit is exceeded , decision-making becomes serial . Future studies can build on these findings by further exploring the limits of parallel decision-making , which may help us to understand how the brain is able to make multiple decisions while keeping the future consequences in mind .", "article": "1 Introduction The main aim of Lorteije et al . ( 2015 ) was to examine the neuronal correlates of hierarchical decision-making in the visual cortex . We trained monkeys to navigate through a decision tree with stochastic sensory evidence at branching points at two hierarchical levels , L1 and L2 ( Figure 2 of Lorteije et al . , [2015] ) . We measured the psychophysical kernels ( Ahumada , 1996 ) , which reflect the contribution of sensory information at different time-points to the decisions and recorded neuronal activity in visual cortical areas V1 and V4 . There are various strategies for solving this task . A decision maker could adopt a serial strategy , mentally tracing the curve from the fixation point and making a decision at each bifurcation until reaching one of the targets . Alternatively , evidence for the decisions could be integrated in parallel . In that case , the task might be represented as a ‘flat’ competition between four alternatives , or multiple decisions might first be considered independently before they are integrated to form a strategy . These models have been explored by Lorteije et al . ( 2015 ) and were reanalyzed in a companion paper by Hyafil and Moreno-Bote ( H and M ) ( Hyafil and Moreno-Bote , 2017 ) . The data of Lorteije et al . ( 2015 ) ruled out serial strategies , which wrongly predict that the psychophysical kernel for the L2 ( level 2 ) decision should be protracted relative to L1 and that evidence integration for L1 ( level 1 ) precedes evidence integration for L2 . Lorteije et al . ( 2015 ) also presented evidence against ‘flat’ models with a single accumulator per motor action , which predict that L1 difficulty should affect L2 accuracy . When the L1 decision is easy , strong evidence for L1 causes the decision variable to be close to the bound so that less evidence is required to make the L2 decision . We confirmed this intuition by fitting a simple ( 3-parameters ) instantiation of a ‘flat’ model to the behavioral data . As in most models of sensory decision making ( Smith and Ratcliff , 2004; Gold and Shadlen , 2007 ) —but contrary to the model by H and M—we assumed that the evidence is integrated without self-excitation ( or leak ) until reaching a criterion or bound . The model fits revealed that the decision-termination bound was low , which led to short integration times . This observation was supported by a model-free analysis of the psychophysical kernels , showing that the monkey’s choices were mainly influenced by the earliest luminance samples . Later samples made only a small contribution to the decision even though the monkeys had to wait at least 500 ms before they could report their decision . Unlike the monkeys , our instantiation of the flat model exhibited an influence of L1 difficulty on L2 accuracy , which led us to reject the flat model . H and M challenge our conclusion about flat models ( Hyafil and Moreno-Bote , 2017 ) , putting forward an 8-parameter version of the leaky-competing accumulator model ( LCA [Usher and McClelland , 2001; Tsetsos et al . , 2012] ) , which at first sight captures many aspects of the monkeys’ behavior . We therefore consider this model an interesting addition to the literature on the neural mechanisms for hierarchical decision-making . In H and M’s model , the task is represented as a flat competition between the four possible motor actions . Each alternative ( i ) integrates evidence simultaneously from L1 and L2 , ( ii ) is endowed with self-excitation , establishing a positive feedback loop , and ( iii ) is inhibited by a global process that affects all races equally . Here , we will first examine the manner in which H and M avoided the influence of L1 difficulty on L2 accuracy and conclude that it is neither compatible with the behavioral data nor with the neurophysiological data . We then examine more general properties of flat models and conclude that they lack the flexibility to account for decision making in hierarchical tasks . H and M’s model reduced the influence of L1 difficulty on L2 accuracy by implementing high bounds , strong recurrent excitation and sensory noise that does not scale with the strength of the evidence . Self-excitation was needed in H and M’s model to explain why the monkeys assigned high weights to the early samples in our task . Without self-excitation , models with high bounds produce flat psychophysical kernels , because they assign equal weights to many samples before committing to a choice ( Brunton et al . , 2013 ) . Unfortunately , the self-excitation in the model of H and M causes unstable activity . This can be seen in H and M’s Figure 3C where activity appears to follow an exponential time-course , which is incompatible with the findings of Lorteije et al . ( 2015 ) and other neurophysiological results ( e . g . Kiani et al . , 2008 ) . One possibility to stabilize the firing rates in H and M’s model would be to use an attractor network ( Wang , 2002; Wong and Wang , 2006 ) . However , attractors act as bounds and would increase the dependency of L2 accuracy on L1 difficulty . Furthermore , in primates and rodents evidence accumulation can occur without loss of information about the later samples ( Kira et al . , 2015; Kiani et al . , 2013; Brunton et al . , 2013 ) , which is incompatible with strong self-excitation . We simulated the two models proposed by H and M and observed that the high bounds combined with self-excitation did not suffice to prevent the interaction between L1 and L2 . The first model had infinite bounds collapsing after 500 ms , and the second one had high constant bounds , which were not reached on a large fraction of trials ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . We investigated whether the accuracy of the L2 decision depended on the accuracy of the L1 choice . In both models , L2 decisions were less accurate if the L1 decision was correct than if it was erroneous . This decrease in accuracy is visible as a flattening of the psychometric functions ( Figure 1 ) . We reanalyzed the data of Lorteije et al . ( 2015 ) and observed much weaker interactions between the two decisions ( Figure 1 ) . Relaxing some of H and M’s assumptions ( e . g . including noise that scales with the strength of the evidence [Zylberberg et al . , 2016] ) caused even stronger crosstalk . 10 . 7554/eLife . 17331 . 003Figure 1 .

The monkeys’ response times ( white bars ) exhibit a substantial increase with the difficulty of the stimulus , as expected from a decision process in which evidence is accumulated to a bound ( see also Figure S1D in Lorteije et al . , 2015 ) . The model of Hyafil and Moreno-Bote with stable high bounds produces unrealistically long response times ( black bars ) and the decision variable does not reach the bound in a large fraction of the trials . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 17331 . 004 We conclude that the models of H and M fail to account for the behavioral data . We next reanalyzed our neurophysiological data to test H and M’s model more directly . Specifically , the authors stated that the model predicts that ‘selection signals at levels two are only influenced by information provided at level two branches […] and not by information provided at level 1’ . To test this prediction , we grouped the trials into four categories based on the strength of evidence at L1 and examined the activity elicited by L2 branches in V4 ( Figure 2A ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 17331 . 005Figure 2 . Influence of strength of evidence at L1 on V4 activity elicited by the L2 and L2’ branches in V4 and in the model of H and M . ( A ) In the data , high L1 signal strength increases the representation of TT , suppresses the representations of DT and DD , but has little impact on TD . This finding is incompatible with flat models that include only one source of inhibition . ( B ) Upper panel , Same analysis conducted for the activity in the model of H and M . Note the steep rise in activity , which is very different from the neuronal activity in area V4 . High L1 signal strength increased activity elicited by both TT and TD , and suppressed DT and DD . Because of the rectification ( firing rates cannot take negative values ) , L1 evidence has the weakest influence on the DD branch . Lower panels , same data after the average activity was subtracted . Both models by H and M yielded similar results . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 17331 . 005 Our V4 recordings revealed that trials with strong evidence at L1 boosted the representation of the TT branch , suppressed the representation of the DT and DD branches ( linear regression , all Ps < 10−3 ) , but left activity elicited by the TD branch relatively unaffected ( p>0 . 3 ) ( Figure 2A ) . These distinct effects of L1 evidence on the four L2-branches are incompatible with any model in which the interactions between decisions are governed by a single source of inhibition , including the one by H and M . Indeed , when we conducted the same analysis in H and M’s model , we observed that stronger L1 evidence decreased the activity for the DT and DD branches and increased the activity for both the TT and TD branches ( Figure 2B ) . A possible explanation for the difference in activity elicited by the TD branch , which is suppressed in H and M’s model but not in the data , is that it was already suppressed by the selection of the TT branch . These more complex and local interactions between the L1 and L2 decisions are consistent with a genuine hierarchical decision making process and are incompatible with flat models with a single source of inhibition . 10 . 7554/eLife . 17331 . 006Figure 3 . Curve-tracing task with possible intersections . V1 activity elicited by a target curve was stronger than that elicited by a distractor curve . The latency of this enhanced activity reveals a serial decision process , as the selection signal of neurons with a receptive field near the fixation point ( close RF , L1-decision ) preceded the selection signal of neurons with a receptive field beyond the crossing ( far RF , L2-decision ) . The lower panels on the right represent the selection signals ( target minus distractor response ) . Reprinted with permission from Pooresmaeili and Roelfsema ( 2014 ) 18 . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 17331 . 006 Hyafil and Moreno-Bote criticized Lorteije et al . ( 2015 ) by stating that ad-hoc assumptions need to be made to explain the interactions between local selection signals in a hierarchical model . Indeed , hierarchical models imply that there are mechanisms to enable interactions between the different decisions . For example , Lorteije et al . ( 2015 ) demonstrated that the relative difficulty of the L2 decisions biases the L1 choice , an effect that is not only visible in the animals’ behavior but also in the modulation of firing rates in visual cortex . Because H and M’s global inhibitory process is refuted by the data , it follows that another mechanism should play an equivalent role . It is conceivable , for example , that there is a process that compares the confidence in the two L2 decisions and then biases the L1 decision . Lorteije et al . ( 2015 ) implemented a simple version of this mechanism where the confidence in the two L2-decisions was evaluated to select the target that maximizes reward . Such a role of confidence is supported by previous studies demonstrating that the confidence in one decision can guide another one ( Kepecs et al . , 2008; van den Berg et al . , 2016; Kiani and Shadlen , 2009 ) . We believe that elucidating the interactions between local selection signals is an important topic for future research . Importantly , these interactions between local selection signals do not provide evidence in favor of or against flat models . They are equally compatible with hierarchical models . H and M also claim that their two models are more parsimonious than the models in Lorteije et al . ( 2015 ) . We disagree with this parsimony claim . The models proposed by H and M contain a large number of parameters and have the same shortcomings as the simpler flat model that was explored in Lorteije et al . ( 2015 ) . We are also concerned that the results by H and M critically depend on ( 1 ) infinite bounds that collapse rapidly , which have not been observed in neurophysiology , ( 2 ) noise that does not scale with the strength of the evidence , and ( 3 ) strong self-excitation that causes a suboptimal decision making process and exponentially-increasing firing rates . More importantly , when testing the models by H and M , we found that they cannot explain the lack of an influence of L2 accuracy on L1 sensitivity , nor the absence of an influence of L1 luminance strength on the TD branch , and as such they fail to account for the behavioral and neurophysiological results in the hierarchical decision making task of Lorteije et al . ( 2015 ) . We will now turn to a more general problem that flat models incur when they are applied to hierarchical decision-making tasks . Flat models make all local decisions at the same time , because there is a single bound that governs them all . In contrast , previous curve-tracing studies presented evidence for serial decision making and we will here illustrate that shifts between parallel and serial strategies can occur . Indeed , under many conditions , curve-tracing invokes a serial operation , which is implemented in the visual cortex by the propagation of enhanced neuronal activity along a target curve ( Pooresmaeili and Roelfsema , 2014 ) . This propagation of enhanced neuronal activity has a correlate in psychology: observers gradually spread object-based attention over the relevant curve ( Houtkamp et al . , 2003 ) . In one previous study ( Pooresmaeili and Roelfsema , 2014 ) monkeys had to mentally trace a target curve that was connected to a fixation point ( Figure 3 ) . The target curve either crossed with a distractor curve or the curves did not intersect . We found that neuronal activity elicited in V1 by L1-segments of the target curve near the fixation point was enhanced before the activity elicited by the L2-segments beyond the location of the possible crossing . Thus , the enhanced V1 activity first reflects the L1-decision about the connection at the fixation point and only later reflects the L2-decision about the crossing . This result refutes flat models that implement a race between the four possible interpretations of the stimulus ( i . e . one accumulator for each of the four configurations on the left of Figure 3 ) . Why is hierarchical decision-making parallel in some situations ( Lorteije et al . , 2015 ) and serial in others ( Figure 3 ) ? Multiple factors may be at play . The first factor is the configuration of the stimulus . The crossings in the stimulus of Figure 3 do not provide independent evidence about the target or distractor status of the L2 branches ( the problem has an ‘exclusive-or’ structure ) , whereas in the task of Lorteije et al . ( 2015 ) local evidence at L2 permitted discarding branches as distractors before the L1 decision was taken . A second factor that may influence the degree of seriality is the number of decisions that have to be taken at the same time . We examined this possibility in a new experiment , which tested the capacity of parallel decision-making in human observers . We inferred the time-course of evidence accumulation by adding stochastic luminance evidence to branching points so that we could estimate the subjects’ psychophysical kernels , similarly to Lorteije et al . ( 2015 ) . Figure 4a illustrates our findings with a hierarchical decision-making task with two levels . At the L1-decision , subjects had to determine which branch connected to the fixation point ( left or right ) had the brightest image elements and they made a second decision ( highest luminance up or down ) at the relevant L2 branching point . Evidence for these decisions accumulated largely in parallel , just as in Lorteije et al . ( 2015 ) . However , the decision-making process switched to a more serial mode when we added a third level ( L3 ) so that the total number of decisions increased to seven ( Figure 4b ) . Now most of the evidence for L1 accumulated before the evidence for L2 , which , in turn accumulated mostly before the evidence for L3 . The implication is that there is a limited capacity for making decisions in this task . Subjects can accumulate evidence for between 3 and 7 decisions in parallel , although the exact capacity for parallel decision making remains to be determined . These results also imply that there are conditions under which evidence for L1 and L2 can accumulate independently . It is therefore parsimonious to assume that these separate accumulators also contribute to the task with only two decisions , in accordance with a genuine hierarchical decision making process . Thus , flat models can also not account for results in tasks that are intimately related to the task studied by Lorteije et al . ( 2015 ) . Furthermore , flat models need to reserve a single accumulator for every configuration of successive decisions ( e . g . eight accumulators for the task of Figure 4b ) , causing them to scale badly if decision trees become elaborate . 10 . 7554/eLife . 17331 . 007Figure 4 . Integrating evidence in a hierarchical decision making task with two ( a ) and three levels ( b ) . ( a ) Left , at every bifurcation , subjects had to choose the branch with the higher luminance . At L1 they chose left/right and at L2 they chose up/down . Right , the psychophysical kernel for L1 ( red ) and L2 ( blue ) , which represents the influence of luminance fluctuations at different time points aligned to the second response . ( b ) Adding a L3 decision caused a more serial decision process and decreased the overlap between the kernels for the L1 and L2 decisions . Panel b was reproduced with permission from Zylberberg et al . ( 2012 ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 17331 . 007 A third factor that can influence the seriality of decision making is practice . Prolonged training on a fixed set of problems is likely to result in more efficient decision making process , where multiple sources of evidence are efficiently considered and combined to form a strategy . We note , however , that the subjects of the tasks of Figures 3 and 4b performed many thousands of trials but that their decision-making process remained serial . These results , taken together , indicate that hierarchical decision-making is a highly flexible process during which evidence can be integrated by separate accumulators , allowing subjects to adapt their strategy to the task at hand . Parallel accumulation can only occur if it is permitted by the structure of the task ( i . e . if it does not have the exclusive-or structure ) and if the subject’s capacity for parallel decision making is not exceeded . Flat models lack the required flexibility . We conclude that critical predictions of the models of Hyafil and Moreno-Bote are not supported by the data and , more generally , that flat models fail to account for any situation where decision making is serial ( Figure 3 ) . Our finding in humans that adding L3 branches increases seriality at L1 and L2 ( Figure 4 ) implies that the machinery to take independent decisions at L1 and L2 is always in place . To further elucidate the neuronal mechanisms for hierarchical decision making , future studies could record from neurons with persistent activity , in areas like LIP or FEF , using variants of the task studied by Lorteije et al . They could also focus on the neuronal mechanisms that improve the interactions between successive decisions when subjects become proficient in a task . 2 Materials and methods All experimental procedures complied with the National Institutes of Health Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals , and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences . Detailed methods can be found in the original publication ( Lorteije et al . , 2015 ) . Briefly , multi-unit activity was collected from multi-channel electrode arrays implanted in the visual cortex ( area V1 and V4 ) of 2 monkeys , while these animals performed a hierarchical curve tracing task . For the analysis in Figure 2A , we grouped trials in quartiles of L1-evidence strength . For each trial , we averaged the luminance of the target and distractor segments at L1 over the first two samples , and then computed the difference . We then classified trials into quartiles , including only correct trials , independently for each of the three difficulty levels . Figure 2 shows the average firing rate ( normalized as in Lorteije et al . , 2015 ) within each quartile for receptive fields located at different branches . The averages are from 31 sites , and they were obtained in a total of 19 recording sessions . The three-level task displayed in Figure 4 was reproduced from Zylberberg et al . ( 2012 ) . The data from the two-level hierarchical task has not been published before . Three subjects had to trace a curve that bifurcated twice , completing between 1825 and 2534 trials each . Subjects had to make a left/right decision at L1 , and an up/down decision at L2 , reporting their decisions with different key-presses . As in Zylberberg et al . ( 2012 ) , luminance samples were perturbed with additive Gaussian noise ( σ = 10 cd/m2 ) , the background luminance was 50 cd/m2 and the mean luminance of the target was adjusted online with a Quest procedure to keep performance at ~75% correct . The psychophysical reverse correlation analysis was conducted as explained in the Supplemental Information of Zylberberg et al . ( 2012 ) ."}

Italian archaeologist Virginia Chiappella published the first studies; she documented bones from an extinct cave bear , human and animal footprints , charcoal from torches , finger marks , and lumps of clay stuck on the walls . Since then , many more archeologists and anthropologists have studied the cave and its fossils . Yet there are still lessons to be learned from this prehistoric site . Now , Romano et al . have combined a number of different approaches and used some of the latest technology and cutting-edge software to analyze 180 footprints and other tracks found in the cave . These trace fossils date to about 14 , 000 years ago , and the analysis revealed that they were left by a group of Stone Age humans who descended at least 400 meters into the cave . The group consisted of two adults , an adolescent and two children of about three and six years old . At one point they had to crawl through a low tunnel – something that has not previously been documented in the fossil record . The group were all barefoot , had no clothing on their arms and legs and used wooden torches to light the way . Together , these findings suggest that young children were active group members during the late Stone Age , even when carrying out apparently dangerous activities . Romano et al . now hope that their multidisciplinary approach may help other scientists looking to understand how humans behaved elsewhere in the world at various points in history .", "article": "1 Introduction A total of 180 footprints and traces sensu lato were recorded and studied ( Supplementary file 1 ) . In addition to footprints ( Figure 2 ) , among the traces are digit and handprints on the clay-rich floor , and smears from hands dirtied with charcoal on the side walls of the cave ( Figure 3 ) ( Giannotti , 2008 ) . A paleo-archaeological excavation was performed in 2016 in the ‘Sala dei Misteri’ . This survey highlighted the total absence of archaeological material but led to the recovery , on the trampled palaeosurface , of numerous charcoal remains with bundles of Pinus t . sylvestris/mugo originally used to illuminate the cave . New radiometric dating on these charcoal samples constrains the exploration of the cave to the late Upper Palaeolithic , between 12 , 310 ± 60 and 12 , 370 ± 60 BP , that is from about 14 , 700 to 14 , 000 cal BP ( Table 1 ) . Digit and hand traces are preserved in several sectors of the cave ( Figure 3 ) . Most are unintentional traces related to cave exploration activities ( Figure 3 , C0 , C26b , C72 ) . Others , especially in the inner chamber ( ‘Sala dei Misteri’ ) which are still being studied , are very probably related to social or symbolic activities and can be instead considered intentional ( Figure 3 , SM55 , SM56 ) . Moreover , different sized bear and Canidae incertae sedis footprints are ubiquitously present ( Figure 4 ) , and are often associated with human prints . The available data regarding the footprints attributed to ‘canids’ suggest a very reduced number of individuals and a close association with the human prints . Should ongoing studies ( Avanzini et al in prep . ) confirm that the ichnnological association of Bàsura could prove crucial to shed new light on dog domestication in the Upper Paleolithic ( Morey and Jeger , 2015; Perri , 2016; Lupo , 2017; Janssens et al . , 2018 ) . Ursus sp . hibernation areas are still recognizable with well-preserved nests of both cubs and adult bears . Footprints are preserved in several areas of the cave , particularly in the innermost chamber ( ‘Sala dei Misteri’ ) and in the main gallery ( ‘Corridoio delle impronte’ – Footprints Corridor ) , which is divided into two corridors at different elevations of about 5 m ( referred to as the lower and upper corridor , respectively ) ( Figure 1 ) . Flooding dynamics and cave geometry produced two different situations for sediment deposition and transport inside the cave . Detrital sediment comprising silty clay and well-sorted sandy sediment are most abundant on the floor of the ‘Sala dei Misteri’ . Coarse lithologies comprising gravel-sized and larger ( >2 mm ) grains include a few fragments of bear bones . The sandy fraction comprises allogenic , surface-derived siliciclastic sediment . The ‘Sala dei Misteri’ appears to have undergone episodic filling and erosion as a result of catastrophic storms . Sediment in the ‘Corridoio delle impronte’ comprises a large mud fraction and includes many coarse lithic fragments which are mainly carbonates ( calcite and dolomite ) , suggesting an autogenic origin . Here , the trampled substrate is poorly consolidated and superimposed on a stalagmite crust . At the time when humans and other large mammals left their traces the cave substrate differed in different areas of the cave . In some areas , the substrate was plastic and in other areas it was waterlogged or submerged . Differing moisture content of the substrate accounts for the variable preservation of detail of the tracks ( e . g . registration of plantar arch , heel and metatarsal regions , digit tips , track walls ) , particularly of the associated extra-morphologies ( e . g . expulsion rims , slipping traces ) . The surface of the substrate and the footprints are cross-cut by mud cracks , suggesting a loss of moisture in sediments after trampling . Carbonate crusts ( comprising both calcite and dolomite ) cover many of the footprints in areas subjected to more intense dripping . Iron and manganese oxide coatings were found in the crust , probably due to repeated immersion in ponded water . 2 Results Geometric morphometry performed on human footprints highlighted five main morphotypes ( hereafter Morphs . ) indicating a possible minimum number of five individuals entering the cave ( Figure 5 ) . This number is confirmed by the construction of morphological groups ( Table 2 ) reconstructed through the overlapping of footprints that show a variability of less than 2% of the main parameters . Morphs . 1 and 2 can be easily distinguished on the basis of the absolute footprint size . Morph . 1 includes footprints with a length of 13 . 55 ± 0 . 49 cm showing characters indicative of an early ontogenetic stage of the producer , such as digit traces and the heel area proportionally wider than those of the longer tracks . Morph . 2 , with a length of 17 cm , is distinguished from Morph . one on the basis of a more pronounced plantar arch . Morph . 3 comprises footprints 20 . 83 ± 0 . 51 cm in length ( Figure 5 and Table 3 ) . The plantar area is characterized by a very pronounced medial embayment . This corresponds with a strongly convex external margin , as is shared together with a strong adduction of digit I trace , an overall larger divarication of digit traces and a consistent separation between adjacent digits II-III and IV-V . Morph . 4 ( Figures 5 and 6 ) is represented by larger footprints ( 22 . 80 ± 0 , 42 cm in overall length ) with roughly straight medial and lateral margins and a medial embayment less marked than that of Morph . 3 . Digit tip traces are strongly aligned and oriented forward . Morph . 5 ( Figures 5 and 7 ) includes footprints of 25 . 73 ± 0 . 45 cm in overall length and slightly concave margins , with a variably pronounced plantar embayment . The footprints of Morph . 5 are generally more robust and stockier than those of Morphs . 3 and 4 , sharing with Morph . 4 the straight , forwardly oriented digit tips , and with Morph . 3 an adducted digit I trace . Plantigrade tracks enabled us to estimate stature , weight and ontogenetic stage of the producers based on biometric measurements ( Table 3 ) and the adopted formulas ( see Methods ) . An estimation of the gender for Morph . 5 was also attempted ( see Methods ) . The group of human track producers entering the cave comprised: a three-year-old child about 88 cm tall ( Morph . 1 ) ; a child at least 6 years old and about 110 cm tall ( Morph . 2 ) ; a pre-adolescent , between 8 and 11 years old , about 135 cm tall ( Morph . 3 ) ; a sub-adult to adult about 148 cm tall ( Morph . 4 ) ; and an adult about 167 cm tall ( Morph . 5 ) . Estimate of the stature for the Morph . 5 is further supported by the length of the tibia derived from the available kneeling traces ( see Methods ) . Our results concerning Morphs . 4 and 5 , which are referred to adult individuals , are in agreement with the average stature of European Upper Palaeolithic people ( 162 . 4 ± 4 . 6 cm for males and 153 . 9 ± 4 . 3 cm for females ) ( Villotte et al . , 2017 ) . Body mass estimates derived from footprint parameters suggests slender and muscular body proportions for all the trackmakers . Arch angle and footprint morphology suggests a male as the probable trackmaker of the largest footprint group . Differently , the gender result difficult to infer for morphotypes 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , although Morph . 4 can be referred most probably to a female . Digitigrade and semi-plantigrade footprints provide information on pedal postures and the behavior of the producers passing through different sub-environments of the cave . Both these footprint types were , in most cases , traced back to the same type of producer by comparison with complete footprints indicating complete foot support during locomotion . Some semi-plantigrade footprints ( e . g . Figure 8 , C44 , C44b ) show a strongly adducted trace of digit I and an apparent alignment with the other digits , probably because of the intra-rotation movements of the distal portion of the foot during the thrust phase . Footprints included in the Morph . 3 show a peculiar pedal morphology . While the resulting morphology of the digit I trace is explained by walking on a waterlogged substrate , the separation between digit pairs II-III and IV-V suggest an inherited familiar trait or a pathological condition of the producer’s feet . The producer was not incapacitated , showing the greatest mobility in the hypogeal environment . In the lower corridor ( Figure 9 ) , a few of these footprints are associated with elongated traces imprinted by the producers’ knees resting on the substrate . Successions of kneeling traces can be clearly recognized for Morphs . 3 , 4 , and 5 . Based on the overall size of the metatarsal and knee couples aligned on the substrate , crawling in a totally unknown environment is inferred for the whole group . These knee imprints ( e . g . Figure 8 , C42 ) show the muscle structure of the knee joint and adjacent regions . The patella , the patellar ligament ( tendon ) , the tibial tuberosity , the fibular head , the basis of the vastus medial and the iliotibial band are recognizable and allow us to infer the body structure of the trackmakers . 3 Discussion A holistic analysis comprising several lines of inter-related ichnological evidence enabled reconstruction of several snapshots depicting a small and heterogeneous group of Upper Palaeolithic people that explored a cave about 14 , 000 years ago ( Video 1 ) . They traversed the uneven topography of the cave floor and carried out social activities in the most remote room , leaving evidence in their traces of a unique testimony to human curiosity . The lower corridor was traversed on entry into the cave and documents the first unequivocal evidence of crawling locomotion in the human ichnological record . This mode of locomotion was adopted by the explorers to obviate variation in the height of the cave roof . As no outgoing footprints were documented in the lower corridor it appears that the group chose to exit through the upper corridor , as the cave roof is higher and the substrate firmer . An additional reason for choosing this path of exit could have been the exploratory and curiosity factor to follow a different and unexplored path to reach the cave exit . Anatomical features clearly registered on the substrate indicate that the lower limbs of the individuals were not covered with clothing . Our study also confirms that very young children actively participated in the activities of the Upper Palaeolithic populations , even in seemingly dangerous tasks , such as the deep exploration of the cave environment lit only with torches . As recently suggested for other European caves ( Pastoors et al . , 2015; Pastoors et al . , 2017; Ledoux et al . , 2017 ) the ‘Grotta della Bàsura’ site strongly supports the hypothesis that the cave exploration in Upper Paleolithic was carried out by groups of heterogeneous age and gender . The Epigravettian necropolis of the Arene Candide Cave ( AMS dates spanning 12 , 820–12 , 420 cal BP for the first phase and 12 , 030–11 , 180 cal BP for the second phase ) , consisted of a ‘mixed’ sample of people ( males , females , adults , children ) and suggests an Upper Palaeolithic people composition very similar to that highlighted in the ‘Grotta della Bàsura’ ( Riel-Salvatore et al . , 2018; Sparacello et al . , 2018 ) . The burial of a newborn infant , together with grave goods , recently discovered in the Arma di Veirana cave ( Erli , Savona , Liguria ) situated in a valley 10 km from the coast , further indicates that women and children systematically followed the movements of the group in the territory ( F . N . pers . obs . ) ( Negrino et al . , 2017 ) and shared , at least in part , the activities of men and had similar personal adornment . The tracks left in the Bàsura indicate that the behavior of hunter-gatherers was not always driven by subsistence requirements , but as manifested by many ethnographic examples , also by fun and frivolous activities . 4 Materials and methods Radiometric dating of charcoals previously established the presence of humans in the cave to the Upper Palaeolithic , around 12 , 340 ± 160 years BP ( De Lumley and Giacobini , 1985 ) . The stalagmite crust preserving the footprints and incorporating fragments of coal is dated to between 14 , 300 ± 800 and 13 , 100 ± 500 ( Yokoyama et al . , 1985 ) . The final phase of stalagmite growth , which closed the entrance and sealed the ‘time capsule’ , occurred at 12 , 000 ± 1100 ( Yokoyama et al . , 1985 ) . New radiometric dating of charcoal samples of Pinus t . sylvestris/mugo was undertaken in 2017 at a AMS facility at Groningen ( NL ) on ( Table 1 ) . Material was collected from the trampled palaeosurface during recent excavations inside the ‘Sala dei Misteri’ ( Figure 14 ) . Documentation of the sequence of events was contextualized and visualized on the rough cave topography through three-dimensional mapping of the cave performed by laser-scanning . The main landmarks of the cave were digitally recorded using the laser scanner ScanStation2 Leica and ScanStation C10 Leica . The scans were performed at 360° ( acquisition grid of the point cloud of 2 × 2 cm a probe 7 m and in correspondence to the areas with the highest concentration of traces , an acquisition grid of 0 . 5 × 0 . 5 cm probe 7 m ) . In total , 23 stations were run ( nine in the ‘Sala dei Misteri’ and 14 in the ‘Corridoio delle impronte’ areas ) ; 38 targets ( 16 in the ‘Sala dei misteri’ and 22 in the ‘Corridoio delle impronte’ ) were used for the point clouds registration . The Leica Geosystems HDS Cyclone 9 . 1 software was used to process the data . The recording shows a final alignment error of 2 mm for the model of the ‘Sala dei Misteri’ and 1 mm for the ‘Corridoio delle impronte’ ( Video 1 ) . From the models , reliefs were obtained at various degrees of detail that enabled georeferencing of all traces . The original cast performed in 1950 were digitally acquired via HDI Advance structured-light 3D Scanner R3x , with a resolution of 0 . 25 mm at 600 mm FOV ( field of view ) . The data were processed with FlexScan3D Software ( Figures 6 , 7 , 8d and 9d ) . Several photogrammetric models were obtained using several photos taken with 24 Megapixel Canon EOS 750D ( 18 mm focal length ) . The software used to build models is Agisoft PhotoScan Pro ( www . agisoft . com ) . High-resolution Digital Photogrammetry is based on Structure from Motion ( SfM ) ( Ullman , 1979 ) and Multi View Stereo ( MVS ) ( Seitz et al . , 2006 ) algorithms and produces high-quality dense point clouds . The accuracy of the obtained models is up to 1 mm for close-range photography . The reconstructed 3D surfaces were then processed in the open-source software Paraview . False colored models with contour lines , highlighting general morphology and differential depth of impression of the traces , were obtained ( Figures 9a , 12 and 13 ) . All recognized tracks ( 107 human traces ) were analyzed directly in the field through a morphological approach using available landmarks ( Robbins , 1985 ) . The differential depth of each individual impression was analyzed directly in the field to infer the complex and multiphase biomechanics . All isolated footprints , and those associated with trackways , were drawn in the field on plastic film . All morphological and dimensional data collected in the field were double-checked by using photos and photogrammetric models . In addition , the original casts of the footprints from the 1950s were also used and analyzed . Their positions in the cave were verified and it was established that all the footprints identified during the early explorations are still visible in situ ( Figure 1 , Table 4 ) . Some of them have suffered alteration and loss of detail and others have been partially damaged . For this reason , in some instances , we have integrated morphometric data of the in situ footprints with those of plaster casts . In addition , the following two indices were considered: Footprint index ( FI ) , equal to foot width/foot length x100 and Arch angle ( Aa ) , represented by the angle between the footprint medial border line and the line that connect the most medial point of the footprint metatarsal region and the apex of the concavity of the arch of the footprint ( Clarke , 1933 ) . In the reconstruction of body dimensions and age , only the foot measurements derived from the better-preserved footprints were used ( Table 3 ) . The 23 better preserved footprints were subjected to a Principal Component Analysis ( PCA ) using the software PAST 3 . 10 ( Hammer et al . , 2001 ) . Homologous points were selected on the footprints for the measurements ( Robbins , 1985 ) ( Figure 15 ) . These included nine anatomical lengths and widths ( foot lengths ( Dt1-BL , Dt2-BL , Dt3-BL ) ; ball medial length ( mtm-BL ) ; ball lateral length ( mtl-BL ) ; heel medial length ( ccm-BL ) ; heel lateral length ( ctul-BL ) ; widths of ball ( mtm-horiz . ) and heel ( ctul-horiz . ) ( Table 4 ) . The raw data were log-transformed before the analysis to fit linear models and for the correspondence of the log transform to an isometric null hypothesis ( Chinnery , 2004; Cheng et al . , 2009; Romano and Citton , 2015; Romano and Citton , 2017; Romano , 2017 ) . Missing entries were treated according to the ‘iterative imputation’ in PAST 3 . 10 , preferable to the simple ‘mean value imputation’ ( Hammer , 2013 ) . The results of the PCA are reported in the scatter plots of Figure 5a , whereas the loadings for the first three principal components are provided as supplementary information ( and Appendix 1 Tables A , B , Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) . It is possible to estimate stature from foot length ( Robbins , 1985; Oberoi et al . , 2006; Krishan and Sharma , 2007; Kanchan et al . , 2008; Pawar and Pawar , 2012 ) . Stature varies with race , age , sex , heredity , climate and nutritional status . Based on skeletal evidence , it is thought that the body proportions of terminal Upper Palaeolithic individuals was similar to that of modern humans ( Trinkaus , 1997; Ruff et al . , 2005; Shackelford , 2007 ) but the foot length/stature ratio was considered highly uncertain , between 0 . 15 and 0 . 16 . Consequently , we calculated the foot length/stature ratio based on a sample of terminal Upper Palaeolithic adult individuals ( n . 8 ) from the Italian Peninsula ( Corrain , 1977; Paoli et al . , 1980; Formicola et al . , 1990; Mallegni and Fabbri , 1995; Mallegni et al . , 2000 ) . The calculated ratio is found to be 0 . 1541 , which is close to those proposed for modern humans between the XIX and XX centuries ( Robbins , 1985; Topinard , 1878 ) . Stature estimation from the length of long bones is commonly used in forensic medicine . In this study , we used the percutaneous length of the tibia to check the stature of the Morph . 5 as this measurement is known to have a strong correlation with body height . We used the relation S = 101 . 85 + 1 . 81 x PCTL ±3 . 73 for male and S = 77 . 86 + 2 . 36 x PCTL ±2 . 94 for female ( where S = stature and PCTL = Percutaneous tibial length ) ( Lemtur et al . , 2017 ) . For a tibial length of 35 cm , the stature of Morph . 5 is 165 . 2 ± 3 . 73 cm , which is comparable to the stature assumed from foot length ( 166 . 99 ± 2 . 93 cm ) . Body mass estimates were derived from footprint parameters , based on the assumption that human body proportions have been constant through time ( Dingwall et al . , 2013 ) . Regression formulae are based on mature individuals ranging between 154 and 185 cm in stature ( weight Kg = 4 . 71 + ( 1 . 82xFL ) ) ( Dingwall et al . , 2013; Bavdekar et al . , 2006; Ashton et al . , 2014 ) or on children ( Grivas et al . , 2008 ) with an average height of 147 , 44 cm ( weigth Kg = −71 . 142 + ( 5 . 259xrigthFL ) . We have used these formulae for the individual taller than 147 cm ( Table 3 ) , stature: ( b ) ( Bavdekar et al . , 2006 ) , ( c ) ( Grivas et al . , 2008 ) . For the three smaller individuals , we used formulae based on extant Caucasian children between 6 and 11 years old ( n . 7147 ) ranging in stature between 118 . 6 and 145 . 7 cm ( Malina et al . , 1973 ) to develop a mathematical relation between foot length and body mass for young individuals . The report is nonlinear and expressed by the formula mass = 2 . 2897 e0 . 126FL ( Citton et al . , 2017 ) . No dataset are available for the smaller individual . We have therefore hypothesized the body mass of MP1 by the trend-line derived from previous formulae . Foot length varies according to age and gender . Studies on the relationship size/age of the foot in extant juvenile individuals ( Fryar et al . , 2012; Müller et al . , 2012 ) have highlighted that 1-year-old individuals have a foot length equal to 13 . 07 ± 1 . 59 cm , reaching 24 . 4 ± 2 . 96 cm at the age of 13 years . The age estimation based on growth curves built on extant populations is very similar . However , we must bear in mind that the reference anthropometric data mainly refer to modern well-nourished populations , with a body mass most likely higher at the same age . Anthropometric studies suggest that the morphology of the foot changes and becomes more elongated when the arch stabilizes around the age of six ( Müller et al . , 2012 ) . In extant human populations , from the fifth or sixth years of age , arch angles vary from 21° ( 3–4 years ) to 43° ( 9–11 years ) in young males , and from 26° ( 3–4 years ) to 47° ( 9–11 years ) in young females ( Forriol and Pascual , 1990 ) . As a result , morphotypes 2 and 3 seem to be similar , likely suggesting a corresponding similarity of age between producers of the two morphotypes . Growth curves based on extant populations with an average height similar of those of the Late Upper Paleolithic provided an estimate of the age of the trackmakers . For MP5 , the wide and stout morphology is here interpreted as an adult stage with the partial collapse of the plantar arch . Sex determination established from the foot has been proposed using Foot index and threshold values . However , this approach is not entirely accepted and some researchers pointed out that the threshold value could vary significantly between populations , thus making it very speculative that gender estimations could be determined from foot morphology ( Walia et al . , 2016 ) . These variations could be due to fact that anatomic structures of the foot manifest ethnic and regional variations owing to climatic factors , physical activities , socio-economic status and nutritional conditions . Despite the method , uncertain arch angle and footprint morphology suggests a possible male as trackmaker of the largest footprint group . No definitive gender can be inferred for Morphotypes 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ."}

Intensive and repetitive training is essential for musicians , athletes , or surgeons . It is also important for people undergoing rehabilitation to help them regain normal movements after an illness or injury . Although practice is said to make perfect , there comes the point when it also causes physical fatigue . Fatigue can impair how well a person performs a movement , but its effects on learning a task are less clear . Now , Branscheidt et al . show that being physically fatigued interferes with learning a new movement skill . In the experiments , volunteers were divided in two groups: the first group had to learn a new motor skill after their hand muscles were physically fatigued , the second group learned the same task without being worn out . The fatigued volunteers had a harder time learning a new motor task both on the day of the task and on the following days , even after they had recovered from the fatigue . The same experiment was repeated , but instead of learning a motor task , the volunteers were asked to learn a sequence of keystrokes . The volunteers in both groups learned this new thinking task easily . This suggests that learning new thinking tasks is not affected by physical fatigue . Branscheidt et al . also disrupted memory formation in part of the brain that controls movement after volunteers finished learning the motor task using a technique called repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation . This eliminated the motor learning deficit in the fatigued group . This may suggest that memories formed after fatigue may impair later motor learning and that physical training or rehabilitation that pushes people to work past fatigue may be counterproductive . Further study of these processes may help to develop better training regimens and rehabilitation methods .", "article": "1 Introduction We know from everyday life that , in order to gain and maintain proficiency , the most critical requirement in a motor skill is practice . Intensive , repetitive training is an essential routine for musicians , artists , surgeons , and athletes . Repetitive practice is also part of rehabilitation approaches to recover function of the motor system and other domains . While repetition improves performance over time , there comes the point when it also causes fatigue and eventual degradation of task execution ( Boyas and Guével , 2011; Gandevia et al . , 1995b ) . Studies investigating fatigue have made a distinction between fatigue as a cognitive phenomenon and fatigue as a neuromuscular phenomenon ( Janet , 2012 ) , although this separation can be blurred at times ( Kuppuswamy , 2017 ) . In neurological conditions , for instance , fatigue has been described as an overall state linked to changes in motor cortex excitability ( Kuppuswamy et al . , 2015 ) . Here , we use the term fatigue to describe the degradation of maximal force output induced through voluntary physical exertion of task-relevant muscles . Surprisingly little is known about the effects of muscle fatigue on the acquisition of motor skills . The existing literature regarding motor learning under fatigue is mostly limited to a few studies from the 1970–90 s with contradictory results ( for a comprehensive overview see Janet , 2012 ) . While some studies have reported that participants are unable to learn a motor task under fatigue conditions ( Carron and Ferchuk , 1971 , Thomas et al . , 1975 ) , others have not found fatigue to be detrimental to motor learning ( Cotten et al . , 1972 Alderman , 1965 , Spano and Burke , 1976 ) . One often overlooked key challenge in studying motor learning under fatigue is the so-termed ‘performance-learning’ distinction ( Cahill et al . , 2001; Kantak and Winstein , 2012 ) : Performance is usually defined as a temporary effect; for example , how skillful a movement is executed during one training session . In contrast , learning can only be inferred indirectly from performance , by measuring differences in performance over time or tasks ( Kantak and Winstein , 2012 ) . This distinction is essential because experimental conditions that affect performance do not necessarily have to affect learning . For example , while the performance of rats in the absence of a motivational cue seemed to show no learning in a maze task despite repeated practice , providing a food reward uncovered that they indeed had learned the right path nonetheless ( Tolman and Honzik , 1930 ) . Thus , it is necessary to separate decreased task performance under fatigue with true effects of fatigue on motor learning . Here , we address this issue by disentangling the effect of muscle fatigue on learning a motor skill from the performance confounder . In experiment 1 ( N = 38 ) , we asked healthy individuals to learn a sequential pinch force task over two days and showed that , even though participants were only fatigued at Day 1 , skill learning was impaired on both days . Interestingly , a subgroup of fatigued subjects ( N = 12 ) took two additional days of training with no fatigue to catch up to the skill performance level of the non-fatigued group . In experiment 2 ( N = 20 ) , we tested performance on the untrained , unfatigued hand and demonstrated that participants had impaired skill learning in both the fatigued and unfatigued effector . In experiment 3 ( N = 45 ) , we replicated the findings of experiment 1 and tested whether the negative effects of fatigue on learning are centrally mediated . We found that disruptive rTMS to the motor cortex ( Cantarero et al . , 2013a; Huang et al . , 2010 ) partly alleviates the adverse effects of fatigue on skill learning , suggesting a possible role for maladaptive memory formation under fatigued conditions . Finally , in Experiment 4 ( N = 18 ) , we investigated if the observed fatigue effects are domain-specific or also present in another task that is cognitive demanding but requires minimal force control . We found that muscle fatigue did not affect the learning of a ten-sequence element task on Day 1 or 2 . Altogether , our results provide the first evidence that motor fatigue has a domain-specific lasting adverse effect on skill learning . The findings are significant to professions that rely on intensive physical training to achieve optimal performance . Understanding the effects of fatigue on learning helps the formulation of training and rehabilitation regimens geared to improve motor function . 2 Results In the first experiment , we assessed how muscle fatigue influenced skill learning over multiple days . 38 participants trained in a force-control demanding , isometric pinch task for two days; see Figure 1 . While all subjects were instructed to perform an isometric pinch contraction prior to four bouts of training on Day 1 , a subset of participants ( Fatigue group ( FTG ) , N = 20 ) performed the contractions until experiencing muscle fatigue ( ~60% decrement of maximal voluntary contraction . MVC was measured in Newton and monitored by surface electromyographic ( EMG ) signal ) . A control group ( NoFTG , N = 18 ) contracted the same muscle group at ~5% of MVC over a matched period of time without experiencing force decline . On Day 2 both groups performed the skill task without the induction of fatigue . Skill learning was indexed by a measure that quantifies shifts in the relationship between movement time and accuracy rate ( Reis et al . , 2009 ) . As the relationship between learning rate and skill measure appeared linear , a regression line was fit separately for each day and group . Here the slope of the regression line represents the learning rate ( see Materials and methods ) . Fatigue was reliably induced during Day 1 in the fatigue group , as shown by decrements of MVC over time . Importantly , MVC always stayed above the force level required to execute the task ( up to 40% of MVC; see Appendix 1 ) . All participants improved their ability to execute the task on both days; see Figure 1 . However , on both days , learning rates for the FTG were significantly reduced when compared to the NoFTG ( Day 1: mean slopes NoFTG 0 . 169 versus FTG 0 . 038; p=0 . 01 . Day 2: mean slopes NoFTG 0 . 339 versus FTG 0 . 083; p=0 . 03; Figure 1 ) . It is important to note that the lower performance of the fatigued group on Day 1 does not allow to make a direct inference about lower motor learning ( e . g . , because of task differences ) . Nonetheless , on Day 2 the FTG did not even reach the same execution level the NoFTG subjects had at the end of Day 1 ( p=0 . 01 ) , despite having twice the amount of practice and not been fatigued ( i . e . they had similar MVC and were performing within the same force range ) . Of note , there were no changes in overall learning rate across days for either controls or the fatigued group ( Day one versus Day 2 NoFTG: p=0 . 21 , FTG: p=0 . 77 ) , indicating that learning rates remained low in the FTG . A separate analysis of the changes in movement time and percentage of correct trials showed that the effect of fatigue on skill performance was due to more errors in the FTG and not to differences in movement time . Counter-intuitively , this higher rate of errors was due to increased force production in the FTG resulting in target overshoot . This was most prominent for the two lower force targets while performance in the highest force target was similar between groups ( see Appendix 1 ) . To assess , how much practice the FTG took to reach similar performance levels as the NoFTG , a subgroup of participants continued training up to four days ( NoFTG4D N = 12 , FTG4D N = 12 ) . While Day 1 and two showed the same result with lower learning rates for the FTG4D ( Day 1: p<0 . 01; Day 2: p<0 . 01 ) , this group reached similar performance levels to the control group only towards the end of Day 3 and on Day 4 ( Day 3: p=0 . 07; Day 4: p=0 . 09; see Figure 2 ) . Since learning in the FTG was impaired even in the non-fatigued state on Day 2 , these results indicate that learning under fatigue conditions has a long-lasting detrimental effect on skill acquisition . Because execution under fatigue is impaired , it is conceivable that this performance confounder masked skill learning . Assessing the transfer of learning to the uninstructed , unfatigued hand provides a unique way to circumvent this challenge . Generalization of motor skills across hands has previously been well characterized , where skill training with one hand results in improved performance in the untrained hand ( Camus et al . , 2009; Perez et al . , 2007 ) . Thus , in experiment 2 , we measured skill execution in the left hand of a new group of 20 participants before and after training with their right fatigued ( FTGTRANSFER , N = 10 ) or non-fatigued hand ( NoFTGTRANSFER , N = 10 ) . Similar to experiment 1 , right hand learning rates over the four blocks were lower in participants that performed the task under fatigue compared to controls ( mean slope NoFTGTRANSFER 0 . 03 versus FTGTRANSFER 0 . 008; p=0 . 01; Figure 3 ) . As expected , prior to training , the skill measure of the left hand was similar between groups ( t18 = −0 . 157 , p=0 . 88 ) . After training with the right hand , performance of the left hand was significantly lower in the FTGTRANSFER compared to the NoFTGTRANSFER ( mean ∆block2-block1 NoFTGTRANSFER 0 . 133 ± 0 . 036 versus FTGTRANSFER 0 . 018 ± 0 . 003; p<0 . 01; Figure 3 ) . Based on the work of Tolman and Honzik ( Tolman and Honzik , 1930 ) differences in skill performance between the fatigued and the control groups could arise from impeded execution in the right hand , which could theoretically mask similar underlying learning rates in both groups . If this would be the case , then the unfatigued effector in both groups should show comparable skill levels . However , our results indicate that fatigue did indeed affect learning and that the performance confounder did not just mask the expression of learning . Importantly , the poor performance in the untrained hand suggests that fatigue impairs central motor-skill learning mechanisms beyond any potential adverse effect within the fatigued effector . To determine whether the effect of fatigue on learning is centrally mediated , we interfered with primary motor cortex processes thought to be involved in skill retention in a new group of participants ( Galea et al . , 2011; Muellbacher et al . , 2002; Reis et al . , 2009; Richardson et al . , 2006 ) . To this end , in experiment 3 we used disruptive rTMS ( repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ) over the primary motor cortex ( M1 ) after task training on Day 1 ( FTGM1 , N = 15 ) ( Cantarero et al . , 2013a; Huang et al . , 2010 ) . To control for potential non-specific effects of rTMS , we also tested a fatigued and a non-fatigued group with TMS applied over the parietal interhemispheric fissure ( Pz , according to 10–20 system; FTGSHAM , N = 15 and NoFTGSHAM , N = 10 ) . The permutation test showed that learning rates of both fatigued groups were smaller compared to controls , but similar to each other on Day 1 ( mean slope NoFTGSHAM 0 . 049 , FTGSHAM 0 . 02 , FTGM1 0 . 016; NoFTGSHAM versus FTGSHAM p=0 . 01 , NoFTGSHAM versus FTGM1 p<0 . 01 , FTGSHAM versus FTGM1 p=0 . 73; Figure 4 ) . On Day 2 , consistent with experiment 1 and 2 , the learning rate was still smaller in FTGSHAM compared to the NoFTGSHAM control . However , the learning rate of the FTGM1 group was not significantly different from the NoFTGSHAM , but significantly different from FTGSHAM ( mean slope NoFTGSHAM 0 . 04 , FTGSHAM 0 . 022 , FTGM1 0 . 042; NoFTGSHAM versus FTGSHAM p=0 . 04 , NoFTGSHAM versus FTGM1 p=0 . 47 , FTGSHAM versus FTGM1 p=0 . 03 ) . Of note , comparing learning rates across days within groups , we found a significant difference for FTGM1 ( Day one versus Day 2 , FTGM1 p=0 . 04 ) , but no difference for the other two groups ( Day 1 versus Day 2 , NoFTGSHAM p=0 . 94 , FTGSHAM p=0 . 88 ) . Together , these results show that disruption of M1 function after training diminished the detrimental effects of fatigue on motor-skill learning . This indicates that the long-lasting effects of fatigue on learning are at least partly centrally mediated and linked to motor memory formation . To determine whether the observed muscle fatigue effects are specific to tasks with high motor control demand ( e . g . , accurate force control to complete the sequence ) vs . a task with more cognitive demands , we performed an additional control . Here , 18 healthy participants performed a 10-element , finger sequence task by simply pressing the correct key on a computer keyboard after being fatigued ( FTGSEQUENCE , N = 9 ) or not ( NoFTGSEQUENCE , N = 9 ) as done in the prior experiments ( for visualization of the study design the Materials and methods and Appendix 1 ) . We found that fatigue prior to the sequence learning did not result in different performance compared to the non-fatigued control group on Day 1 or Day 2 . Both groups had less errors in block 4 than block one in both days , with no group difference on either day ( Day 1: block: F ( 3 , 16 ) = 4 . 474 , p=0 . 021; group: ( F ( 1 , 16 ) = 0 . 329 , p=0 . 574 ) , block*group: ( F ( 3 , 16 ) = 1 . 458 , p=0 . 79; Day 2: block: F ( 3 , 16 ) = 5 . 363 , p=0 . 034; group: ( F ( 1 , 16 ) = 0 . 535 , p=0 . 475 ) , block*group: ( F ( 3 , 16 ) = 2 . 603 , p=0 . 126 ) . The same was true for movement times . Participants decreased their times from block one to block four , but there was no group differences ( Day 1: block: F ( 3 , 16 ) = 146 . 34 , p<0 . 001; group: ( F ( 1 , 16 ) = 0 . 498 , p=0 . 49 ) , block*group: ( F ( 3 , 16 ) = 0 . 169 , p=0 . 972; Day 2: block: F ( 3 , 16 ) = 11 . 31 , p=0 . 004; group: ( F ( 1 , 16 ) = 1 . 106 , p=0 . 309 ) , block*group: ( F ( 3 , 16 ) = 4 . 192 , p=0 . 057; Figure 5 ) . These results indicate that the detrimental effects of muscle fatigue on learning are specific to skill tasks that required fine force-control , but not in more cognitive-demanding tasks . To ensure that the results from the previous experiments were not due to prolonged physical manifestations of fatigue on Day 2 , we fatigued a new group of participants on Day 1 but did not expose them to the pinch force task until the second day ( FTGSKILL-DAY2 , N = 5 ) . On Day 2 , this group showed similar learning rates when compared to the control group on Day 1 ( mean slope FTGSKILL-DAY2 0 . 049; p=0 . 50; see Appendix 1 ) . 3 Discussion We tested motor learning of a skill task under conditions of fatigue . We found that learning in a fatigued state results in detrimental effects on overall task acquisition . These phenomena are present above and beyond the deleterious consequences of fatigue on performance and appears to be domain-specific , and at least in part , centrally mediated . The deleterious fatigue effect was of such a magnitude that took participants twice as much time to reach the level of performance of individuals who learned the task de novo in non-fatigue conditions . These observations need to be carefully considered when designing training protocols such as in sports or musical performance as well as for rehabilitation programs . While conditions of fatigue during sports or performing arts can occur by chance or by overachieving attitudes , rehabilitation programs are particularly at risk because patients with neurological conditions such as those following stroke or multiple sclerosis frequently experience fatigue . 4 Materials and methods A total of 121 healthy participants were recruited from two centers ( Johns Hopkins University and University College London ) . None of the participants suffered from any neurological or psychiatric disorder , nor were they taking any centrally-acting prescribed medication . The experiments were approved by the respective ethics boards at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine Institutional Review Board and the North West London Research Ethics Committee in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and written informed consent as well as consent to publish was obtained from all participants ( ethics board number 00077792 ) . For the first experiment , the sample size was chosen in line with previously reported effect sizes in motor-skill learning studies ( Cantarero et al . , 2013a; Cantarero et al . , 2013b; Reis et al . , 2009 ) . For each experiment , participants were seated in front of a computer monitor and given a force transducer to hold between the thumb and index fingers of their dominant hand . During each trial , participants were instructed to produce isometric pinch presses at different force levels to control the motion of a cursor displayed on the screen . Increasing force resulted in the cursor moving horizontally to the right . Participants were instructed to increase and decrease their pinching force to navigate the cursor through the following sequence: start-gate1-start-gate2-start-gate3-start-gate4-start-end; see Figure 6 . The cursor movement followed logarithmic transduction of the applied pinch force as described in previous studies ( Reis et al . , 2009 ) . This task has been widely used to study skill learning ( e . g . , Reis et al . , 2009; Cantarero et al . , 2013a ) . It involves two components of learning , speed and accuracy , which we could explore independently ( see also Data Analysis and Appendix 1 ) . While the chosen task allows for detailed behavioral assessment of changes underlying learning , due to differences in muscle strengths across fingers involved in the task , the behavioral assessment is potentially less suited to analyze independent mechanisms of peripheral and central fatigue within the hand muscles involved . Participants were seated in front of a computer screen and presented with a horizontal display of five square stimuli ( ‘G’ , ‘H’ , ’ J’ , ‘B’ or ‘N’ ) with one highlighted in green . Subjects were instructed to press as fast as possible the corresponding computer key on a desktop keyboard with their index finger . The next element of the sequence was only presented after the correct key response . If an incorrect key response was pressed , the sequence was paused and only resumed once the appropriate key response was made . Each sequence trial started with the presentation of a ‘go’ cue . Participants were exposed to the same 10-element sequence on each trial and had to perform 30 trials in total to complete one of four blocks . Transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) was administered with a figure-eight coil ( wing diameter = 70 mm ) connected to a Magstim 200 stimulator ( Magstim , UK ) . Using TMS , We located the ‘hot-spot’ of the abductor pollicis brevis muscle in the task-relevant hand at rest according to standardized procedures ( Chen et al . , 2008; Rossini et al . , 1994 ) . The stimulus intensity that elicited a motor evoked potential ( MEP ) with a peak-to-peak amplitude of approximately 1 mV was established ( Stimulus intensity 1 mV , S1mV ) to assess corticomotor excitability . Then 18 MEPs were recorded using the same intensity before the task , directly after the task , and after depotentiation on Day 1 as well as before and after the task at Day 2 . The parameters for depotentiation were based on previous reports ( Cantarero et al . , 2013a; Huang et al . , 2010 ) , consisted of bursts of three pulses at 50 Hz repeated at 200 ms intervals at an intensity of 70% of the rMT for 10 s . Using the 10–20 electroencephalogram coordinate system , Pz was used as a control stimulation location ( SHAM stimulation ) . Stereotactic neuronavigation ( BrainSight , Rogue Research , Montreal , Quebec , Canada ) was used to track coil position within sessions . EMG activity from the abductor pollicis brevis muscle was recorded using surface electrodes taped in a belly-tendon orientation . Data were recorded with an AMT-8 ( Bortec Biomedical Ltd; sampling rate 5000 Hz , amplification 1000x , band-pass filtering 10–1000 Hz ) and saved for offline analysis . For analysis of MVC see Appendix 1 . For each trial in the skill task , movement time and error rate were recorded: movement time was defined as the duration from movement onset ( forced controlled cursor leaving start position ) to reaching the end gate . Error rate was defined as the percentage of trials per block in which participants under- or overshot at least one of the five targets . For the skill learning task , movement time was defined as the duration between the first and the 10th correct key press . Error rate was defined as the percentage of trials per block ( number of errorless sequences per block ) . Movement time and error rate were compared using rmANOVA with the within-subject factor ‘block’ ( four levels: b1 , b2 , b3 and b4 ) and the between-subject factor ‘group’ ( Exp . 1 and 2: two levels , Exp . 3: three levels ) for each single day ( see Appendix 1 ) . To quantify motor performance , we calculated a skill measure , composed of movement time and error rate . As done in prior studies , the skill measure was calculated as: a= ( 1- error rate ) / [error rate ( ln ( movement time ) b ) ] , where b is 5 . 424 as predefined for this particular task in prior studies ( Reis et al . , 2009; Cantarero et al . , 2013b; Mawase et al . , 2017; Spampinato and Celnik , 2017 ) . To study learning ( rate of change in performance ) during the motor task , we plotted the number of blocks on the x-axis and the skill measured on the y-axis . As the relationship was roughly linear , we fit a robust linear regression model ( e . g . , f ( x ) =c*x + b ) for each group; the robust function disregards outliers by estimating an iteratively reweighted least square algorithm . This provided a more parsimonious model than ANOVA , providing a single easily interpretable measure of learning rate given by the slope c . We were particularly interested in measuring and comparing the learning rates between days and groups . When only two blocks were tested ( i . e . the left hand in experiment 2 ) we took the difference between block2 – block1 as a measure of learning rate . Differences in learning rates for each experiment were assessed using a permutation testing procedure . Assuming the null hypothesis of no group difference , participants were randomly re-assigned to the two groups , and the difference in regression coefficients between the resampled groups was computed . This procedure was repeated 10 , 000 times , allowing us to generate a null distribution for the difference between regression coefficients assuming no group differences . The proportion of resampled values that exceeded the true observed difference was used to compute p-values and determine statistical significance . Under the null hypothesis , the true difference in learning rates between the two groups should lie within the distribution of these randomly generated differences , with extreme values providing evidence against the null hypothesis . Prior to application of any parametric tests , the normality of the dependent variables was assessed using Shapiro-Wilk tests and quantile-quantile plots . A log-transformation was applied to correct for any non-normal data . All ANOVA results were Greenhouse-Geisser corrected if the assumption of sphericity was violated . Student’s t-test was used to assess group differences . Results were considered significant at p<0 . 05 , and Bonferroni correction was applied to correct for multiple comparisons . All data are expressed as mean ±standard error unless stated otherwise . Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 22 . 0 and custom-written MATLAB routines .

Accordingly , our perception of space and number are tightly intertwined: for example , people think about numbers on a mental number line , where smaller numbers are mapped to the left , and larger numbers are mapped to the right . Also , damage to a brain region called the parietal cortex disrupts both space and number processing . If number processing recycles the neurons that encode space , which form does this appropriation take ? Recycling could preserve the original behavior of the neurons ( processing space ) , thus enriching the neurons’ functional repertoire with a new capacity ( processing number ) . Alternatively , the newly developed role could replace the original one , such that space and number cohabitate the same brain area but use separate neurons . To disentangle these hypotheses , Schwiedrzik et al . used a technique called 'perceptual adaptation' . Here , continuously showing someone a particular feature eventually exhausts the neurons that respond to that feature . Neurons that respond to the opposite feature are however less exhausted and dominate perception . Consequently , people perceive the opposite of what they are adapted to . For example , after continuously seeing dots moving to the right , people perceive stationary dots as moving to the left . Similarly , after being exposed to large numbers of dots they underestimate how many dots they see . If the same neurons process numbers and space , then adapting to movement in a particular direction should influence number perception . During Schwiedrzik et al . ’s experiments , volunteers watched moving dots on a computer screen . After seeing dots move to the right , they underestimated the number of dots that then appeared on the screen . This is likely to be because larger numbers are mentally mapped to the right , and seeing rightward motion for a long time exhausted these neurons . This means that neurons that respond to smaller numbers ( mentally mapped to the left ) were more active when the new dots were presented , leading the volunteers to underestimate how many dots they saw . Adapting to leftward motion led to the opposite effect , with volunteers overestimating the number of dots . Thus , motion can literally move us up and down the number line . These results indicate that the same neurons encode both space and numbers . Cortical recycling does not erase the neurons’ original behavior: instead , neurons may carry out the same computations when processing numbers or space . This would allow the brain to add new functionality without sacrificing any of the computational resources for processing space .", "article": "1 Introduction Our perception of numerosity and space are tightly interrelated , as evidenced by the ‘mental number line’ , where small numbers are mapped to the left and large numbers are mapped to the right ( Dehaene et al . , 1993 ) . This spatial arrangement of numbers is evident in preverbal infants ( de Hevia and Spelke , 2010 ) , non-human primates ( Drucker and Brannon , 2014 ) , and even birds ( Rugani et al . , 2015 ) , suggesting a deep evolutionary heritage of the mental number line , although there is evidence that it can be influenced by cultural practice ( Shaki and Fischer , 2008 ) . Number-space interactions are attributed to the fact that the neural bases of numerical and space processing both localize to parietal cortex ( Hubbard et al . , 2005 ) , as evidenced by the fact that parietal lesions disrupt both numerical and spatial processing ( Zorzi et al . , 2002 ) . It has been suggested that this co-localization is the result of ‘cortical recycling’ during evolution or normal development ( Anderson , 2010; Dehaene and Cohen , 2007 ) , i . e . , numerical cognition builds upon circuits that originally process space , because the computations that are used to gauge target coordinates or to transform reference frames can also be used for operations on numbers . But to what extent do such recycled circuits retain their original functionality ? Does numerosity replace space , or does it augment it , allowing for shared computations across domains ? We describe a new phenomenon in which visual motion direction , a spatial dimension ubiquitous in dorsal stream areas , adapts numerosity , giving rise to a repulsive aftereffect: motion to the left adapts small numbers , leading to overestimation of numerosity , while motion to the right adapts large numbers , resulting in underestimation . Thus , motion can literally move us up and down the mental number line . This indicates that numerosity coopts circuits encoding space . Furthermore , we show that the reference frame of this cross-adaptation effect is spatiotopic , not retinotopic , which , together with the tuning profile of the adaptation effect , indicates that motion direction-numerosity cross-adaptation may occur in a homolog of area LIP . Thus , recycled numerosity processing circuits indeed remain sensitive to purely spatial features . This shows that ‘cortical recycling’ augments but does not obliterate the spatial capacities of parietal circuits . 2 Results A second characteristic of the neural circuitry in the IPS is that it serves to convert retinotopic coordinates prevalent in early visual areas into eye- , head- , and world-centered frames of reference . In particular , areas LIP and VIP both contain neurons with eye- and head-centered coordinates ( Duhamel et al . , 1997; Mullette-Gillman et al . , 2005 ) . However , the two areas can be distinguished based on their respective receptive field properties: while neurons in area LIP have spatially restricted receptive fields , each covering only a portion of the visual world , number-sensitive neurons in area VIP , the next stage of number processing , respond to stimuli distributed over the entire visual field ( Nieder and Dehaene , 2009 ) . We capitalized on these distinct properties of LIP and VIP and tested in Experiment 6 whether the cross-adaptation effect between motion direction and number occurs in a retinotopic ( early visual areas ) or spatiotopic ( IPS ) frame of reference , and whether it is spatially specific ( LIP ) or occurs over the entire visual field ( VIP ) , thus allowing us to infer the cortical area in which motion and number processing interact . To this end , in Experiment 6 we replicated Experiment 1 but now also manipulated the location of the test/probe stimuli on the screen relative to subjects’ gaze ( Figure 4 ) : Subjects made two saccades between the adaptor and the test/probe stimuli . The second saccade would either bring their gaze back to the initial fixation location ( Figure 4a and d ) , or to a new location 14 degrees visual angle ( dva ) away from the original center of gaze ( Figure 4b and c ) . We then presented the test/probe stimuli either at the same location on the screen as the adaptor ( Figure 4b ) , at the same location as the adapter relative to the subject’s current gaze ( Figure 4c ) , or at a new location ( Figure 4d ) . This allowed us to compare two frames of reference and the spatial specificity of the cross-adaptation effect . If the cross-adaptation effect was present only when subjects looked at a new location on the screen but the stimuli were presented at the same position relative to their current center of gaze ( Figure 4c ) , it must take place in areas with a retinotopic frame of reference , i . e . , early visual areas; if cross-adaptation was evident only when subjects fixated at a new location but the stimuli were presented at the original location on the screen ( Figure 4b ) , it must occur in an area with a spatiotopic frame of reference and with restricted receptive fields , such as LIP; and if it occurred when subjects looked at the original fixation spot but stimuli were presented at a location that neither matched retino- nor spatiotopic reference frames ( Figure 4d ) , the area in which cross-adaptation takes place must support effects across the entire visual field , as would be predicted for VIP . Figure 5 shows that cross-adaptation between motion direction and number occurs even in the presence of two intervening saccades , replicating Experiment 1 . More importantly , the results of Experiment 6 show that cross-adaptation takes place in a spatiotopic , not retinotopic frame of reference , but is restricted to the spatiotopic location of the stimulus and does not extend over the full field of view ( motion direction × reference frame interaction , F ( 3 , 15 ) =4 . 58 , p=0 . 018 , η2=0 . 478 ) . Only the ‘same location’ and the ‘spatiotopic’ condition were significantly different from zero ( both p=0 . 015 , Wilcoxon signed rank tests ) , while the ‘retinotopic’ and ‘full field’ condition were not ( p=0 . 71 and p=0 . 84 , respectively ) . Bayesian statistics ( Benavoli et al . , 2014 ) confirmed that there was overwhelming evidence for an effect in the ‘same location’ and ‘spatiotopic’ ( posterior probabilities >95% ) , but not in the retinotopic ( posterior probability <44 . 5% ) or full field ( posterior probability <29 . 8% ) conditions . Retinal eccentricity cannot explain our results , since it was matched in the ‘same location’ and the ‘retinotopic’ conditions ( 0 dva ) , and in the ‘spatiotopic’ and ‘full field’ conditions ( 14 dva ) , respectively , and thus orthogonal to the factor reference frame . Instead , spatiotopy allots the effect to a family of MAEs which are thought to tap into higher-order motion processing stages , such as the positional motion aftereffect ( Turi and Burr , 2012 ) , in contrast to the classical MAE , which occurs in a retinotopic frame of reference ( Knapen et al . , 2009 ) . This pattern of results is predicted by cross-adaptation occurring in a human LIP homolog . 10 . 7554/eLife . 10806 . 010Figure 4 . Paradigm to test cross-adaptation in different reference frames . The design of Experiment 6 closely followed that of Experiment 1 , but introduced two saccades ( arrows ) between the top-up adaptor and the test/probe stimuli . Initial stimulus and fixation locations are depicted in blue , final stimulus and fixation locations in red . ( a ) In the ‘same location’ condition , subjects made a 14 dva leftward or rightward saccade after the top-up adaptor had been presented , and then back to the original fixation dot . The location of the test/probe stimuli and adaptor was the same in space and on the retina , depicted here as blue ( initial ) and red ( final ) half-cycles . This condition served to replicate the cross-adaptation effect found in Experiment 1 . ( b ) In the ‘spatiotopic’ condition , subjects made two consecutive leftward or rightward saccades ( first 14 dva , second 28 dva ) , and test/probe stimuli were presented at the same screen position as the top-up adaptor but on a different retinal position . Here , a cross-adaptation effect would occur in an area that has spatiotopic but locally restricted receptive fields , such as LIP . ( c ) In the ‘retinotopic’ condition , subjects also made two consecutive leftward or rightward saccades ( first 14 dva , second 28 dva ) but test/probe stimuli were presented above and below the new fixation dot . Hence , stimuli occurred at the same retinal location ( relative to the subjects’ gaze ) , but at different location in spatiotopic coordinates . Here , the cross-adaptation effect would occur in early , retinotopically organized visual areas . ( d ) In the ‘full field’ condition subjects first made rightward or leftward saccaded ( 14 dva ) , and then back to the original fixation dot ( 14 dva , as in the ‘same location’ condition ) . Test/probe stimuli were however presented at a new location opposite to the second saccade direction . Here , a cross-adaptation effect would only occur if the effect takes place in an area with very large receptive fields , such as VIP .

A non-parametric rmANOVA showed that there was a significant interaction between reference frame and motion direction ( F ( 3 , 15 ) =4 . 58 , p=0 . 018 , η2=0 . 478 ) . Only the ‘same location’ condition which replicated Experiment 1 with intervening saccades and the ‘spatiotopic’ condition with restricted receptive field sizes as predicted for area LIP showed a significant ( both p<0 . 05 ) cross-adaptation effect from motion-direction on numerosity ( see text for statistics ) . Together with the tuning function of the effect , this indicates that the influence of motion direction on numerosity takes place at an intermediate , analog stage of number processing , and not in early visual areas with a retinotopic frame of reference or in area VIP with receptive fields covering the entire visual field . Data are represented as mean ± SEM . All data shown here are publicly available at Figshare ( Schwiedrzik et al . , 2015 ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 10806 . 011 3 Discussion Taken together , our results show on purely behavioral grounds that the neural circuits recycled to process number retain sensitivity to a visual feature intimately linked to our sense of space , namely motion direction . This indicates that ‘cortical recycling’ expands the original functionality of a circuit instead of replacing it , thus establishing a functional link across domains . The combination of properties we find in our study , namely the tuning function , receptive field size , and frame of reference of the motion direction-numerosity cross-adaptation effect matches the known properties of area LIP neurons at the first stage of number processing , which are broadly tuned to numerosity ( Roitman et al . , 2007 ) , have relatively small receptive fields ( Ben Hamed et al . , 2001 ) , and a spatiotopic frame of reference ( Mullette-Gillman et al . , 2005 ) . In contrast , neurons in area VIP , the next stage of number processing , are narrowly tuned and have large receptive fields ( Nieder and Dehaene , 2009 ) , and neurons in area MT , a preceding stage of motion processing , have a retinotopic frame of reference ( Born and Bradley , 2005 ) . Hence , a human LIP homolog in the IPS seems to be the most likely origin of the motion direction-numerosity cross-adaptation effect . Motion direction-numerosity cross-adaptation is consistent with studies showing that transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) over parietal cortex can disturb number comparisons and motion detection ( Salillas et al . , 2009 ) , as well as those showing that the number of items in a display can be overestimated when they move at high speed ( Afraz et al . , 2004 ) . However , our studies extend these findings in two critical ways: First , by showing that the very same circuits , and not only the same brain area targeted with TMS , process number and motion; and second , by showing that sensitivity of number processing extends to a spatial feature that is orthogonal to magnitude , namely motion direction ( motion speed is a magnitude itself ) . The latter rules out that motion direction-numerosity cross-adaption is simply the consequence of the operation of a ‘generalized magnitude processing system’ ( Walsh , 2003 ) . Furthermore , as our results were not effector-dependent , they strongly suggest that number-space associations occur at the level of the representation , not sensorimotor mapping , which is another function of parietal cortex ( Fogassi and Luppino , 2005 ) and has been invoked as an alternative explanation for number-space associations ( Keus and Schwarz , 2005 ) . Motion direction-numerosity cross-adaption can also not be easily explained by attention . Because moving stimuli can attract attention in their direction of motion ( Mattingley et al . , 1994; Shi et al . , 2010 ) , it is thinkable that attention was drawn down the number line during leftward motion adaptation , and up the number line during rightward motion adaptation . The consequence of this would however be the opposite pattern of results from what we found , namely underestimation after leftward motion ( because attention is oriented down the number line ) and overestimation after rightward motion ( because attention is oriented up the number line ) . Experiment 4 also ruled out that attention was drawn to the left or to the right by illusory motion arising from a classical MAE ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and Figure 2—figure supplement 2 ) . Hence , attention is an unlikely explanation for motion direction-numerosity cross-adaptation . Our results are indicative of an opponent coding model such as the one proposed for the classical MAE ( Mather and Harris , 1998 ) , in which large and small numerosities compete ( Figure 6 ) . Here , adaptation causes broadly tuned neurons coding for large numbers to reduce their responsiveness , giving rise to an overshoot in the activity of neurons that code for small numbers , and vice versa , leading to under/overestimation . This is evident in the general rightward shift of PSEs reported in Experiment 1 and the leftward shift of PSEs reported in Experiment 2 , and consistent with previously reported adaptation effects of static numerosity ( Burr and Ross , 2008 ) . Our model also captures the co-tuning of leftward motion and small numbers/rightward motion and large numbers: leftward motion increases the activity in the small number pool , resulting in increased overestimation after adaptation , while rightward motion increases the activity in the large number pool , resulting in increased underestimation after adaptation . This causes the differential shifts of PSEs with motion direction along the mental number line . 10 . 7554/eLife . 10806 . 012Figure 6 . Hypothetical model of motion direction-numerosity cross-adaptation . We can explain the cross-adaptation effect using a two-pool opponent coding model similar to what is often invoked to explain the classical MAE and other aftereffects ( Mather and Harris , 1998 ) . Panel ( a ) exemplifies the effect of motion direction during adaptation with large numerosities ( Experiment 1 , Figure 2a ) , panel ( b ) exemplifies the effect of motion direction during adaptation with small numerosities ( Experiment 2 , Figure 2c ) . The two black lines reflect the activity level of two broadly tuned pools of neurons that respond maximally to small or large numbers , respectively . The tuning curves are overlapping such that any given stimulus produces activity in both pools . Adaptation to number causes each pool to reduce its firing rate proportionally to how well the stimulus activates the respective pool in the non-adapted state , e . g . , static or randomly moving dot clouds with large numbers of dots ( as in Experiment 1 , e . g . , in the lower cloud , or in Burr and Ross , 2008 ) lead to stronger adaptation in the pool for large numbers ( blue ) . After adaptation , this pool’s response is reduced , shifting the point at which the two tuning curves intersect to the either to the right ( a ) , i . e . , towards larger numbers , or to the left ( b ) , i . e . , towards smaller numbers . This also shifts the point of subjective equality ( PSE ) in a comparison task ( gray ) , leading to an underestimation ( a ) or overestimation ( b ) in how many dots are perceived . During adaptation with large numerosities , rightwards motion exaggerates underestimation ( a ) by activating the pool for large numbers more strongly , moving perception up the number line ( green , inset ) , subsequently causing a stronger cross-adaptation effect ( underestimation ) . In contrast , leftwards motion reduces the effect , moving perception down the number line ( orange , inset ) , subsequently causing a cross-adaption effect in the opposite direction . During adaptation with small numerosities , leftwards motion exaggerates overestimation ( b ) by activating the pool for small numbers more strongly , moving perception down the number line ( green , inset ) , subsequently causing a stronger overestimation effect . Rightwards motion reduces overestimation , moving perception up the number line ( orange , inset ) . Monotonically increasing and decreasing tuning curves are consistent with numerosity tuning curves measured in monkey LIP ( Roitman et al . , 2007 ) and with the fact that we could exert an effect on the perception dot numerosities far removed from the adaptor , e . g . , perception of 23–107 dots when adapting with 400 dots in Experiment 1 , which would not be expected if each number was represented by narrow tuning curves as those found in monkey VIP ( Nieder et al . , 2006 ) . This was also supported by Experiment 5 which showed that there was no motion direction-numerosity cross-adaption when the number of dots in the adapter and the probe were matched ( mean difference right vs . left −3 . 69 , p=0 . 92 , Wilcoxon signed rank test , one-sided; Bayesian posterior probability <0 . 18% ) , as predicted for two-pool opponent coding models ( Robbins et al . , 2007; Webster , 2011 ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 10806 . 012 Opponent coding further suggests that large adaptor – probe/test distances should lead to large repulsive aftereffects as they maximize the differential response ratio between the two pools , while models with multiple , narrowly tuned channels would predict the opposite ( Robbins et al . , 2007; Webster , 2011 ) . Specifically , if narrowly tuned neurons such as those found in area VIP ( Nieder et al . , 2006 ) are adapted , the strongest effects of adaptation occur directly around the adaptor , while effects fall off as a function of adaptor-test/probe distance . This is characteristic of multichannel models . In contrast , in two-pool opponent coding with broadly tuned neurons such as those found in area LIP ( Roitman et al . , 2007 ) , adaptation at the probe location leads to no or only very small effects ( assuming the probe stimulus serves as an explicit reference point ) , as adaptation influences the activity in both pools approximately equally , thus merely reinforcing the current level of overall adaptation . Indeed , we found that large adaptor – probe/test distances led to large repulsive aftereffects , while adapting and probing with the same number of dots did not lead to a significant motion direction-specific aftereffect . This further speaks for two-pool opponent coding and against multichannel models underlying numerosity adaptation . Together , this suggests that current theoretical models of number processing ( e . g . , Dehaene and Changeux , 1993 ) should be expanded to include such an opponent process at the analog summation stage , which would be compatible with the broad neural tuning curves found in monkey area LIP ( Roitman et al . , 2007 ) . Finally , it has been shown that the approximate number sense predicts later mathematical achievement ( Halberda et al . , 2008 ) . If the link between motion and number can be further substantiated , it may open the venue to utilizing motion processing as a marker for number skill development ( Sigmundsson et al . , 2010 ) , and thus to identify children at risk for dyscalculia early in life . 4 Materials and methods Fifty-five subjects participated in six experiments: In Experiment 1 we investigated motion direction-numerosity cross-adaptation with large numerosities in 11 subjects ( 4 female , mean age 22 . 8 years , range 19–33 years , 9 right handed ) . In Experiment 2 , we tested for motion direction-numerosity cross-adaptation with small numerosities in 11 subjects ( 4 female , mean age 27 . 1 years , range 22–35 years , 9 right handed ) ; one subject had to be excluded from data analyses because of an apparent failure to do the task . Experiment 3 addressed direct effects of motion direction on numerosity perception in the absence of adaptation in 10 subjects ( 5 female , mean age 32 . 2 years , range 18–48 years , 9 right handed ) . Experiment 4 served as a control for classical MAEs in 11 subjects ( 6 female , mean age 33 . 45 years , range 23–48 years , 10 right handed ) . Experiment 5 allowed us to contrast different coding schemes , i . e . , two-pool opponent process vs . multichannel models in 6 subjects ( 3 female , mean age 29 . 8 years , range 22–39 years , 5 right handed ) . Experiment 6 was conducted to probe the reference frame of motion direction numerosity cross-adaptation in 6 subjects ( 2 female , mean age 23 . 1 years , range 21–30 years , all right handed ) . All subjects had normal or corrected-to-normal vision , reported no history of neurological or psychiatric disease , and gave written informed consent before participation . All procedures were approved by The University Committee on Activities Involving Human Subjects at New York University . Subjects received monetary compensation for their participation . Stimulus presentation and response collection in all experiments were controlled using Presentation ( v17 . 2; Neurobehavioral Systems , Berkeley , CA , USA ) . Trials on which reaction times exceeded 2*median absolute deviation were excluded from the analyses . Psychometric functions were fitted in the Palamedes Toolbox ( v1 . 7 . 0 ) ( Prins and Kingdom , 2009 ) in Matlab ( R2012b , The Mathworks , Natick , MA , USA ) , using a logistic function to obtain threshold and slope estimates per subject ( fits using a cumulative Gaussian function yielded similar results ) . For Experiments 1 , 2 , and 3 threshold and slope estimates , respectively , were compared using paired t-tests ( two-sided ) in SPSS ( v22 , IBM , Armonk , NY , USA ) . Effect sizes were computed as Hedges’ d ( Hedges and Olkin , 1985 ) , where values >0 . 8 indicate a large effect and values <0 . 5 indicate a small effect . For Experiment 4 , we compared mean percentage ‘same’ responses using two-sided one-sample and paired t-tests; analyses of median percent ‘same’ responses using a percentile bootstrap procedure ( Wilcox , 2010 ) yielded the same results . Given the sample sizes in Experiments 5 and 6 , we resorted to non-parametric tests . Because we had a directional hypothesis ( PSE right>left ) in both experiments , planned comparisons were performed using one-sided exact Wilcoxon signed rank tests , but two-sided tests yielded identical patterns of results . In Experiment 6 , threshold estimates were also entered into a non-parametric two factor repeated measures analysis of variance ( rmANOVA ) based on the aligned rank transform ( Higgins and Tashtoush , 1994 ) using ARTool ( v1 . 5 . 1 ) ( Wobbrock et al . , 2011 ) to assess interaction effects . Effect size was computed as partial η2 , where values >0 . 14 indicate a large effect and values <0 . 06 indicate a small effect . Spatial reference frames in Experiment 6 were determined by testing each experimental condition against 0 . While it is standard in the literature to compare reference frames by contrasting conditions against 0 ( Arrighi et al . , 2014; Knapen et al . , 2009; Turi and Burr , 2012 ) , we note that such conclusions partially rest on non-significant results . We thus also performed Bayesian statistics , using an exact Wilcoxon signed rank test based on the prior ignorance Dirichlet process model ( 200000 samples , concentration parameter s=0 . 53 ) ( Benavoli et al . , 2014 ) to support our conclusions . All data are publicly available at Figshare ( Schwiedrzik et al . , 2015 ) ."}

The axial skeleton is predominantly involved and commonly affected sites include the skull , spine , and pelvis . Paget’s disease is clinically silent until it has reached an advanced stage at which point irreversible damage to the skeleton has occurred ( Tan and Ralston , 2014 ) . Bisphosphonates are an effective treatment ( Ralston et al . , 2019 ) and can often improve bone pain but have a limited impact on other clinical outcomes in patients with advanced disease ( Langston et al . , 2010; Reid et al . , 2011 ) . On a cellular level , PDB is characterized by increased osteoclast activity and biopsies from affected bone lesions exhibit increase in the number and size of osteoclasts . Genetic factors play an important role in classical PDB and in monogenic PDB-like syndromes ( Gennari et al . , 2019; Ralston and Albagha , 2014 ) . Mutations in SQSTM1 are the most common cause of PDB , but other susceptibility genes and loci have been identified through genome-wide association studies ( Vallet et al . , 2015; Albagha et al . , 2011; Albagha et al . , 2010 ) . These include genes that play an important role in osteoclast differentiation such as CSF1 , TNFRSF11A , and DCSTAMP . Additionally , an expression quantitative trait locus ( eQTL ) in OPTN is associated with increased susceptibility to PDB ( Obaid et al . , 2015 ) . Functional analysis using mouse models showed that OPTN is a negative regulator of osteoclast differentiation and mice with loss of OPTN function develop PDB-like bone lesions with increasing age ( Obaid et al . , 2015; Wong et al . , 2020 ) . Environmental factors also play a role , as evidenced by the fact that the disease is focal in nature and its incidence and severity has diminished in recent years ( Corral-Gudino et al . , 2013 ) . Several environmental triggers have been suggested including persistent viral infection , repetitive mechanical loading of the skeleton , low dietary calcium intake , environment pollutants , and vitamin D deficiency ( Ralston and Albagha , 2014 ) . The possible role of persistent viral infection with measles and distemper has been studied experimentally . For example , expression of the measles virus nucleocapsid protein in osteoclasts was found to trigger PDB-like phenotype in mice ( Kurihara et al . , 2011; Kurihara et al . , 2006 ) . However , clinical studies that have sought to detect evidence of viral proteins and nucleic acids in humans with PDB have yielded conflicting results ( Ralston et al . , 2019 ) . Accumulating evidence suggests that environmental and lifestyle factors can influence gene expression and clinical phenotype in various diseases through epigenetic mechanisms such as changes in DNA methylation . To gain insights into the role of epigenetic DNA methylation in PDB , we have conducted genome-wide profiling of DNA methylation in a cohort of 253 PDB patients and 280 controls and evaluated the predictive role of epigenetic markers in differentiating patients with PDB from controls . 2 Results Table 1 shows descriptive statistics for the study cohort . PDB cases in the discovery set were slightly older and included more males compared to controls , but no difference in age or gender distribution was found in the cross-validation set . The number of patients with SQSTM1 mutations was similar in the discovery and cross-validation set and accounts for approximately 14% of PDB cases . All controls were negative for SQSTM1 mutations as shown in Table 1 . Figure 1 shows the study design and summary of differential methylation results . After adjusting for all confounders , differential methylation analysis of the discovery set revealed 419 differentially methylated sites ( DMS ) with false discovery rate ( FDR ) < 0 . 05 , of which 57 reached statistical significance ( FDR < 0 . 05 ) in the cross-validation set ( Supplementary file 1 ) . Meta-analysis of the DMS from discovery and cross-validation revealed 14 Bonferroni significant DMS out of a total of 429 , 156 tested CpG sites ( p<1 . 17×10−7; Table 2 ) . The direction of effect for all replicated DMS was identical in the discovery and cross-validation set and shows hypermethylation in PDB cases compared to controls . A Manhattan plot of the results is shown in Figure 2A , and a quantile–quantile ( Q–Q ) plot is presented in Figure 2—figure supplement 1 . Besides analyzing individual sites , our region-based analysis was intended to uncover densely hyper/hypo-methylated regions with unique effects across the genome in PDB as well as identifying instances where the effect from individual sites is moderate , yet accumulatively significant . We tested natural concentrations of sites with independent effects within CpG islands but also gene bodies and promoter regions , justified by the fact that promoter methylation often suppresses transcription whilst that from the gene body often stimulates gene expression ( Figure 1 ) . Evaluation of the 25 , 773 CpG islands on the array revealed 978 differentially methylated regions ( DMR ) that were significantly differentially methylated ( FDR < 0 . 05 ) in the discovery set , of which 111 replicated at the same significance level in the cross-validation set ( Supplementary file 2 ) . Stringent Bonferroni multiple testing correction revealed four islands that remained significant in the discovery and cross-validation , and these were located near LTB , SKIV2L , EBF3 , and CCND1 ( Table 3 ) . Gene body analysis revealed 258 ( FDR < 0 . 05 ) replicated DMR out of a total of 947 differentially methylated genes initially identified in the discovery set ( Supplementary file 3 ) . Six gene body DMR reached significance after Bonferroni correction in both the discovery and cross-validation set ( Table 3 ) . In the context of promoter regions , evidence for FDR significant association with the disease was equally observed in the discovery and cross-validation set for 27 promoters DMR ( Supplementary file 4 ) , but none reached significance after Bonferroni correction . Figure 2B and C show a regional plot for DMR within LTB and HSPA13 from island and gene body analysis respectively , highlighting the co-occurrence of multiple , yet independent , differentially methylated sites along each region . To gain further insight into the pathology of PDB , we explored common methylation patterns amongst functional keywords identified as significantly over-represented amongst the Pooled sites ( a unified list of 2847 candidate CpGs identified from the DMS and DMR analysis , refer to Materials and methods ) . Figure 3 shows a graphical representation of these functional keywords . In addition to bone-related cells , there is a strong presence of immune cells linked to key biological processes including proliferation , differentiation , autophagy , and cell death . Furthermore , virus , cytokines , and interferon-gamma were among the over-represented keywords . The process of ubiquitination lies at the center of the graph with the largest number of links in the network . In order to determine whether differentially methylated markers might be of diagnostic value , we performed orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis ( OPLS-DA ) in the discovery and cross-validation cohorts ( refer to Materials and methods ) . The results are summarized in Figure 4 . The OPLS-DA procedure was first performed using the combined set of significant DMS and DMR identified from the discovery set ( Pooled sites; n = 2847 , refer to Materials and methods for further details ) and when the classifier was tested on the cross-validation set , it yielded an area under curve ( AUC ) of 92 . 8% . To identify sites with the highest predictive ability , we applied the net regularization extension of the generalized linear model approach on the Pooled sites , which resulted in the identification of 95 sites ( which we also refer to as ‘Best subset’ sites; Supplementary file 5 ) , of the 2847 initial Pooled sites , as best discriminatory of PDB cases and controls ( Figure 1 ) . The OPLS-DA procedure performed on this Best subset resulted in an AUC of 82 . 5% . A rather superior performance in comparison to similarly trained classifiers based on the DMS ( AUC = 67% ) , islands DMR ( AUC = 76% ) , or promoter DMR ( AUC = 79% ) analyses . On the other hand , the AUC from a classifier restricted to the DMR gene bodies was 92% , which is similar to that obtained from the whole Pooled sites ( AUC = 92 . 8 , Figure 3 ) . Functional enrichment analysis of the 95 Best subset sites was consistent between Ingenuity Pathway Analysis ( IPA ) and Gene Ontology ( GO ) with many genes annotated to the following broad functional terms: immune function , bone lesions and bone homeostasis , and viral processes . Several identified genes fell into more than one category . Overlaying the IPA knowledge-based repository of molecular interactions identified a handful of functional links between the genes located in the Best subset sites , highlighting important functional subnetworks ( Figure 5A ) . Additionally , we found that the effect size ( absolute difference in DNA methylation between controls and PDB cases ) was significantly higher for sites from the Best subset ( mean ± SD; 0 . 011 ± 0 . 019 ) compared to the rest of those in the Pooled sites ( 0 . 007 ± 0 . 01; p-value=1 . 9×10−3 ) . The magnitude of effect from each site in the Best subset , as calculated by the elastic-net regularization extension of the generalized linear model , is color-coded in Figure 5B . DNA methylation profiles are known to be tissue specific , and our DMS and DMR analyses were performed on blood , but the primary relevant tissue in PDB is bone . Therefore , we assessed if the methylation profiles for the DMS and DMR identified from this study are correlated between blood and bone tissue using previously published data by Ebrahimi et al . , 2021 . In their study , Ebrahimi et al . focused the correlation analysis on 64 , 349 CpG probes that fit their analysis criteria to define the most highly correlated positions , of which 28 , 549 CpG sites showed significant ( FDR < 0 . 05 ) high correlation ( r2 > 0 . 74 ) between bone and blood . We assessed if CpG sites annotated to genes identified from our DMS and DMR analyses ( Tables 2 and 3 ) showed high correlation between bone and blood as reported by Ebrahimi et al . , 2021 . Results showed that CpGs annotated to 8 of the 14 genes from our DMS analysis were among the highly correlated sites between blood and bone ( r2 > 0 . 74; FDR < 0 . 05 ) ; Supplementary file 6 . For DMRs , of the 10 genes reported in our study ( Table 3 ) , 6 had at least one CpG with high correlation between blood and bone ( Supplementary file 6 ) . eQTM analysis , based on the BIOS QTL ( Bonder et al . , 2017; Bios QTL , 2021 ) , showed that the Bonferroni significant DMS cg10964367 was associated with the expression level of ARHGEF10 ( p=3 . 9×10−9 ) . Additionally , cg26724726 from gene body analysis was associated with the expression of LTB ( p=1 . 10×10−5 ) , and eight of the Best subset sites were associated with the expression of nearby genes ( Supplementary file 7 ) . 3 Discussion The present study is the first to investigate DNA methylation profiles in PDB . DNA methylation profiles from PDB patients were compared to controls , and meta-analysis of discovery and cross-validation revealed 14 genome-wide significant DMS . Many were located within or near genes with functional relevance to the pathogenesis of PDB including bone-related functions , such as osteoclast differentiation , or functions related to environmental triggers associated with PDB such as viral infection and mechanical loading . TNK1 is a tyrosine kinase that has a pivotal role in innate immune responses by regulating the Interferon-stimulated genes downstream of the JAK-STAT pathway ( Ooi et al . , 2014 ) . It has previously been associated with frontotemporal dementia ( Gijselinck et al . , 2015 ) , which can co-exist with Paget’s disease ( Watts et al . , 2004 ) . MOSC2 is a member of the membrane-bound E3 ubiquitin ligase family that regulates endosome trafficking ( Zhang et al . , 2018 ) . Less is known about the specific functions of transcription factors NKX6-2 and LBX1 in bone metabolism , but mutations in the latter are associated with Scoliosis . HS6ST3 plays a key role in the synthesis of heparan sulfate that potentiates key growth factors including the bone morphogenic protein BMP and Wnt ( Kuo et al . , 2010 ) . PENK encodes for proenkephalin , the precursor of a range of effector molecules including pain-associated pentapeptide opioids as well as modulators of osteoblast differentiation ( Seitz et al . , 2010 ) . Interestingly , PENK knockout mice have abnormal bone structure and mineralization ( Dickinson et al . , 2016 ) . MAF was found to promote osteoblast differentiation , and heterozygous deletion of MAF in mice results in age-related bone loss associated with accelerated formation of fatty marrow ( Nishikawa et al . , 2010 ) . SPATA18 is expressed in a variety of cancers including osteosarcoma , and its transcription is induced by p53 ( Bornstein et al . , 2011 ) . TAL1 has been found to regulate osteoclast differentiation through suppression of their fusion mediator DCSTAMP ( Courtial et al . , 2012 ) . The zinc finger protein ZIC1 has a role in shear flow mechanotransduction in osteocytes ( Kalogeropoulos et al . , 2010 ) . Expression of ZIC1 in human was found to be increased in loaded compared to unloaded bone , and the increased expression in loaded bone is associated with reduced methylation in several CpGs in ZIC1 ( Varanasi et al . , 2010 ) . NFYB confers chromatin access to other transcriptional regulators and is known to be involved in transition through cell cycle ( Ly et al . , 2013 ) . Finally , the centrosomal ARHGEF10 has a role in the formation of mitotic spindle during mitosis ( Shibata et al . , 2019 ) . Our analysis was extended to identify regions with frequent but independent methylation changes in PDB amongst sites that are adjacent to each other . Genomic regions have traditionally been evaluated in epigenetics studies based on linear combinations of methylation data from residing sites or through meta-analysis of effects/p-values from an initial site-level differential methylation analysis . The novel approach presented in this study differs from the traditional methods in that enrichment of a region does not stem from frequent occurrences of correlated DMS within the region but rather the accumulation of independent effects from residing sites . In other words , regions with the most , but unique site-level effects are prioritized . By doing so , our approach is advantageous in two ways: First , it allows for sites to be hyper- or hypo-methylated along the same region unlike the linear combination approach where opposing effects could neutralize one another . Second , it draws strength from the collective effects of neighboring sites whilst avoiding the redundancy of information from site-level analysis . Four Bonferroni significant DMR were identified in islands , which were located near the following genes: LTB , a cytokine shown to stimulate osteoclast activity; SKIV2L , with an RNA helicase activity , thought to be involved in blocking translation of viral mRNA and has been implicated in regulating host responses to viral infections ( Eckard et al . , 2014 ) ; EBF3 , which is involved in bone development and B cell differentiation ( Seike et al . , 2018 ) ; and CCND1 , a Wnt target that was reported to be upregulated in response to mechanical loading of bone ( Holguin et al . , 2016 ) . Additionally , six Bonferroni significant DMR in gene bodies were identified . These were located within genes with functions related to mitosis and ciliogenesis ( SDCCAG8 ) ( Insolera et al . , 2014 ) : TGFB1-mediated signaling ( RBPMS ) ( Shanmugaapriya et al . , 2016 ) ; calcium signaling ( CACNA1B ) ( Blair et al . , 2007 ) ; protein ubiquitination ( HSPA13 ) ( Kaye et al . , 2000 ) ; cytoskeletal organization ( PARD3B ) ( Kohjima et al . , 2002 ) ; and histone acetylation ( BRD1 ) ( Mishima et al . , 2014 ) . The Pooled sites identified from the discovery set were able to discriminate cases and controls with a considerable accuracy when tested on the cross-validation set . The Best subset analysis allowed the identification of a smaller subset of sites trading off the classification accuracy with the number of explanatory sites . The AUC of 82 . 5% , based on the 95 discriminatory sites from the best subset analysis , is promising , and future experiments are warranted to study its clinical applicability . In terms of disease pathology , the DNA methylation data reflected many environmental triggers thought to be involved in PDB . Some of the genes amongst the DMS and the 95 Best subset were associated with immune antiviral responses ( Figure 5 , Supplementary file 5 ) . This is of interest since a previous study in the PRISM cohort showed that levels of antibodies to Mumps virus were significantly higher in PDB cases compared to controls ( Visconti et al . , 2017 ) . Although we and others have failed to detect evidence of ongoing virus infection in PDB , the above data is consistent with the hypothesis that host immune responses to infection may be altered in PDB . Differential methylation of ZIC1 and CCND1 indicates possible differences between cases and controls in these genes , which are involved in mechanotransduction , a process that has been implicated in localization of bone lesions in PDB ( Gasper , 1979 ) . Our study also highlighted genes that regulate the cell cycle , vesicular transport , and cytoskeletal reorganization as being potentially involved in PDB . Other genes were identified that play a role in immune cell function , and these were strongly represented in the best subset of differentially methylated sites . This lends support to the hypothesis that PDB may be a disorder with an osteoimmunological basis ( Numan et al . , 2015 ) and should prompt further work to investigate host–environment interactions including studies of the microbiome in this complex but fascinating disease ( Ohlsson and Sjögren , 2018 ) . Apart from providing new insights into the potential links between genes and environment in regulating susceptibility to PDB , this study has revealed the potential role of methylation signals as a biomarker for disease susceptibility . Potent bisphosphonates such as zoledronic acid can return the abnormalities of bone remodeling to normal in a large proportion of patients with PDB ( Reid et al . , 2011; Reid et al . , 2005; Tan et al . , 2017 ) . Unfortunately , PDB often remains clinically silent until it has reached an advanced stage by which point irreversible skeletal damage may already have occurred ( Gennari et al . , 2019 ) . This study raises the possibility that epigenetic markers , possibly when combined with genetic profiling , would be worth exploring as means of assessing the risk of developing PDB in people with a family history of the disorder so that early intervention can be considered where clinically appropriate . One limitation of the study is the fact that the identified methylation changes were not shown to occur in the osteoclasts , which are the cells of main interest in PDB pathogenesis . This is primarily justified by the difficulty to collect bone tissue from PDB patients in a similarly sized cohort . Nevertheless , on comparison of our Bonferroni significant DMS and DMR ( Tables 2 and 3 ) , with a published list of highly concordant CpG sites between blood and femur bone tissue collected during hip replacement surgery ( Ebrahimi et al . , 2021 ) , we noted considerable overlap . We found that CpGs annotated to 8 of the 14 genes from our DMS analysis were among the highly correlated sites between blood and bone ( Supplementary file 6 ) . For DMRs , of the 10 genes reported in our study ( Table 3 ) , 6 had at least one CpG with high correlation between blood and bone ( Supplementary file 6 ) . However , showing an epigenetic signature to PDB in the blood adds to the increasing evidence in the literature pointing to the possibility of pathogenic immune processes lying at the heart of PDB . More importantly , a predictive epigenetic signature in a readily accessible tissue such as the blood has clinical implication , also considering the silent nature of PDB and the possibility of avoiding much of the adverse symptoms of the disease with early diagnosis . Moreover , one needs to consider that blood also contains progenitors of bone cells and that white blood cells share a similar ancestry with osteoclasts . Although the split-sample approach was meant to allow for validation of the results for increased statistical rigor , our cross-validation dataset is not totally independent from its discovery counterpart in that similar sources of noise and counfounding effects are present in both . However , the total cohort was obtained from a large number of centers across the UK representing most major cities , which adds to the validity of our overall results . Another limiting aspect of our study was drawing functional relevance of our DMS and DMR by reference to tissue specific eQTMs from the BIOS QTL database , which were originally derived from blood . Therefore , the effects of the differential methylation from our candidates DMS and DMR on gene expression under PDB remain to be investigated . Finally , it is possible that the observed methylation changes reported in this study exist as a consequence of the disease; therefore , further prospective studies assessing their true potential as predictor biomarkers are warranted . Such studies could revolve around recruiting individuals with a genetic predisposition and/or family history of PDB for which the level of methylation of our 95 best subset sites can be routinely assessed . Such epigenetic measurements can then be linked to future disease onset if any , in the presence of appropriate controls . 4 Materials and methods The DNA samples were derived from UK-based PDB patients and controls who took part in the PRISM trial ( Paget’s Disease: Randomized Trial of Intensive versus Symptomatic Management ) ( ISRCTN12989577 ) ( Tan et al . , 2017 ) . The PRISM trial is a multi-center study in which participants were recruited from 27 different clinical centers across the United Kingdom . The epigenetic analysis was conducted in 253 cases with clinical and radiological evidence of PDB and 280 controls who were spouses of PDB cases ( n = 135 ) or subjects who had been referred for investigation of osteoporosis but had normal bone density upon examination by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry ( n = 131 ) . The cohort was randomly divided into a discovery and cross-validation set comprising of comparable numbers of cases and controls ( Figure 1 ) . According to the study by Tsai and Bell , a 10% difference in the mean of CpG methylation level between cases and controls at genome-wide significance level of 10−6 requires 112 individuals in each group to achieve 80% EWAS power ( Tsai and Bell , 2015 ) . On this basis , our discovery set comprising of 116 cases and 130 controls is adequately powered , and the results are further validated in an equally sized cross-validation set . Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood using standard protocols . Bisulfite conversion was performed on 500 µg of DNA using Zymo EZ-96 DNA methylation Kit ( RRID:SCR_008968 , Zymo Research , USA ) . DNA methylation profiling was performed using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation 450K array ( Illumina , USA ) by following the manufacturer’s protocol . The R package RnBeads version 1 . 10 . 8 ( RRID:SCR_010958 ) was used for quality control ( Müller et al . , 2019 ) . Samples with low methylated or unmethylated median intensity ( <11 . 0 ) were excluded ( n = 35 ) , along with samples with sex mismatch between reported and predicted sex ( n = 0 ) . Probes with the following criteria were excluded: detection p-value > 0 . 05 , cross-reactive probes , containing a SNP within 3 bp of nucleotide extension site , or those located on sex chromosomes . Additionally , 723 sites were further excluded from the dataset for previously established association with smoking ( Ambatipudi et al . , 2016 ) . A total of 56 , 356 probes were excluded from the initial 485 , 512 leaving 429 , 156 CpGs for analysis ( Figure 1 ) . The final dataset used for analysis comprised of 232 PDB cases and 260 controls . The Enmix method ( Pidsley et al . , 2013 ) was used for background correction , whilst SWAN was used to achieve between and within array normalization . For all downstream analysis , the M-values , derived using the formulae log2 ( ( methylated signal +1 ) / ( unmethylated signal +1 ) ) , were used . An overview of the analysis performed in this study is shown in Figure 1 , in what follows we provide details of each analysis step: To assess the effect of DNA methylation at CpG sites on the expression of nearby genes , we used data from the BIOS QTL browser ( Bonder et al . , 2017; Bios QTL , 2021 ) ."}
{"doi": "elife-14188-v1", "abstract": "Echolocating bats have excellent spatial memory and are able to navigate to salient locations using bio-sonar . Navigating and route-following require animals to recognize places . Currently , it is mostly unknown how bats recognize places using echolocation . In this paper , we propose template based place recognition might underlie sonar-based navigation in bats . Under this hypothesis , bats recognize places by remembering their echo signature - rather than their 3D layout . Using a large body of ensonification data collected in three different habitats , we test the viability of this hypothesis assessing two critical properties of the proposed echo signatures: ( 1 ) they can be uniquely classified and ( 2 ) they vary continuously across space . Based on the results presented , we conclude that the proposed echo signatures satisfy both criteria . We discuss how these two properties of the echo signatures can support navigation and building a cognitive map .", "plain language summary": "Bats produce loud calls and listen to the returning echoes to find their way around . This process , known as echolocation , is sometimes described as 'seeing with sound' . The way bats perceive the world through echolocation , however , is fundamentally different from how we experience it through vision . Echolocation provides much less information about the world than vision does , but despite this , bats are agile navigators and hunters . It is not clear how bats navigate so well without much information . In particular , researchers would like to know how echolocating bats recognize the places that they regularly visit while foraging and navigating . When we visually recognize places , we identify and localize the various objects making up the scene . But echolocation is unlikely to provide enough information to allow bats to identify and localize the objects in a particular place . To investigate how bats recognize places , Vanderelst et al . built an artificial bat: a device that contained ultrasonic microphones to act like the bat’s ears and an ultrasonic speaker to act like the bat’s mouth . The artificial bat device was then used to collect echoes from different locations in real bat habitats . Processing the echoes using machine-learning techniques showed that the echoes that returned from each location were different enough for a computer to recognize the location . By using a simplified version of the echoes , Vanderelst et al . also showed that the locations could be recognized even if there was not enough information to identify specific objects or vegetation at the site . This suggests that bats do not simply use echolocation to recreate the three-dimensional layout of a location , as some researchers have proposed . While much remains to be learned about how bats use echolocation for navigation , future work that teases out bat navigation strategies might help us to build robots that can navigate using similar tactics .", "article": "1 Introduction One possible mechanism for sonar based recognition of places is to localize and classify the individual objects in the scene observed from that place is composed of ( Lewicki et al . , 2014 ) . Under this assumption , bats would reconstruct a ( presumably , 3D ) model of the layout of a given place and match this with a set of previously stored representations , e . g . ( Barchi et al . , 2013; Moss and Surlykke , 2001; Schnitzler et al . , 2003 ) . In other words , this mechanism implies that bats reconstruct a mental image of the environment from the echoes and use this to recognize a previously visited place . Under favourable conditions , extracting a description of a set of localized objects from the echoes is possible as the position , shape , size and texture of objects are all encoded in the binaural spectra of the echoes , e . g . ( Reijniers et al . , 2010; Schmidt , 1988; Von Helversen and Von Helversen , 2003; Peremans et al . , 2012; Wotton and Simmons , 2000; Simon et al . , 2011; Genzel and Wiegrebe , 2013 ) . However , a number of limitations of bio-sonar render it uncertain whether bats are able to apply such a place recognition strategy . Low signal-to-noise ratio obscures echo spectra ( Reijniers et al . , 2010 ) . Moreover , ambiguity of cues is introduced by concurrently encoding in the spectral cues both location and other properties of objects . For example , a spectral notch could be introduced by either the head related transfer function ( encoding the object’s location ) or the transfer function of the reflector ( encoding the object’s shape ) . This complicates extracting both object properties and object positions . Reconstructing the 3D position of objects is further complicated by the fact that , compared to vision , sonar has a limited field of view ( Surlykke et al . , 2009 ) , a low update rate ( Kleeman and Kuc , 2008; Peremans et al . , 2012 ) and a limited range ( Stilz and Schnitzler , 2012 ) . While most of these limitations to reconstructing the layout of objects could potentially be addressed by integrating information across calls , this would entail both time and complexity penalties . In addition , the capacity for reconstructing the 3D layout of objects is limited by the finite temporal resolution of the bat’s auditory system . The temporal integration in the auditory system severely limits the spatial resolution of biosonar and introduces interference between echoes . In a psychophysical experiment , Wiegrebe and Schmidt ( 1996 ) observed a temporal integration constant of about 200 μs in Megaderma lyra . Simmons and colleagues ( Simmons et al . , 1989 ) derived an integration constant of about 200–400 μs for the bat Eptesicus fuscus . Echoes from objects separated in time by less than the response time of the auditory filters will be integrated ( Simmons et al . , 1989 ) , thereby limiting bats’ ability to resolve the objects’ locations and properties . The limitations imposed by temporal integration can be appreciated by considering the volume of space across which echoes are integrated by the sonar system . This volume can be appropriately described as a section of a spherical shell . The thickness of the shell is determined by the temporal integration of the hearing apparatus . The opening angle of the section is determined by the directionality of the sonar system . Hence , the integrated volume increases rapidly for larger distances from the bat ( See Figure 1 and equation therein ) . For example , at a distance of 7 . 8 meters , an echolocation system with a beamwidth of 45 degrees is estimated to integrate the echoes originating from a volume of over 1 m3 . At the same distance , a system with a functional beamwidth of 60 degrees integrates echoes from a volume of about 2 m3 . Echoes originating from reflectors within this volume will be integrated and it is not clear that they will be perceived as individual echoes ( Geberl , 2013 ) . Indeed , in general , this volume will contain multiple reflectors . This is especially true when the scene contains complex objects such as leafy trees or bushes ( See Yovel et al . , 2008 for examples of echo trains returning from vegetation ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 14188 . 003Figure 1 . Integration volume as a function of distance . The integration volume calculated for different beamwidths ϕ as a function of distance from the bat . The integration volume is approximated as a section of a spherical shell . The opening angle of the section is given by the beam width ϕ . The thickness of the shell Δ⁢r is given by the temporal integration of the sonar system . The temporal integration of the sonar system has been assumed to be 200 μs yielding an integration distance ( i . e . thickness of the shell ) of about 0 . 034 m . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 14188 . 003 Finally , it should be noted that the integration constant used to compute the volume of the sphere represents a very conservative upper boundary for the temporal resolution of the auditory system . Indeed , non-simultaneous masking effects have been found to extend for substantially longer intervals than the integration time ( both in bats and humans [Moore , 2012] ) . For example , Geberl ( 2013 ) found non-simultaneous masking in Phyllostomus discolor for temporal separation between echoes up to 6 ms . Some theoretical mechanisms , e . g . ( Fontaine and Peremans , 2009; Matsuo et al . , 2004; Saillant et al . , 1993 ) , have been proposed that would allow bats to extract environment impulse responses from signals composed of multiple closely spaced echo signals . However , none of them have been unequivocally proven to be exploited by bats . Moreover , so far , these mechanisms have only been tested using simple artificially generated echo trains . To the best of our knowledge , no algorithm has proven to be able to reconstruct the impulse response of a realistically complex reflector such as vegetation . Grunwald et al . ( 2004 ) reported that bats can discriminate between echoes with different impulse response statistics . This shows that the auditory periphery of the bat retains sufficient information to allow responding to the stochastic properties of the underlying impulse responses . However , this does not necessarily imply that bats can reconstruct the impulse response from the echoes , which is required to be able to reconstruct the 3D layout of a scene from the echoes . In summary , inherent limitations of biosonar , including ( 1 ) the dependence on ambiguous spectral cues for both object localization and classification and ( 2 ) the finite temporal resolution of the auditory system , render it unlikely that an explicit 3D representation of a complex scene is available to a cruising bat – and that such a representation is used to recognize places . As the capacity for recognizing places is nevertheless a necessary requirement for any navigation strategy , we propose an alternative mechanism , taking into account these limitations , to explain how echolocating bats might navigate . Instead of attempting to reconstruct the position , shape and identity of objects from the cochlear output , we propose the cochlear output to be used directly , extending the template based approach described by Wiegrebe ( 2008 ) . Under this hypothesis , bats are assumed to match the output of the cochlea to a set of stored templates , i . e . , classifying the echo signature as one of a set of memorized echo signatures each one recorded at a previously visited place . This approach obviates the need for complex reconstruction algorithms extracting 3D spatial information from the echo signals at the two ears . As it uses the sensory input directly , our approach to place recognition is analogous to the view-based place recognition that is thought to underlie visual navigation in insects ( Zeil et al . , 2003; Franz and Mallot , 2000 ) . In addition to circumventing the computationally hard problem of deriving a 3D spatial representation from complex echo signals , echo templates have been shown to be very discriminative . Kuc ( 1997 ) showed a bio-mimetic sonar device to be capable of detecting which side of a coin was up using very simple echo templates . Their computational simplicity and discriminative power have led sonar based templates being used to recognize places in robotic navigation algorithms before , e . g . ( Mataric and Brooks , 1990; Steckel and Peremans , 2013; Kuipers , 2000 ) . However , to the best of our knowledge , no study has looked at the properties of sonar templates accessible to bats operating in complex habitats . Indeed , robotic studies using sonar templates have all been carried out in artificial man-made environments . Moreover , these studies have used emitters , receivers and processing methods that are not necessarily biologically plausible . For example , robots typically ( Kleeman and Kuc , 2008 ) use a ring of sonar ranging devices ( Mataric and Brooks , 1990; Kuipers , 2000 ) , each with a limited field of view ( Steckel and Peremans , 2012 ) , that extract the delay of the first echo . In this paper , using ensonification data , we derive templates from many echo trains from natural habitats . In contrast to most robotic studies , we collect and process the echo data in a biologically plausible way . Next , we assess the viability of our hypothesis by evaluating whether the derived templates are sufficient to support place recognition . Indeed , the viability of a template-based approach to place recognition depends on the following two properties of the templates: In this paper , we test whether these conditions are satisfied by collecting many cochlear templates as they could be perceived by bats . In the discussion , we argue that , by satisfying these two criteria , the templates can support navigation . In addition , we discuss how the templates could support the acquisition of a cognitive map . 2 Materials and methods A custom ensonification device consisting of 31 Knowles FG series microphones ( Steckel and Peremans , 2012 ) and a Senscomp ( http://www . senscomp . com/ultrasonic-sensors/series-7000-sensors . php ) Series 7000 ultrasonic speaker was used ( see Figure 2 ) . The speaker produces about 106 d⁢Bs⁢p⁢l at 50 kHz and 1 meter distance . The device was mounted on a pan tilt system ( PTU-E46 , FLIR , Goleta , CA ) allowing us to rotate the device from −150 to 150 degrees in azimuth and from −25 to 40 degrees in elevation . The pan tilt system moved the ensonification device through the full extent of its mechanical range in 31 steps of 10 degrees in azimuth and 7 steps of 10 . 8 degrees in elevation The positional error of the pan tilt system is less than 0 . 1 degrees . 10 . 7554/eLife . 14188 . 004Figure 2 . Close up of the ensonification device . At the front of the device the array of 31 microphones ( Knowles FG series ) can be seen . The Senscomp Series 7000 ultrasonic speaker is located above this array . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 14188 . 004 At each azimuth and elevation direction , three measurements were gathered . The data capture and storage was handled by a single-board computer integrated into the ensonification device . The single board computer controlling the data collection also controlled the pan tilt system through a serial interface cable . The single-board computer was wirelessly connected to a laptop enabling us to start and monitor the data collection . A hyperbolic frequency modulated pulse sweeping from 100 to 40 kHz in 1 ms was emitted . This frequency range was limited by the frequency response of the emitter and the electronics . The recording of the echoes was started at the onset of the emission and ends 34 ms later . The duration of the recording time window was limited by the on-board memory of the data acquisition system . The sampling rate was 219 kSamples/s . Data was collected at three different sites ( see Figure 3 ) . The structure of the data is depicted in Figure 3 . First , twelve positions in St . Andrews Park ( Bristol , UK , 51:27:15 . 772N , 2:36:52 . 996W ) were selected for ensonification . To ensure the data represented different densities of clutter bats might operate in , four open , four semi-cluttered and four cluttered locations were selected . The data collected at St . Andrews Park consisted of 7812 ( 12 positions × 217 directions × 3 repeats ) echo trains at each of the 31 microphones . Second , data was collected in a park in Midreshet Ben Gurion , Israel ( 30:50:53 . 318N , 34:46:54 . 174E ) . At this site , bats use an artificial corridor lined with boulders as part of their commuting route . In this corridor , the ensonification device was placed at 50 positions along a straight line spaced 20 cm apart . The line approximately ran along the centre of the corridor . At each of the 50 positions , three measurements for each of the 217 directions were collected yielding 32 , 550 echo trains ( 50 positions × 217 directions × 3 repeats ) at each of the 31 microphones . Finally , data was collected at Royal Fort Gardens ( Bristol , UK , 51:27:26 . 417N , 2:36:4 . 619W ) . At this third site , 40 positions spaced 25 cm apart along a 10 meter line were sampled yielding 26 , 040 echo trains ( 40 positions × 217 directions × 3 repeats ) at each of the 31 microphones . In total , 66 , 402 echo trains for each of the 31 microphones were used in this paper , resulting in a data set consisting of a total of 2 , 058 , 462 echo trains . 10 . 7554/eLife . 14188 . 005Figure 3 . Illustration of the data collected . Three data sets were collected ( corresponding with three field sites ) . First , at St Andrews park , the ensonification device was placed at twelve different locations in habitats with varying levels of clutter ( Open , Semi Cluttered , and Cluttered ) . At each of the twelve positions , echo trains from 217 azimuth and elevation directions were collected . At the Israel and Royal Fort Gardens site , the ensonification device was placed at 50 and 40 positions along a straight line , respectively . At each of the 50 ( spaced 20 cm apart ) or 40 ( spaced 25 cm apart ) positions , echo trains from 217 azimuth and elevation directions were collected . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 14188 . 005 At both St . Andrews park and the Israel site data was collected at an approximate height of about 3 meters . In the case of St . Andrews park , overhanging vegetation sometimes restricted the device to be raised to this level . If so , the device was raised as high as possible . In the Royal Fort Park , all data was collected at a height of about 2 meters . Templates were derived from the data collected at each of the three sites . The data for each of the 12 , 50 and 40 positions in each data set were processed in the same manner . The method used in constructing the templates is summarized in algorithm 1 . The classification performance was determined for templates obtained at the St Andrews site . Estimating the probability of correct classification requires the introduction of a noise model . We introduced both a noise floor and stochastic noise on the templates . 3 Results The probability of correct classification for each of the 217 directions for the 12 positions in the St . Andrews data set is plotted in Figure 6 . For the Open environments , the probability of correct classification was very low ( i . e . Pc∼0 ) . In contrast , for the Semi cluttered and the Cluttered environments the number of templates that could be recognized with a high probability increased . The fourth Semi cluttered environment was an outlier . The classification probabilities for this position were very low . Physically , this environment might have resembled an Open environment . The branches of the large coniferous tree , the major feature at this position , did not reach low enough for them to generate echoes . Figure 6 also depicts the angular error ei for each of the 217 directions in the 12 positions . These results mirror those for the probability of classification showing large errors in the open conditions and small errors in the cluttered positions . 10 . 7554/eLife . 14188 . 008Figure 6 . Template classification performance . Left: Panoramic views taken at the 12 positions . Middle: Probability ( Pc ) for each of the 12 St Andrews positions as a function of azimuth and elevation . right: Angular error ( ei ) for each of the 12 St Andrews positions as a function of azimuth and elevation . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 14188 . 008 In an additional analysis , we confirmed that only few confusions occurred between templates from different positions . This is , the probability Pc for a given template did not decrease markedly ( ΔPc¯∼0 . 01 ) when allowing for confusion between a given template ( corresponding to one position at one azimuth and elevation direction ) and templates taken from other positions ( at the same or at a different angle ) . 4 Discussion In this paper , we propose template based place recognition might underlie sonar-based navigation in bats . Under this hypothesis , bats would recognize places by remembering their echo signature - rather than their 3D layout . Using ensonification data , we assessed the viability of this alternative hypothesis regarding bat navigation by assessing two critical properties of the templates: ( 1 ) unique classification of templates and ( 2 ) template continuity . In the following , we discuss our findings regarding these two properties . The Royal Fort Gardens data set resulted in significantly smaller linear catchment distances ( Figures 8 , 9 , 11 ) . On the other hand , the average probability of correct classification was significantly higher in the Royal Fort Gardens data set ( Figure 1 ) . The difference in layout between the two sites can be appreciated from inspecting Figure 3 . The Israel site was a more open habitat than the Royal fort site , where the reflecting foliage was closer to the ensonification device than the rocks at the Royal fort site . In addition , the rocks at the Israel site ( in spite of being farther away ) resulted in stronger echoes than the foliage at the Royal fort site ( compare panels a & d in Figures 8 , 9 ) . The larger linear catchment distances for the Israel data suggests that navigation by means of templates is facilitated by ( strong ) echoes originating from distant reflectors . Distant reflectors move more slowly through the bat’s ’field of view’ , i . e . , they undergo a smaller degree of motion parallax . As our data shows , this results in templates with larger catchment distances . This might facilitate navigation . On the other hand , the Royal Fort Gardens data suggest that the higher motion parallax for closer reflectors results in a better template classification . Indeed , closer reflectors change more abruptly when moving through space . This seems to result in templates that are easier to classify – at the cost of smaller linear catchment distances . In short , our data reveals a trade-off between the linear catchment distance size and the probability of correct classification of a template . The existence of this trade-off is confirmed by the negative correlation we found between the linear catchment distance size and the probability of correct classification . Hence , our results suggest that navigating bats should maintain a preferred distance to foliage and other reflectors . Indeed , keeping a larger distance would reduce the average object motion parallax and result in larger linear catchment distances . On the other hand , keeping a larger distance would reduce the probability of correctly classifying templates . In addition , flying further away from objects will , in general , result in weaker echoes ( in our Israel data this effect has been offset by the strong echoes returned by the rocks ) . Therefore , our template theory of navigation predicts navigation would be facilitated by keeping a distance from reflectors that balances the opposing effects of motion parallax on the templates’ linear catchment distance and probability of correct classification . Whilst successful navigation does not require a map-like representation , e . g . ( Cruse and Wehner , 2011; Cheung et al . , 2014; Hesslow , 2012; Collett et al . , 2013 ) , it is likely that bats use some sort of cognitive map ( Geva-Sagiv et al . , 2015 ) . However , to the best of our knowledge , the use of such a map has not been demonstrated experimentally ( Holland , 2007 ) . Nevertheless , indirect evidence for the existence of a cognitive map , integrating echolocation information if available , is the finding of grid and place cells in bats ( Yartsev et al . , 2011; Yartsev and Ulanovsky , 2013 ) and bats’ ability to remember flight routes in a completely dark room ( Barchi et al . , 2013 ) . Building and maintaining a cognitive map based on sonar templates would require the successful completion of three subtasks: ( 1 ) exploring the environment and building a library of templates , ( 2 ) integrating the templates into a map-like representation , ( 3 ) deriving motor plans from this representation that take the bat from its current location to a desired position . So far , knowledge about how bats could address these challenges is very sparse . However , work has begun on each of these components . Below , we review this work and outline a potential strategy for constructing a cognitive map using the templates as proposed in this paper . In this paper , we have proposed that bats recognize places by remembering their echo signature - rather than their 3D layout . It could be argued that , since bats have been shown to be capable of recognizing objects , they could very well use that same capability to recognize scenes based on the 3D object layout . However , we would like to point out that the behaviour of bats in recognition experiments differs from that of cruising/navigating bats . In recognition experiments , bats typically ensonify the same object from different directions as part of an active object-centred exploration process , e . g . ( Genzel et al . , 2012; Geipel et al . , 2013; Simon et al . , 2006 ) . Cruising/navigating bats , on the other hand , fly by objects along their flight path resulting in a more accidental , i . e . less object-centred , and less extensive series of observations of those objects . Such a fly-by mode of echolocation is well suited to the proposed template-based strategy as it requires local ’snapshots’ only . Also , we would like to argue that even in the object recognition experiments bats might not be building a 3D reconstruction of the object . They might instead be looking for diagnostic acoustic cues , e . g . spectral cues as hypothesized in the study by Simon et al . ( 2006 ) . Such an account of object recognition would be easily integrated with our template-based account of place recognition . One possible way the two might interact is that the template-based place descriptors would be used to build a map first and then later ( or possibly in parallel ) ’landmarks’ , i . e . uniquely identified objects , would be associated with places on the map . Hence , while we agree that a 3D place description -were it to exist- would be more general and easier to change , we believe it still remains to be proven that such a description is actually built by bats in a navigation context . Indeed , it is our hypothesis that bats would be driven towards an alternative , template based , mechanism either by the inability of their sonar systems to reconstruct a 3D layout of the environment or , if a 3D layout of the environment could be inferred from the echoes , by the associated much higher computational burden placed upon their limited cognitive resources . To produce direct evidence that would allow choosing between the two alternatives , we suggest future experiments might be set up to test the prediction by the template based place recognition mechanism advocated here that bats would not be able to distinguish between scenes if their 3D layout is different while their resulting template is similar . Therefore , behavioural evidence in favour of our approach would consist of bats failing to distinguish complex scenes giving rise to many echoes , i . e . with a similar complexity of their natural habitats , that result in the same template , essentially a low-pass filtered range-intensity profile . To test this , one could generate echoes from a complex virtual scene and its mirror image . These should result in the same template whereas a 3D model account predicts bats should be able to distinguish between the two scenes . Alternatively and possibly more straightforward to test , the 3D model account predicts bats would be able to recognize echoes coming from rotated versions of the same underlying scene . The template approach predicts that bats would be unable to make such generalizations for larger rotations , i . e . once the measured template would fall outside the catchment area of the stored template ."}
{"doi": "elife-57127-v2", "abstract": "PI3K-related kinases ( PIKKs ) are large Serine/Threonine ( Ser/Thr ) -protein kinases central to the regulation of many fundamental cellular processes . PIKK family member SMG1 orchestrates progression of an RNA quality control pathway , termed nonsense-mediated mRNA decay ( NMD ) , by phosphorylating the NMD factor UPF1 . Phosphorylation of UPF1 occurs in its unstructured N- and C-terminal regions at Serine/Threonine-Glutamine ( SQ ) motifs . How SMG1 and other PIKKs specifically recognize SQ motifs has remained unclear . Here , we present a cryo-electron microscopy ( cryo-EM ) reconstruction of a human SMG1-8-9 kinase complex bound to a UPF1 phosphorylation site at an overall resolution of 2 . 9 Å . This structure provides the first snapshot of a human PIKK with a substrate-bound active site . Together with biochemical assays , it rationalizes how SMG1 and perhaps other PIKKs specifically phosphorylate Ser/Thr-containing motifs with a glutamine residue at position +1 and a hydrophobic residue at position -1 , thus elucidating the molecular basis for phosphorylation site recognition .", "plain language summary": "The instructions for producing proteins in the cell are copied from DNA to molecules known as messenger RNA . If there is an error in the messenger RNA , this causes incorrect proteins to be produced that could potentially kill the cell . Cells have a special detection system that spots and removes any messenger RNA molecules that contain errors , which would result in the protein produced being too short . For this error-detecting system to work , a protein called UPF1 must be modified by an enzyme called SMG1 . This enzyme only binds to and modifies the UPF1 protein at sites that contain a specific pattern of amino acids – the building blocks that proteins are made from . However , it remained unclear how SMG1 recognizes this pattern and interacts with UPF1 . Now , Langer et al . have used a technique known as cryo-electron microscopy to image human SMG1 bound to a segment of UPF1 . These images were then used to generate the three-dimensional structure of how the two proteins interact . This high-resolution structure showed that protein building blocks called leucine , serine and glutamine are the recognized pattern of amino acids . To further understand the role of the amino acids , Langer et al . replaced them one-by-one with different amino acids to see how each affected the interaction between the two proteins . This revealed that SMG1 preferred leucine at the beginning of the recognized pattern and glutamine at the end when binding to UPF1 . SMG1 is member of an important group of enzymes that are involved in various error detecting systems . This is the first time that a protein from this family has been imaged together with its target and these findings may also be relevant to other enzymes in this family . Furthermore , the approach used to determine the structure of SMG1 and the structural information itself could also be used in drug design to improve the accuracy with which drugs identify their targets .", "article": "1 Introduction Family members of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinases ( PIKKs ) activate distinct signaling pathways that promote cellular survival in different environmental and endogenous stress conditions ( Baretić and Williams , 2014; Imseng et al . , 2018; Lempiäinen and Halazonetis , 2009 ) . Specifically , PIKKs oversee translation machinery in the cytoplasm ( mTOR , SMG1 ) , or regulate DNA damage repair in the nucleus ( ATM , ATR and DNA-PK ) ( Shimobayashi and Hall , 2014; Saxton and Sabatini , 2017; Yamashita , 2013; Yamashita et al . , 2001; Blackford and Jackson , 2017; Elías-Villalobos et al . , 2019 ) . With the exception of the enzymatically inactive TRAPP/Tra1 , which serves as a scaffold in chromatin modification complexes , all other members of the PIKK family are Ser/Thr-protein kinases , and are among the largest proteins in the eukaryotic kinome . Recent publications have revealed the organization of PIKK active sites at better than 4 Å resolution ( Gat et al . , 2019; Zhu et al . , 2019; Yang et al . , 2013; Jansma et al . , 2020; Yates et al . , 2020 ) , but the key question of how members of this kinase family recognize their substrates remains unanswered . Human SMG1 is one of the largest PIKK family members ( ~410 kDa ) and plays a crucial role in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay ( NMD ) , a conserved pathway that regulates mRNA stability in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells ( Kurosaki and Maquat , 2016; Karousis and Mühlemann , 2019 ) . In its canonical surveillance function , the NMD pathway recognizes and degrades aberrant mRNAs containing premature translation termination codons , thus preventing the accumulation of truncated protein products . In addition , NMD also regulates the levels of a subset of normal , physiological transcripts , amounting to 5–10% of the transcriptome . In metazoans , SMG1 forms a stable complex with two additional proteins , SMG8 and SMG9 , and specifically phosphorylates the RNA helicase UPF1 . Phosphorylation of UPF1 is a crucial event in this pathway as it enables the recruitment of downstream NMD factors SMG5 , SMG6 and SMG7 , leading to ribonucleolytic cleavage of the RNA . SMG1 phosphorylates UPF1 specifically at Ser/Thr - Gln ( SQ ) motifs present in the unstructured N- and C-terminal regions that flank the helicase core ( Yamashita et al . , 2001; Denning et al . , 2001 ) . Specificity for a glutamine residue at the +1 position is shared by other PIKK family members , namely , ATM , ATR and DNA-PK kinases ( Kim et al . , 1999; Bannister et al . , 1993 ) . However , there is an additional layer of phosphorylation site specification . Among the 20 possible SQ motifs in UPF1 , studies in vitro and in vivo have shown that only a selected few are effectively phosphorylated , including Ser1073 , Ser1078 , Ser1096 and Ser1116 ( Yamashita et al . , 2001; Ohnishi et al . , 2003; Durand et al . , 2016 ) . Interestingly , these UPF1 phosphorylation sites share a Leu-Ser-Gln ( LSQ ) consensus sequence identical to the LSQ consensus motif identified in substrates of the ATM kinase ( O'Neill et al . , 2000; Kim et al . , 1999 ) . In this work , we studied the interaction between recombinant human SMG1-SMG8-SMG9 with UPF1 peptides using cryo-EM and mass spectrometry to identify the molecular basis with which SMG1 , and potentially other PIKKs , recognizes specific phosphorylation sites in its substrate . 2 Results and discussion We used stably transfected HEK293T cells to express and purify a human wild-type SMG1-8-9 complex , as previously reported ( Gat et al . , 2019 ) . The complex phosphorylated full-length recombinant UPF1 in a radioactive kinase assay ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1A ) , confirming the enzymatic activity of purified SMG1 towards its physiological substrate . We selected a frequently phosphorylated site within UPF1 ( Yamashita et al . , 2001 ) , Ser1078 , and used a peptide spanning residues 1074–1084 ( hereby defined as UPF1-LSQ ) for subsequent structural and biochemical analysis ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1B ) . We confirmed the ability of SMG1-8-9 to specifically phosphorylate UPF1-LSQ using a mass spectrometry-based phosphorylation assay ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1C and D ) . This assay allowed us to monitor the relative amount of phosphorylation of a specific peptide over time . As a control , phosphorylation was abolished when Ser1078 was changed to Asp ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1C and D ) . Hence , the reconstitutions used in this study recapitulate specific phosphorylation site selection . For structure determination , we incubated SMG1-8-9 with UPF1-LSQ and AMPPNP , a non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue , and subjected the sample to cryo-EM single particle analysis . The final reconstruction reached an overall resolution of 2 . 9 Å ( Figure 1—figure supplements 2 and 3 ) , and allowed us to further complete and refine the published model for SMG1-8-9 ( Supplementary file 1; Gat et al . , 2019 ) . Briefly , SMG1 consists of an N-terminal solenoid 'arch' and a compact C-terminal 'head' region ( Figure 1A and B ) . The C-terminal 'head' is formed by the tight interaction between the catalytic module , typical of Ser/Thr-kinases , and the so-called FAT and FATC domains ( Imseng et al . , 2018; Baretić and Williams , 2014; Bosotti et al . , 2000 ) . The N-terminal ‘arch’ provides binding sites for both SMG8 and SMG9 ( Figure 1A and B ) . As we had previously reported , SMG9 contains an unusual G-fold domain that binds ATP rather than GTP or GDP ( Gat et al . , 2019 ) . The local resolution of around 3 Å allowed us to model SMG9-bound ATP in the reconstructed density , revealing the molecular basis for how the adenosine nucleotide is recognized by this unusual G-fold domain ( Figure 1B and D , Figure 1—figure supplement 4 ) . Briefly , the G4 and G5 motifs responsible for the recognition of the base have rearranged to preferentially bind an adenine base rather than a guanine ( Figure 1—figure supplement 4 ) . Importantly , compared to the previously published apo-SMG1-8-9 structure ( Gat et al . , 2019 ) , the current reconstruction revealed extra density in the kinase active site accounting for both AMPPNP and UPF1-LSQ ( Figure 1B and C , Figure 1—figure supplement 5A , B and C ) . The active site of SMG1 shows excellent density for residues 1075–1081 of UPF1-LSQ ( Figure 1C , Figure 1—figure supplement 5 ) . The directionality of the bound substrate peptide is consistent with that of other kinase structures , such as CDK2 , and the arrangement of key active site residues is well conserved ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1; Bao et al . , 2011 ) . The geometry of the catalytic loop ( residues 2332 to 2340 ) and of the activation segment ( residues 2352 to 2375 ) in the SMG1 kinase domain as well as orientation of important active site residues are very similar to those observed in mTOR ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1B ) , indicative of an active kinase state ( Yang et al . , 2013 ) . Specific recognition of the phosphorylation site is achieved via conserved residues contributed by the activation segment and the catalytic loop as well as by the FATC domain ( Figure 2 ) . The hydroxyl group of Ser1078 , the phospho-acceptor residue in UPF1-LSQ , is positioned by residues of the catalytic loop , in particular Asp2335 and His2337 ( Figure 2B and C , Figure 2—figure supplement 2A and B ) . Consistent with the structural observations , mutation of either of the corresponding residues in SMG1 , mTOR and other protein kinases results in catalytically inactive enzyme ( Bao et al . , 2011; Madhusudan et al . , 2002; Yang et al . , 2013; Brown et al . , 1995; Yamashita et al . , 2001; Denning et al . , 2001 ) . Therefore , the overall architecture of the substrate-bound SMG1 catalytic module corroborates the structural conservation among PIKK active sites and reveals that positioning of the substrate phospho-acceptor is achieved by residues that are shared between a wide range of protein kinases . A glutamine residue following the phospho-acceptor site is the minimal requirement for UPF1 phosphorylation by SMG1 ( Figure 3A; Yamashita et al . , 2001 ) . To validate the importance of this residue , we performed a mass spectrometry-based phosphorylation assay using a series of peptides based on UPF1-LSQ . We changed the residue at position +1 in the UPF1-LSQ peptide to test the effect of different side chain properties on phosphorylation . Only wildtype UPF1-LSQ was efficiently phosphorylated by SMG1 ( Figure 3B and Figure 1—figure supplement 1C ) . In our structure , the glutamine at position +1 of UPF1-LSQ reaches into a hydrophobic cage formed by the SMG1 activation segment and FATC domain ( Figure 3C ) . In particular , UPF1 Gln1079 stacks against Tyr3654 and Leu2365 and forms hydrogen bonds with the backbone of Val2367 ( Figure 3C ) . The hydrophobic cage is highly conserved in other PIKKs that recognize SQ motifs ( ATM , ATR and DNA-PK ) but is different in mTOR ( where Glu2369 is found at the equivalent position of SMG1 Leu2365 ) ( Figure 3D ) . This difference is also apparent from the superposition of SMG1 with the 2 . 8 Å resolution structure of the ATM orthologue Chaetomium thermophilum ( Ct ) Tel1ATM and with mTOR ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1C and D; Jansma et al . , 2020; Yang et al . , 2013 ) . While the geometry of the hydrophobic cage is highly similar between SMG1 and CtTel1ATM , it deviates in mTOR due to the described Leu to Glu substitution . Indeed , mTOR has been found to prefer small or non-polar residues at position +1 of its phosphorylation consensus motif ( Hsu et al . , 2011 ) . Taken together , these observations provide a rationale for the difference in phosphorylation site specificity between SMG1 , ATM , ATR , DNA-PK and mTOR . Intriguingly , the structural superposition with CtTel1ATM shows that its PIKK regulatory domain ( PRD ) places a Gln residue in the corresponding hydrophobic cage , effectively occupying the substrate Gln binding site ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1C ) . This explains the autoinhibitory function of the ATM PRD domain ( Jansma et al . , 2020; Yates et al . , 2020 ) . The corresponding PRD domain in SMG1 is a ~ 1100 amino-acid long insertion ( Figure 1A ) that negatively impacts its kinase activity ( Deniaud et al . , 2015 ) . However , there is no ordered density for this region in neither the previous apo-structure ( Gat et al . , 2019 ) nor in the current substrate-bound structure ( Figure 1A and B ) . Previous results have indicated that SQ motifs preceded by a hydrophobic residue in position −1 are preferentially phosphorylated by SMG1 ( Yamashita et al . , 2001 ) . In our model , the Leu residue at position −1 in the substrate forms a C-H⋅⋅⋅π-interaction with SMG1 Phe2215 and is further stabilized by hydrophobic interactions with SMG1 Pro2249 and Gly3656 . The binding pocket is also restricted by the catalytic loop residues His2337 and Asp2339 ( Figure 4A ) . To biochemically characterize the importance of position −1 , we assayed a peptide library based on UPF1-LSQ , in which we varied the residue in position −1 to represent all those found in the 20 different SQ motifs of human UPF1 . Following phosphorylation of the peptides over time , we could observe that SQ motifs carrying a hydrophobic residue in position −1 were more efficiently phosphorylated . Notably , a Leu elicited the highest phosphorylation rate ( Figure 4B ) . An end-point measurement experiment using single peptides confirmed these observations ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) . We conclude that a Leu at position −1 is optimal for the interaction with SMG1 at the structural level . This is reflected at the biochemical level , whereby decreasing hydrophobicity of the residue at the −1 position negatively affects phosphorylation efficiency . Interestingly , further analysis of the final time points in the time course phosphorylation experiment showed that the SQ motifs that carry rather hydrophobic residues at the −1 position ( and are therefore more efficiently phosphorylated ) reside exclusively in the UPF1 C-terminus ( Figure 4C , Figure 4—figure supplement 2 ) . To validate our hypothesis on the importance of position −1 hydrophobicity , we turned to a known phosphorylation site in the N-terminus , Thr28 . We tested whether SMG1-8-9 phosphorylation activity toward this motif could be enhanced by changing the residue at position −1 from the naturally occurring Asp to a Leu . Indeed , mutating the residue upstream of this SQ motif ( Asp27Leu ) resulted in a gain-of-function effect in the phosphorylation assay ( Figure 4D ) . These findings are in agreement with data for ATM and ATR ( Kim et al . , 1999 ) , although the residues involved in the recognition of UPF1 Leu1077 have diverged , suggesting that the details of −1 recognition will differ in other PIKKs . Finally , we do not observe extensive interactions between SMG1 and the peptide residues preceding or following the LSQ motif in our structure . Consistently , we did not detect a marked effect on phosphorylation in a time course experiment where we changed the residue at position +2 of UPF1-LSQ ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1B ) . In this manuscript , we report the first structure of a substrate-bound PIKK active site , thereby revealing the basis for phosphorylation site selection by SMG1 and other PIKK family members . The results elucidate the mechanism of phospho-acceptor recognition , and explain the specificity for Ser-containing substrates with a glutamine downstream residue at position +1 and an upstream hydrophobic residue at position −1 ( particularly Leu ) . These findings can be extrapolated to other PIKK members , such as ATM and ATR , and suggest a specific mechanism for PRD function by acting as a pseudosubstrate . Our results provide molecular insights into a key step of the NMD pathway . Whether phosphorylation of full-length UPF1 by SMG1 involves additional elements of recognition and/or additional levels of regulation will be a subject for future studies . 3 Materials and methods The SMG1-SMG8-SMG9 complex was expressed and purified as previously described ( Gat et al . , 2019 ) . Briefly , a pool of HEK293T cells ( obtained from ATCC ) stably expressing full length SMG1 ( N-terminally fused to a TwinStrep-tag and a 3C protease cleavage site ) , SMG8 and SMG9 was established using the piggybac method by initially transfecting the cells using polyethylenimine ( Yusa et al . , 2011; Li et al . , 2013 ) . The source cells were authenticated by genotyping ( Eurofins ) and tested negative for mycoplasma contamination ( LookOut Mycoplasma PCR Detection Kit , Sigma-Aldrich ) . For SMG1-SMG8-SMG9 expression , cultures were adjusted to a density of 1 × 106 cells per mL in FreeStyle 293 Expression Medium ( Gibco , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . The cells were induced by addition of doxycycline and were harvested 48 hr after induction . After lysis by douncing the cells in 1xPBS , 1 mM MgCl2 and 1 mM DTT supplemented with DNase I , Benzonase and EDTA-free cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail ( Roche ) the cleared lysate was applied to a StrepTrap HP column ( Sigma-Aldrich ) and the complex affinity purified using the N-terminal TwinStrep-tag on SMG1 . After washing with 50 column volumes of 1xPBS , 1 mM MgCl2 and 1 mM DTT the complex was eluted using wash buffer supplemented with 2 . 5 mM desthiobiotin . SMG1-8-9 was further purified by size-exclusion chromatography using a Superose 6 Increase 10/300 GL column ( Sigma-Aldrich ) equilibrated with 1xPBS , 1 mM MgCl2 and 1 mM DTT ( Aekta purifier FPLC system , GE Healthcare ) . Purified SMG1-8-9 was concentrated up to 6 μM and stored in gel filtration buffer . To obtain full-length unphosphorylated human UPF1 , the protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 STAR ( DE3 ) pRARE fused to a C-terminal 6xHis-tag cleavable with Tobacco etch virus ( TEV ) protease , as described before ( Chakrabarti et al . , 2011; Chakrabarti et al . , 2014 ) . Bacteria were grown at 37°C in TB medium shaking at 180 rpm and induced using IPTG at an OD of 2 for overnight expression at 18°C . Harvested bacteria ( 6000 rpm , 10 min ) were lysed by sonication in lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris-Cl pH 7 . 5 , 500 mM NaCl , 10 mM Imidazole , 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol , 10% ( v/v ) glycerol , 2 mM MgCl2 and 0 . 2% ( v/v ) NP-40 ) supplemented with DNase I and EDTA-free cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail ( Roche ) . The lysate was cleared by centrifugation ( 25 . 000 rpm , 30 min ) , filtered and combined with TALON resin ( Takara ) equilibrated with lysis buffer for gravity-flow affinity purification . After washing with 70 column volumes of lysis buffer , the protein was eluted with lysis buffer supplemented with 300 mM imidazole pH 7 . 5 and the eluate was combined with His-tagged TEV protease and dialyzed overnight against 20 mM HEPES pH 7 . 5 , 85 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl2 , 10% ( v/v ) glycerol and 2 mM DTT . The dialyzed sample was passed over another TALON column by gravity-flow , in order to separate cleaved protein from the cleaved-off His-tag , the His-tagged TEV protease and uncleaved UPF1 protein . The flow-through of this column contained cleaved UPF1 and was loaded on a HiTrap Heparin HP column ( GE Healthcare ) . Following binding and washing with Heparin buffer A ( as for dialysis ) , UPF1 was eluted by a gradient increasing salt concentration from 85 mM to 500 mM over 50 column volumes ( Aekta prime FPLC system , GE Healthcare ) . The peak corresponding to full-length UPF1 was pooled and concentrated before a final sizing step using a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column ( Sigma-Aldrich ) equilibrated with Heparin buffer A ( Aekta purifier FPLC system , GE Healthcare ) . Purified full-length UPF1 was pooled and concentrated up to 30 μM using an Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter ( 50 kDa MWCO , Merck ) . All described protein purification steps were carried out at 4°C and all purified proteins were flash frozen in size-exclusion buffer using liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C until further usage . A sample of 0 . 5 μM ( final concentration ) purified SMG1-SMG8-SMG9 was mixed with 0 . 5 mM of UPF1-LSQ , 1 mM AMPPNP , 2 mM MgCl2 , 2 mM DTT and 0 . 04% ( v/v ) n-octyl-beta-D-glucoside in 1xPBS and incubated for 30 min on ice . The UPF1-LSQ peptide ( sequence: QPELSQDSYLG ) was synthesized in-house as described for the mass spectrometry-based phosphorylation assay . A 4 μL sample was applied to a glow-discharged Quantifoil R1 . 2/1 . 3 , Cu 200 mesh grid and incubated for 30 s at 4°C and approximately 100% humidity . Grids were subsequently plunge frozen directly after blotting using a liquid ethane/propane ( 37% ethane , temperature range when plunging: −170°C to −180°C ) mixture and a ThermoFisher FEI Vitrobot IV set to a blot time of 3 . 5 s and a blot force of 4 . Cryo-EM data were collected using a ThermoFisher FEI Titan Krios microscope operated at 300 kV equipped with a post-column GIF ( energy width 20 eV ) and a Gatan K3 camera operated in counting mode , the SerialEM software suite , and a beam-tilt based multi-shot acquisition scheme . Movies were recorded at a nominal magnification of 81 . 000x corresponding to a pixel size of 1 . 094 Å at the specimen level . The sample was imaged with a total exposure of 68 . 75 e-/Å2 evenly spread over 5 . 5 s and 79 frames . The target defocus during data collection ranged between −0 . 8 and −2 . 9 μm . Data processing was carried out using RELION 3 . 0 ( Zivanov et al . , 2018 ) unless stated otherwise . Beam-induced sample motions were corrected and dose-weighting was carried out using the RELION implementation of MotionCor2 ( Zheng et al . , 2017 ) . Particles were picked using Gautomatch ( https://www . mrc-lmb . cam . ac . uk/kzhang/Gautomatch/ ) and CTF estimation was done using the RELION wrapper for CtfFind4 . 1 ( Rohou and Grigorieff , 2015 ) . After extraction ( box size: 320 pix , 1 . 094 Å/pix ) and downsampling ( box size: 80 pix , 4 . 376 Å/pix ) , 4 , 368 , 586 particles were submitted to two rounds of reference-free 2D classification . A subset of the cleaned candidate particles was used to generate an initial model using CryoSPARC v2 ( Punjani et al . , 2017 ) . 1 , 524 , 355 selected particles were 3D classified before re-extracting 886 , 714 particles with original sampling followed by two additional rounds of 3D classification resulting in 481 , 754 final particles . All classification steps were carried out with the total amount of particles being distributed over multiple batches . After 3D auto-refinement , sharpening ( b-factor = −119 . 5 ) and Ctf refinement in RELION 3 . 0 , the final refined map ( 3D auto-refinement ) was again submitted to RELIONs’ post-processing routine for automatic B-factor weighting and high-resolution noise substitution ( b-factor = −102 . 6 ) . The final reconstruction ( EMD-11063 ) reached an overall resolution of 2 . 9 Å with local resolution ranging from 2 . 8 Å to 4 . 5 Å as estimated by RELION 3 . 0 . The reconstructed density was interpreted using COOT ( version 1 . 0 ) and our previously published model of SMG1-8-9 ( PDB: 6SYT ) ( Emsley et al . , 2010 ) . Model building was iteratively interrupted by real-space refinements using PHENIX ( version 1 . 17 ) ( Adams et al . , 2010; Liebschner et al . , 2019 ) . Statistics assessing the quality of the final model ( PDB ID 6Z3R ) were generated using Molprobity ( Chen et al . , 2010; Supplementary file 1 ) . FSC curves were calculated using PHENIX and the 3D FSC online application ( Tan et al . , 2017 ) . Images of the calculated density and the built model were prepared using UCSF Chimera ( Pettersen et al . , 2004 ) , UCSF ChimeraX ( Goddard et al . , 2018 ) and PyMOL ( version 2 . 3 . 2 ) . In vitro kinase assays were essentially carried out as before ( Gat et al . , 2019 ) . 1 μM of full-length UPF1 was mixed with 50 nM SMG1-8-9 , 10mM MgCl2 and 2mM DTT in 1xPBS . The reaction was started by adding 0 . 5mM ATP and 0 . 06 μM of γ-32P-labeled ATP . The reaction was incubated at 30°C and samples were taken at different time points to follow phosphorylation over time . The samples were immediately quenched by adding SDS-containing sample buffer and initially analyzed by SDS gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie-staining . Phosphoproteins were subsequently detected using autoradiography and a Typhoon FLA7000 imager ( GE Healthcare ) . All peptides were synthesized in-house using solid-phase peptide synthesis and the quality of the product was assessed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry ( ESI MS ) . For the purpose of this study , peptides were dissolved in 1xPBS supplemented with 500 mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 . Two types of experiments were carried out . Firstly , several peptides ( typically comprising a library ) and a control were mixed , and their individual phosphorylation ratios were determined at several time points ( 0 , 10 , 20 , 40 and 80 min ) . Secondly , one end-point measurement experiment was carried out . In this setup , a single peptide was mixed with a control and the relative phosphorylation ratio was determined at a single , final time point ( 80 min ) . This type of experiment was used to assess whether effects on phosphorylation ratios observed in time course assays are caused by competition between several peptides for SMG1 binding . In both cases , 0 . 5 μM of kinase complex was combined with 0 . 1 mM of each peptide , 0 . 5 mM ATP , 20 mM MgCl2 and 2 mM DTT in 1xPBS . The reaction was started by addition of kinase and incubated at 30°C . Samples were taken at desired time points and immediately quenched after collection by adding EDTA to a final concentration of 50 mM on ice . In order to remove kinase complex and transfer the peptides into a compatible buffer , we made use of home-made StageTips ( Rappsilber et al . , 2007 ) . Poly ( styrenedivinylbenzene ) copolymer ( SDB-XC ) was washed with methanol by centrifugation before being washed again with buffer B ( 0 . 1% ( v/v ) formic acid , 80% ( v/v ) acetonitrile ) . Buffer A ( 0 . 1% ( v/v ) formic acid ) was used for equilibration of the SDB-XC material . Following sorbent equilibration , the sample was applied and the tips were washed using buffer A . Finally , the sample was eluted using buffer B . Using an Agilent 1290 HPLC , typically about 5 μL of the sample in 70% ( v/v ) acetonitrile and 0 . 05% ( v/v ) trifluoroacetic acid were flow-injected ( 250 μL/min ) into a Bruker maXis II ETD mass spectrometer for ESI MS time-of-flight analysis . Peptides were ionized at a capillary voltage of 4500 V and an end plate offset of 500 V . Full scan MS spectra ( 200–1600 m/z ) were acquired at a spectra rate of 1 Hz and a collision energy of 10 eV . All experiments were carried out as independent experimental triplicates . Raw data files were processed using Bruker Compass DataAnalysis software . The m/z spectra were deconvoluted by maximum entropy with an instrument resolving power of 10 , 000 . The 12C peaks corresponding to individual peptides were identified in the resulting neutral spectra and integrated , both for masses accounting for unphosphorylated and phosphorylated peptides . To calculate a relative phosphorylation ratio , the area for phosphorylated peptide was divided by the sum of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated peptide . All time points were normalized to time point 0 . Means of independent experimental triplicates and error bars indicating standard deviations were visualized using Prism ( GraphPad ) ."}

A protein called mTOR sits at the core of a signaling pathway that integrates these and other sources information . Problems with the mTOR pathway contribute to several diseases including diabetes and cancer . The mTOR protein occurs in two distinct protein complexes , called mTORC1 and mTORC2 . These complexes contain a mix of other proteins – known as accessory proteins . They also sense different cues and act upon distinct targets in the cell . Recent research reported the structure of mTORC1 , which provided clues about how this complex works . Yet , much less was known about the mTORC2 complex . Stuttfeld , Aylett et al . have now used a technique called cryo-electron microscopy to reveal the three-dimensional architecture of the human version of mTORC2 . Comparing the new mTORC2 structure to the existing one for mTORC1 showed that they have many features in common but important differences too . The overall shape of both complexes is similar and each complex contains two copies of mTOR arranged in a similar way . Also , the main accessory proteins in each complex interact with almost the exact same parts of mTOR , but the accessory proteins in mTORC2 are organized differently from those of mTORC1 . The different accessory proteins also have distinct shapes . These differences could help to explain why the complexes respond to different cues and recognize different targets . These new findings provide an entry point for further studies on how mTORC2 works in cells . The next step is to get a higher resolution image of the structure of this complex to see the finer details of all the components .

Originally identified in yeast as TOR ( Heitman et al . , 1991; Kunz et al . , 1993 ) , the mammalian orthologue mTOR senses a range of cellular cues , including nutrient and energy availability , and growth factor signals , to control metabolism and autophagy ( Laplante and Sabatini , 2012; Loewith and Hall , 2011; Saxton and Sabatini , 2017 ) . Due to its role as a central controller of cell growth , aberrant mTOR signaling is observed in major diseases ( Dazert and Hall , 2011; Saxton and Sabatini , 2017 ) . mTOR is a member of the phosphatidylinositol-kinase-related kinase ( PIKK ) family ( Keith and Schreiber , 1995 ) and exerts its function as the enzymatic component of two distinct protein complexes , mTOR complex ( mTORC ) one and mTORC2 . Together with the small protein mLST8 , mTOR forms the core of both complexes ( Kim et al . , 2003; Loewith et al . , 2002 ) . The protein Raptor is unique to mTORC1 ( Hara et al . , 2002; Kim et al . , 2002 ) , whereas the proteins Rictor and SIN1 are defining subunits of mTORC2 ( Frias et al . , 2006; Jacinto et al . , 2006; Jacinto et al . , 2004; Sarbassov et al . , 2004; Yang et al . , 2006 ) . Additionally , Protor-1/2 and Deptor can bind to mTORC2 ( Pearce et al . , 2007; Peterson et al . , 2009 ) . The polyketide rapamycin , in complex with the endogenous protein FKBP12 , inhibits mTORC1 activity by binding the FKBP-rapamycin ( FRB ) domain of mTOR ( Aylett et al . , 2016; Yang et al . , 2013 ) . In contrast , the FKBP-rapamycin complex is unable to bind mTORC2 ( Jacinto et al . , 2004 ) , although prolonged rapamycin treatment disrupts mTORC2 signaling by preventing mTOR incorporation into mTORC2 ( Lamming et al . , 2012; Sarbassov et al . , 2006 ) . mTORC2 is activated by growth factors , in particular through the insulin/PI3K signaling pathway ( Saxton and Sabatini , 2017 ) . The major substrates of mTORC2 are the AGC-kinase family members Akt , SGK-1 and PKC-α ( García-Martínez and Alessi , 2008; Ikenoue et al . , 2008; Sarbassov et al . , 2005 ) . Biochemical analysis has revealed that mTORCs form dimeric assemblies ( Wullschleger et al . , 2005 ) . The architecture of mTORC1 was resolved only recently through the use of cryo-EM and X-ray crystallography ( Aylett et al . , 2016; Yang et al . , 2016 ) . However , although biochemical analysis and a 26 Å EM reconstruction of yeast TORC2 have suggested that TOR and Lst8 form the same dimeric core as observed in mTORC1 ( Gaubitz et al . , 2015; Wullschleger et al . , 2005 ) , higher resolution information on the mTORC2 assembly remains unavailable . Structural data on mTORC2 accessory proteins are restricted to the fission yeast Sin1 CRIM domain ( Tatebe et al . , 2017 ) and the SIN1 PH domains ( Pan and Matsuura , 2012 ) . 2 Results and discussion We co-expressed the core components of human mTORC2; mTOR , mLST8 , Rictor , SIN1 and Protor-1 , in Spodoptera frugiperda cells using the MultiBac system ( Fitzgerald et al . , 2006 ) . Expression was attained for all components , and mTORC2 was captured by affinity to a FLAG tag inserted in the amino-terminal HEAT repeats of mTOR . Reconstituted complexes were purified by size-exclusion chromatography ( SEC ) . Yields remained low ( ~0 . 1 nmol complex per 10 L culture ) , as mTORC2 proved labile over the course of purification , resulting in two major species of mTOR complexes eluting from SEC; mTOR-mLST8 alone and reconstituted mTORC2 complex comprising mTOR , mLST8 , Rictor , SIN1 and substoichiometric amounts of Protor-1 , as confirmed by mass spectrometry ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . Human mTORC2 demonstrated kinase activity towards the substrate Akt-1 ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . mTORC2 also proved extremely labile during sample preparation for both negative staining ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ) and cryo-electron microscopy ( cryo-EM ) . Stabilisation of human mTORC2 , by cross-linking with glutaraldehyde using a modified gradient fixation protocol , allowed us to visualise intact , rhombic complexes . We collected cryo-EM data from stabilised samples , yielding 94 953 mTOR-dimer-containing particles for single particle analysis ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3 ) . Due to the labile nature of the complex , we observed intact complexes only in thicker ice , which limited the achievable contrast . Single particle reconstruction of mTORC2 proceeded from both an ab initio model generated from negatively stained samples and from the prior structure of the Kluyveromyces marxianus TOR-Lst8 complex ( Baretić et al . , 2016 ) , yielding essentially identical results . A reconstruction of non-cross-linked mTORC2 from negatively stained grids agrees well with the cryo-EM reconstructions of cross-linked mTORC2 indicating that the cross-linking procedure preserves the native structure of the complex ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ) . mTORC2 proved heterogeneous; refinement initiated from the K . m . TOR-Lst8 reference yielded classes encompassing free mTOR-mLST8 ( 30% ) , mTOR-mLST8 occupied on a single flank by accessory protein ( 52% ) and a complete complex bearing accessory factors on both flanks of the mTOR dimer ( 18% ) ( Figure 1—figure supplement 4 ) . Since only a fraction of particles were of the complete complex we conclude that our mTORC2 sample dissociated prior to fixation or due to non-exhaustive cross-linking . Subsequent refinement of the complete complex with the application of C2 symmetry resolved the entire complex to 7 . 4 Å , while a focused refinement on the accessory factor density yielded 6 . 2 Å resolution , based upon a gold standard FSC of 0 . 143 ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3 ) . The resolution is likely limited by the achieved contrast in the measured micrographs and the inherent flexibility of the Rictor/SIN1 domains . The complete human mTORC2 dimer displays a general organization similar to that we previously reported for mTORC1 ( Aylett et al . , 2016 ) ( Figure 1 ) . The previous 26 Å structure of Saccharomyces cerevisiae TORC2 was refined without symmetry because of substantial differences in the densities resolved on either side of the central cavity ( Gaubitz et al . , 2015 ) ( Figure 1—figure supplement 5 ) , however , our complete mTORC2 complex is effectively identical ( real-space two-fold rotated correlation >0 . 9 ) on either side of the symmetry axis to at least 8 . 9 Å ( the limit of resolution in C1 ) refined without symmetry ( Figure 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 3 ) . Both mTORC1 and mTORC2 therefore function as dimeric , C2 symmetric , complexes . The dimeric arrangement of mTOR in mTORC2 is most similar to that observed for the K . m . TOR-Lst8 ( Baretić et al . , 2016 ) ( Figure 1—figure supplement 5 ) . The FAT domains of the ( m ) TOR dimer in mTORC2 and TOR-Lst8 come within 6 Å of each other , contrary to the conformation of the mTOR dimer in mTORC1 that is substantially outward-rotated . The resemblance between the free mTOR dimer and the mTOR dimer found within the mTORC2 complex may account for the increased lability of mTORC2 compared to mTORC1 . Rictor makes up most ( ~60% ) of the mass of the mTOR accessory proteins and is predicted to have an almost entirely helical secondary structure , most of which is expected to be α-solenoidal . SIN1 consists of two domains of known structure , a CRIM domain and a PH domain , neither of which form α-solenoids . While it remains impossible to definitively trace a polypeptide chain at this resolution , we were able to identify five regions of stacked α-solenoidal repeats , of which three can be resolved to the level of individual helices and two are less well ordered , that make up the majority of the density outside of the mTOR-mLST8 dimer and account for most of the elements expected to correspond to Rictor ( Figure 2A ) . The assignment of the major density features to Rictor is confirmed by a negatively stained EM reconstruction of mTORC2 lacking Protor-1 , which recapitulates density for all but one partially disordered extremus of the accessory protein region ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) . The most striking feature , which we dub the ‘tower’ , is a well-resolved , 9/10-α-hairpin stack rising from the ‘bridge’ HEAT repeat of mTOR . This centrepiece is joined at one-third its length from the bridge by another well-resolved α-solenoid , encompassing 4/5-hairpins , which we refer to as the ‘buttress’ . The buttress links the tower to a region we term the ‘body’ , comprising three further repeats ( 9–11 hairpins in total ) that stack against one another , with its periphery being poorly ordered . The body is only peripherally associated with the mTOR dimer . Finally , at the top of the tower , a ‘cap’ region of linked density juts out toward the mTOR active site . No large regions of non-α-solenoidal density were resolved , preventing us from assigning a location to SIN1 , although a small region of non-helical density at the extremity of the cap represents the most likely candidate . This location of SIN1 would corroborate previous studies implying an interaction between SIN1 and mLST8 and a role of the SIN1 CRIM domain in recruiting substrates towards the active site of mTOR within mTORC2 ( Tatebe et al . , 2017 ) . The principal site of interaction between Rictor and the mTOR-mLST8 dimer is the juncture of the bridge and the horn , which is occupied by the base of the tower and its contact with the buttress . This is the same site occupied by the characteristic mTORC1 subunit Raptor ( Figure 2C ) . Baretic and colleagues have established that the TOR dimer interface runs along this plane , and have shown that a partner protein is not required for TOR dimer formation ( Baretić et al . , 2016 ) . We confirm this observation for mTOR-mLST8 , demonstrating that the Rictor-mTOR and Raptor-mTOR interactions can be formed only with intact mTOR dimer and are not required to stabilise the mTOR dimer . Given that the inter-subunit interfaces are completely different in the two mTOR complexes ( in Raptor the cleft between the horn and bridge is occupied by the loops at the tips of three helical hairpins , whereas in mTORC2 a single helix covers the length of the cleft ) , there must be an as yet unknown selective advantage to a dimeric architecture . Another less well-resolved contact is the junction of the body and the free end of the bridge amino-terminal HEAT repeats within the mTOR dimer , which does not recapitulate any contact found in mTORC1 . Regions of Raptor make contact with the HEAT repeat horn in the mTORC1 structure , however , the horn does not appear to make an analogous contact with any mTORC2 accessory protein . The differences between mTORC1 and mTORC2 in the mTOR-exposed surfaces of the horn region are presumably linked to their distinct modes of regulation by post-translational modifications or binding of associated protein factors . The final major contact identified between Rictor and the mTOR dimer is near the FRB domain of mTOR . The tower α-solenoid repeat bridges the gap between the binding site at the juncture of the mTOR dimer and the FRB domain of mTOR itself , while the cap , which is connected to the tower , straddles the surface of the FRB , deepening the active site cleft of the mTOR kinase domain . Raptor similarly deepens the active site in mTORC1 , but from a position directly opposite mLST8 , as opposed to Rictor , which approaches from the other side of the active site . This position of the cap masks the FKBP-rapamycin binding site of mTOR , thereby explaining the rapamycin insensitivity of mTORC2 ( Figure 2B ) . This finding is consistent with what was seen previously with yeast TORC2 ( Gaubitz et al . , 2015 ) . It is tempting to conclude that this region is responsible for substrate recruitment , given its proximity to the active site , however , further study is required to confirm this . The architecture of human mTORC2 reveals that the two mTOR complexes share many features , including the preservation of effective C2 symmetry , the common binding site for the principal accessory proteins Raptor and Rictor , the deepening of the active site cleft and the significant distance between the presumptive substrate-selection region and the active site of mTOR . While this manuscript was under revision , another publication described the architecture of yeast TORC2 at a resolution of 7 . 9 Å ( Karuppasamy et al . , 2017 ) . The main conclusions drawn in that publication are consistent with our findings . Many important biological questions remain , in particular the reason for the requirement for C2 symmetry , and the exact identity and function of the mTORC2 domains making up the cap region . A full interpretation of human mTORC2 must await future higher-resolution studies of a more stable form of the complex . 3 Materials and methods Unless otherwise stipulated , Sf21 insect cell lines and media were provided by Expression Systems ( Davies , USA ) and Lonza ( Basel , Switzerland ) , respectively . Cell lines have been tested negative for mycoplasma contamination using the MycoAlert mycoplasma detection kit from Lonza ( Basel , Switzerland ) . Chromatography equipment was provided by GE Healthcare ( Schenectady , USA ) , chemicals were provided by Sigma Aldrich ( St . Louis , USA ) and Applichem ( Darmstadt , Germany ) , electron microscopy consumables were provided by Agar Scientific ( Stansted , UK ) , and molecular graphics were generated using Chimera ( Pettersen et al . , 2004 ) , Coot ( Emsley et al . , 2010 ) and PyMol ( Schrödinger LLC , New York , USA ) . Expression plasmids were prepared by cloning an internal FLAG-tag into pAB2G-mTOR after Asp258 , the coding sequence of Rictor into pIDK , SIN1 into pAB1G and mLST8 into pIDC . A triple pIDC expression plasmid encoding mLST8 , SIN1 and Protor-1 was synthesized de novo ( Genscript , Piscataway , USA ) . Rictor was originally amplified from myc-Rictor corrected , which was a gift from David Sabatini ( Sarbassov et al . , 2004 ) ( Addgene plasmid #11367 ) . In order to clone tandem-tomato ( tdTomato ) labeled SIN1 , the tdTomato cDNA was amplified from tdTomato-N1 and inserted into pAB1G-SIN1 using the In-Fusion HD cloning kit ( Takara Bio USA , Mountain View , USA ) . tdTomato-N1 was kindly provided by M . Davidson and R . Tsien ( Addgene plasmid #54642 ) . The complex of H . s . mTORC2 was expressed in Sf21 cells using the ‘MultiBac’ Baculovirus expression system ( Fitzgerald et al . , 2006 ) ( Geneva Biotech , Geneva , Switzerland ) . Briefly , expression plasmids encoding FLAG-tagged mTOR , Rictor and the triple expression plasmid encoding SIN1 , mLST8 , and Protor-1 were fused to a ‘MultiBac’ expression plasmid using Cre-recombinase ( New England Biolabs , Ipswich , USA ) and recombined with a bacmid for baculovirus production . In order to express mTORC2-ΔProtor-1 the plasmids encoding Flag-tagged mTOR , Rictor and mLST8 were fused to a ‘MultiBac’ expression plasmid and recombined with a bacmid for baculovirus production . Baculovirus for the expression of tdTomato tagged SIN1 was produced separately . For the expression and purification of mTORC2-ΔProtor-1 , Sf21 cells were coinfected with baculovirus encoding Flag-mTOR , Rictor and mLST8 and baculovirus encoding SIN1-tdTomato . Sf21 cells expressing mTORC2 or mTORC2-ΔProtor-1 were harvested 72 hr post-infection and lysed in 50 mM bicine pH 8 . 5 , 200 mM NaCl , 2 mM MgCl2 lysis buffer by sonication . The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 234 788 · g and then incubated with anti- DYKDDDDK agarose beads ( Genscript , Piscataway , USA ) for 2 hr at 4°C . The beads were washed 4 times in 50 mM bicine pH 8 . 5 , 200 mM NaCl and bound protein was eluted with DYKDDDDK-peptide ( 0 . 6 mg/ml; Genscript , Piscataway , USA ) . The eluted protein was concentrated to 0 . 5 ml and applied to a tandem Superose 6 Increase 10/300 GL gel filtration column equilibrated in 10 mM bicine pH8 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 5 mM EDTA , 2 mM TCEP . Fractions corresponding to mTORC2 were pooled , concentrated and directly used for further experiments . mTORC2 kinase activity assays were conducted in 25 mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 , 100 mM potassium acetate , 2 mM MgCl2 using Akt-1 ( Jena Bioscience , Jena , Germany ) as a substrate . The indicated gel filtration fractions of a mTORC2 preparation were pooled and concentrated . In a 50 µl reaction volume 8 . 5 µg mTORC2 or mTOR/mLST8 were mixed with 100 ng inactive Akt-1 in reaction buffer and where indicated with 20 µM Torin1 . The mixture was pre-incubated for 5 min on ice , and the reaction was initiated with the addition of 50 µM ATP . After 20 min at 37°C the reaction was terminated by the addition of 12 . 5 µl 5x SDS loading buffer . The reactions were Western Blotted using primary antibodies against phospho-Akt-Ser473 ( #4060 ) , Akt ( #4685 ) , and mTOR ( #2972; Cell Signaling Technologies , Beverly , USA ) at a dilution of 1:1000 . A goat anti-rabbit HRP-labeled antibody ( ab6721; Abcam , Cambridge , UK ) was used as the secondary antibody at a dilution of 1:3000 . Given that H . s . mTORC2 proved highly labile , it was purified , fixed and quenched using a modification of the GraFix protocol ( Kastner et al . , 2008 ) . Briefly , 7 . 5–27 . 5% ( w/v ) gradients were prepared from 150 mM NaCl , 15 mM NaBicine pH 8 . 0 , 1 mM TCEP . The upper quarter of the less dense buffer was supplemented with 0 . 25% glutaraldehyde ( Grade I ) , whereas the lower quarter of the denser buffer was supplemented with 150 mM NH4Cl . Samples were subjected to ultracentrifugation for 16 hr at 100 000 ∙ g in an SW32 rotor , thereby both fixing and quenching the sample in situ , and recovered by gradient fractionation . The recovered peak was concentrated to as low a volume as possible in 100 kDa cutoff Vivaspin concentrators ( Sartorius Stedim Biotech , Aubagne , France ) . The buffer was then exchanged three times against 150 mM NaCl , 15 mM NaBicine pH 8 . 0 , 1 mM TCEP in order to minimise the residual sugar in the final sample . A fixed sample of mTORC2 was applied to a carbon coated holey carbon grid and stained with 2% ( w/v ) uranyl acetate . Micrographs ( 33 ) were collected using an FEI F20 electron microscope ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA , USA ) at a magnification of 82 000 fold , an acceleration voltage of 200 kV , and a total dose of 20 e/A2 at a defocus of between −0 . 5 and −2 . 0 μm . Particles ( 15 331 ) were selected semi-automatically using BOXER ( Ludtke et al . , 1999 ) . The parameters of the contrast transfer function were then determined with CTFFIND4 ( Rohou and Grigorieff , 2015 ) . Particles were 2D-classified into 100 classes in two dimensions using RELION ( Scheres , 2012 ) and sixteen well-defined classes were selected for initial three-dimensional reconstruction . Initial models were created using the e2initialmodel . py function in EMAN 2 . 1 ( Tang et al . , 2007 ) , then filtered to 60 Å and used as an initial reference for gold-standard refinement . The resulting initial model ( resolution 26 Å , gold-standard FSC ) was used for further refinement . We prepared EM samples from the peak fraction of the final Superose 6 Increase gel filtration step by negative staining . The sample was adsorbed to a freshly glow discharged thin carbon film supported on a 200 mesh copper grid and stained with 2% ( w/v ) uranyl acetate solution for 1 min with one additional post-staining step . The grid was imaged on a Philips CM 100 operated at 13700 fold nominal magnification at 80 kV acceleration voltage with an Olympus Veleta camera resulting in a pixel size of 5 . 4 Å on the specimen level . Images were acquired at a defocus between −0 . 9 and −1 . 7 μm . Particles ( 13879 ) were selected semi-automatically using BOXER ( Ludtke et al . , 1999 ) . Contrast transfer function parameters were determined with CTFFIND4 ( Rohou and Grigorieff , 2015 ) . All further processing steps were done within the RELION software ( Scheres , 2012 ) . Initially , particles were classified into 50 classes followed by a second round of classification into 80 classes ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ) . Well-defined average images were selected , and the subset of particles which contributed to these average images was chosen for further processing . An initial model was created without applying symmetry using the 3D initial model function of RELION , which utilizes a stochastic gradient descent algorithm for de novo structure determination . The initial model was refined and used in a 3D classification into three classes applying C2 symmetry . One class ( 1261 particles ) showed well-defined density for the core and the peripheral domains ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ) . This reconstruction ( 29 Å resolution ) was superimposed on the cryo-EM reconstruction using UCSF CHIMERA ( Pettersen et al . , 2004 ) . We prepared EM samples from affinity-purified mTORC2-ΔProtor-1 by crosslinking and negative staining . Briefly , a sample of the mTORC2-ΔProtor-1 complex was stabilised by fixation with 0 . 1% ( v/v ) glutaraldehyde for 15 min on ice . The sample was adsorbed to a thin carbon film and stained with 2% ( w/v ) uranyl acetate solution for 2 min with three additional post-staining steps . The sample was imaged on a Tecnai F20 electron microscope operated at 82 000 fold magnification at 200 kV acceleration voltage . Images were acquired under low dose conditions with a total dose of 20 e/Å2 at −1 to −2 μm defocus on a Gatan US 4 000 CCD camera . A total of 35 micrographs were selected for further processing in Relion2 ( Scheres , 2012 ) using contrast transfer function correction with CTFFIND4 ( Rohou and Grigorieff , 2015 ) . Single particle images were picked with Relion using a gaussian picking reference . After two-dimensional classification 13 170 single particle images were selected for refinement , during which C2 symmetry was applied . The structure of the mTORC2-ΔProtor-1 complex was refined to a final resolution of 21 Å ( gold-standard FSC , 0 . 143 criterion ) ( Scheres , 2012 ) . Samples of mTORC2 were applied to holey carbon copper grids ( R2/2 – Quantifoil ) bearing an additional fine film of carbon . Grids were blotted for two seconds and then plunged directly into a mixture of liquid ethane ( 33% ) and propane ( 67% ) using a vitrobot mark 4 ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA , USA ) at 4°C and 95% humidity . Data were recorded semi-automatically using SerialEM ( Mastronarde , 2005 ) on a Titan Krios transmission electron microscope ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA , USA ) equipped with a K2 Summit direct electron detector ( GATAN , San Diego , USA ) at 300 kV , 47 100 fold magnification and with an applied defocus of between −1 . 0 and −3 . 0 μm , resulting in 3 997 images of 3 838 by 3 710 pixels with a pixel size of 1 . 06 Å on the object scale . Each image was recorded as forty separate frames in electron counting mode , comprising a total exposure of 80 e-Å−2 , which were subsequently aligned , summed and weighted by dose according to the method of Grant and Grigorieff ( Grant and Grigorieff , 2015 ) using Motioncor2 ( Zheng et al . , 2017 ) to obtain the final image . Poor quality micrographs were rejected based on the diminished maximum resolution and regularity of the Thon rings observed in the power spectra . Estimation of the contrast transfer function was carried out for each image using CTFFIND4 ( Rohou and Grigorieff , 2015 ) , particles were selected using BATCHBOXER ( Ludtke et al . , 1999 ) , and refinement thereafter performed using RELION ( Scheres , 2012 ) . Two cycles of two-dimensional reference-free alignment of 207 920 boxed particles into 100 classes were performed initially , and particles that did not yield high-resolution class averages were excluded from further refinement . Three-dimensional classification of the remaining 94 953 mTORC2 particles into six classes was then performed with RELION ( Scheres , 2012 ) , separating the dataset into classes without excess density ( mTOR-mLST8 - 28 774 ) , occupied on one flank ( C1-mTORC2 - 48 996 ) , and doubly occupied ( C2-mTORC2 - 17 183 ) . The C2 particles were refined independently ( gold-standard ) using full-sized images , resulting in a complete symmetrical mTORC2 density map with an estimated resolution of 7 . 4 Å at a Fourier shell correlation of 0 . 143 ( Scheres , 2012 ) . Resolution was limited by the poor cryo-stability of the complex , the necessity for heavy fixation of the sample , and by conformational flexibility . Additionally , the mTOR-mLST8 core dominated the overall particle alignment , resulting in lower local resolution for the accessory proteins due to their flexibility . In order to attain the highest possible resolution of the accessory factors , the C1-mTORC2 particles and the two symmetrical sides of each C2-mTORC2 particle were refined in combination by subtracting the symmetry-related density and refining all occupied sides of the molecule in a single class , yielding a focused accessory factor density map with an estimated resolution of 6 . 2 Å at a Fourier shell correlation of 0 . 143 ( Scheres , 2012 ) . The cryo-EM density map representing the complete structure of mTORC2 with C2 symmetry has been deposited in the EM Databank under accession code EMDB ID EMD-3927 . The density corresponding to the focused refinement on the accessory proteins of mTORC2 has been deposited in the EM Databank under accession code EMDB ID EMD-3928 ."}

These results suggest that ‘rewiring’ of BRCA1-deficient cells to employ an Exo1-independent hyper-resection pathway is a driver of PARPi resistance .", "plain language summary": "Healthy cells can typically repair damage to their DNA with high accuracy , keeping their genetic code intact . In contrast , cancer cells often lose this ability . Inaccurate repair leads to more frequent DNA mutations , which can make a tumor more aggressive . However , DNA repair-deficient tumors can be targeted with cancer therapies , such as PARP inhibitors , which kill cells that do not have working DNA repair mechanisms . PARP inhibitors show great promise clinically , but unfortunately some tumor cells can become resistant to these treatments over time . Recent work has shown that resistance to PARP inhibitors is often caused by further alternations to DNA repair machineries . Being able to visualize DNA repair in living cells is crucial to understanding this process and to find ways to improve cancer treatments . Previous studies have used repetitive DNA sequences called Lac operators ( LacO ) to visualize the dynamic behavior of DNA in live cells . Leland et al . have now adapted this system to watch individual DNA repair events in living yeast cells under the microscope . Their experiments reveal that when cells lose a single protein called Rev7 , an early phase of DNA repair becomes hyperactive . Leland et al . traced the cause of this hyperactivity to an enzyme in the RecQ helicase family . A RecQ helicase becoming hyperactive in cells lacking Rev7 could explain how some cancer cells become resistant to PARP inhibitor treatments . This information could help fine-tune future approaches to treating cancer . For example , using an inhibitor of RecQ helicase alongside PARP inhibitors may help block this type of resistance from developing in the first place . As well as potentially paving the way for better cancer treatments , this method of visualization could improve scientists’ understanding of the basic processes of DNA repair .", "article": "1 Introduction DNA repair is an essential process conserved throughout evolution and commonly disrupted in tumor cells ( Jeggo et al . , 2016 ) . Many cancer treatments , including poly ( ADP ribose ) polymerase ( PARP ) inhibitors ( PARPi ) , target DNA repair pathways to kill rapidly dividing , repair-deficient cells ( Farmer et al . , 2005; Fojo and Bates , 2013; Lord et al . , 2015; Mateo et al . , 2015 ) . 5’ end resection , which generates tracts of single-strand DNA ( ssDNA ) at DNA double-strand break ( DSB ) ends dictates repair pathway choice: blocking resection promotes canonical non-homologous end joining ( typically in G1 ) , while initiating resection commits a DSB to repair by homologous recombination ( HR ) , usually in S/G2 ( Chapman et al . , 2012; Hustedt and Durocher , 2016; Symington , 2016 ) . The resection machinery is tightly controlled at both the step of resection initiation ( involving Ctp1/Sae2/CtIP and the MRN/X complex ) and during long-range resection , which is mediated by two parallel pathways catalyzed by either the exonuclease Exo1 or the combination of a RecQ helicase and Dna2 ( Chen et al . , 2012; Croteau et al . , 2014; Nimonkar et al . , 2011; Tkáč et al . , 2016; Zimmermann et al . , 2013 ) . Additional accessory factors play key roles as modulators of resection; for example , loss of Rev7/MAD2L2/FANCV , a small , multifunctional HORMA domain protein ( Bluteau et al . , 2016; Rosenberg and Corbett , 2015 ) derepresses resection inhibition ( Boersma et al . , 2015; Xu et al . , 2015 ) , thereby allowing HR-deficient , Brca1–/–p53–/– cells to become resistant to PARPi . In human cells , Rev7 appears to act in concert with another inhibitor of resection , 53BP1 ( Chapman et al . , 2013; Ochs et al . , 2016; Zimmermann et al . , 2013 ) , loss of which is also sufficient to drive PARPi resistance ( Boersma et al . , 2015; Bouwman et al . , 2010; Jaspers et al . , 2013; Xu et al . , 2015 ) . Importantly , the mechanisms by which Rev7 and 53BP1 inhibit DSB end resection remain poorly understood . To gain insights into how resection is controlled , we have developed a single-cell microscopy-based assay capable of quantitatively measuring DSB end resection rates in the facile genetic model , S . pombe . Leveraging this assay , we find that Rev7 and the 53BP1 orthologue , Crb2 , specifically inhibit the RecQ-helicase-dependent long-range resection pathway . Moreover , through derepression of RecQ helicases , rev7∆ or crb2∆ cells can achieve very fast resection rates ( >20 kb/hr ) – approximately twice as fast as Exo1-dependent long-range resection . As BRCA1 activity has been tied to Exo1-dependent long-range resection ( Tomimatsu et al . , 2012 ) , our findings suggest that PARPi resistance can be driven by compensation through derepression of the RecQ-helicase-dependent resection pathway . 2 Results In order to quantitatively measure initial steps in DSB processing in single , living cells , we developed a microscopy-based DSB end resection assay ( Figure 1A ) . In this system , an ectopic 10 . 3 kb , 256-copy LacO array and adjacent HO endonuclease cut site ( HOcs ) are engineered at a euchromatic ( but intergenic ) region near Mmf1 ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . A single , site-specific DSB is generated by regulating the expression of the HO endonuclease under the control of the Ura-inducible Purg1lox RMCE system ( Watson et al . , 2008; 2011 ) . The timing of on-target DSB events is visualized by the appearance of a Rad52 ( Rad22 ) -mCherry focus that co-localizes with Mmf1:LacO/LacI-GFP ( Figure 1B ) . By tracking cell lineages , we see that HO endonuclease induction produces on-target Rad52-mCherry foci in S/G2 ( G1 is very short in S . pombe ) when the repair machinery is primed for HR ( Symington and Gautier , 2011 ) ( Figure 1B ) . Importantly , we do not observe loading of Rad52-mCherry at the LacO/LacI-GFP array in the absence of HO endonuclease expression ( on-target Rad52 foci in <0 . 2% of uninduced cells , n = 657 ) , suggesting that the LacO array is not sufficient to create a ‘fragile site’ in S . pombe ( Jacome and Fernandez-Capetillo , 2011; Saad et al . , 2014 ) . As resection proceeds , the LacO repeats become single-stranded , disrupting LacI-GFP binding and causing the intensity of the GFP focus to progressively decrease ( Bell and Lewis , 2001 ) ( Figure 1B , Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ) . To verify that loss of GFP focus intensity reflects DSB end resection , we analyzed cells lacking Exo1 , which catalyzes the majority of long-range resection in WT S . pombe , with the Rqh1/Sgs1/BLM and Dna2 resection pathway playing a secondary role ( Langerak et al . , 2011 ) . As expected , cells lacking Exo1 show a persistent LacO/LacI-GFP focus over many hours even after Rad52-mCherry loads ( Figure 1C ) . Importantly , loss of Exo1 does not influence the induction of the site-specific DSB as measured by quantitative loss of a PCR product across the cut site ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3A ) . This assay only visualizes DSB foci after resection initiation by Ctp1/Sae2/CtIP and MRN/MRX ( ~100 nt of resection ) , as Rad52 loads at DSBs by exchanging with RPA on nascent , resected ssDNA ends ( Jensen and Russell , 2016; Lisby et al . , 2004; Ma et al . , 2015; Mimitou and Symington , 2008 ) . Using quantitative imaging with calibration strains , we estimate that visualization of the Rad52-mCherry focus requires loading of ~30 copies ( see Materials and methods ) , representing a Rad52 filament equivalent to at least 90 nt ( but likely several hundred nts , see below ) of resected ssDNA on each sister in G2 ( Gibb et al . , 2014; Grimme et al . , 2010; Kagawa et al . , 2002; Singleton et al . , 2002; Swartz et al . , 2014; Wu and Pollard , 2005 ) . To test the frequency with which resection initiation leads to visible Rad52 foci in this assay , we compared the timing of Rad52-mCherry foci formation within the cell population to an independent measure of resection using a quantitative PCR ( qPCR ) assay in which resection protects from digestion at an ApoI cut site 168 nt downstream of the HO cut site ( Langerak et al . , 2011 ) ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3B ) . Using this qPCR-based assay , we observe similar DSB induction frequency and kinetics for ApoI protection and Rad52 focus formation , with an apparent 30–60 min delay between ApoI protection ( qPCR ) and Rad52-mCherry loading , which likely represents the time required for RPA loading and exchange to Rad52 ( Lisby et al . , 2004 ) ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3C ) . As the visibility of the LacO array is an important endpoint for this assay , we estimate that the LacI-GFP focus is visible down to a LacO array length of <500 bps under these conditions , based on our ability to robustly detect the focus from a 1 kb LacO array integrated into S . pombe ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3D–G ) . By measuring the time interval between Rad52-mCherry focus formation and LacO/LacI-GFP focus disappearance , we can determine the time required to resect through the full LacO array in individual cells ( Figure 1B , Figure 1—figure supplement 2A-D , blue boxes ) . For example , for the two daughter cells in Figure 1B arising from cell division , the time interval from Rad52-mCherry loading until loss of the LacO/LacI-GFP focus is 150 min for the upper cell ( ‘1’ ) , and 140 min for the lower cell ( ‘2’ ) . The progressive loss of LacI-GFP intensity and gain in Rad52-mCherry intensity during the duration of resection is further illustrated by quantitative image analysis ( Figure 1E–F and Figure 1—figure supplement 3A'–B' ) . As we know the genomic separation of the LacO array and the HO cut site ( 13 . 9 kb , Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) , we can calculate the resection rate from the resection duration . For example , the calculated resection rates for the two cells in Figure 1B are very similar at 5 . 55 and 5 . 94 kb/hr . Across all WT cells , we detect a median , long-range resection rate of 7 . 6 kb/hr ( Figure 1F ) . This rate is somewhat faster than the resection rates measured by previous population-based assays using qPCR in S . pombe ( 4 kb/hr ) or Southern blot in S . cerevisiae ( 4 . 4 kb/hr ) ( Langerak et al . , 2011; Zhu et al . , 2008 ) . As this assay isolates the process of long-range resection after Rad52 loading , one possibility is that resection rates that measure both resection initiation and long-range resection give rise to slower rates . Importantly , using the qPCR approach to compare resection upstream of the DSB ( which contains the LacO array ) and downstream of the DSB ( which does not ) demonstrates that any influence of the LacO array on resection rate is minor ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3H ) . As resection in the absence of Exo1 is very inefficient ( Figure 1C ) , the rate cannot be determined using this assay . However , we can infer an upper bound of the long-range resection rate of ~2 . 8 kb/hr for exo1∆ cells . We also note a strong inhibition of resection ( comparable to ctp1∆ cells ) as close as 300 nts from the DSB in cells lacking Exo1 as detected by qPCR ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3I ) ; this correlates with a defect in Rad52-mCherry loading in the imaging-based resection assay ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3J ) . This observation confirms that the extent of resection required to form visible Rad52 foci in this assay discussed above ( ~30 molecules; <300 nt ) partially requires Exo1-dependent resection in addition to MRN/MRX- and Ctp1/Sae2/CtIP-dependent resection initiation ( Symington , 2016 ) , consistent with a study in budding yeast suggesting a specific requirement for Exo1 in the early phase of resection post-initiation ( Saad et al . , 2014 ) . 53BP1 ( in human cells ) and its orthologue Rad9 ( in budding yeast ) repress resection initiation ( Chapman et al . , 2012; Ferrari et al . , 2015; Symington , 2016 ) ; in budding yeast , loss of Rad9 also increases resection efficiency ( Bonetti et al . , 2015 ) . Applying the live cell resection assay to fission yeast lacking the orthologous Crb2 , we observe a strong increases the median rate of resection to ( 13 . 9 kb/hr ) , with some individual cells demonstrating very fast ( ~40 kb/hr ) resection rates ( Figure 1F ) . Thus , we can readily assess factors that positively and negatively influence long-range resection rate using this new LacO-based assay . Next , we examined how loss of Rev7 influences long-range resection at DSBs during S/G2 . The duration of LacO array resection is shorter in rev7∆ cells than in WT cells ( 80 min or less , Figure 2A–B and Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) . In the population , the median long-range resection rate for rev7∆ cells is similar to cells lacking Crb2 ( 10 . 4 kb/hr , Figure 2C ) . As Rev7 also functions with Rev3 as part of the polymerase ζ complex in translesion synthesis , we also confirmed that Rev3 does not affect resection ( Figure 2C ) , consistent with previous data showing that repressing resection during HR is a distinct function of Rev7 ( Boersma et al . , 2015; Rosenberg and Corbett , 2015; Xu et al . , 2015 ) . Using the orthogonal qPCR approach ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3B ) , we confirm that in rev7∆ cells , more chromosomes with DSBs have undergone 3 kb and 13 kb of resection than WT between 90 and 180 min after HO induction , respectively ( Figure 2D ) . Again , loss of Rev7 has no influence on the rate of DSB induction ( Figure 2E ) . We next asked if Crb2/Rad9/53BP1 and Rev7 inhibit long-range resection through the Exo1 pathway , the RecQ helicase ( Rqh1 ) -Dna2 pathway , or both ( Symington and Gautier , 2011 ) . Interestingly , we find that the rapid long-range resection rate observed in crb2∆ or rev7∆ cells is entirely Exo1-independent ( Figure 3A–C , Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) . In stark contrast , the rapid rate of resection in a rev7∆ single mutant is entirely dependent on the presence of Rqh1 ( Figure 3A ) . Consistent with these observations , we find that loss of Rev7 is able to rescue the severe growth defect of exo1∆ cells on rich media plates containing camptothecin , consistent with a derepression of Rqh1-dependent resection in the absence of a functional Exo1 pathway ( Figure 3D ) . When considering only precisely determined resection events , the average long-range resection rate in crb2∆ cells is not statically less than that of crb2∆rqh1∆ cells when correcting for multiple comparisons ( p=0 . 16 ) ( Figure 3A ) . However , in many crb2∆rqh1∆ cells , resection durations extend beyond the timeframe of data acquisition , suggesting that rapid crb2∆ resection also requires Rqh1 ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2 ) . Taken together , these results strongly suggest that loss of either Rev7 or Crb2 drives a shift in resection pathway mechanism from Exo1 to the RecQ helicase-dependent pathway . Unlike Exo1-driven resection that dominates in WT cells , crb2∆ or rev7∆ cells in which the RecQ helicase is derepressed are capable of resection rates in excess of 20 kb/hr , indicating that the RecQ helicases are more capable of driving hyper-resection of DSBs than the Exo1-dependent pathway . The strong inhibition of RecQ helicase-dependent resection by Crb2 and Rev7 also explains why Rqh1 is not a major player in WT S . pombe resection , since Rqh1 can be derepressed to such a large extent ( by loss of Crb2 or Rev7 ) that Exo1 becomes dispensable for long-range resection in crb2∆exo1∆ and rev7∆exo1∆ cells ( Figure 3A-C , Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) . 3 Discussion Here , we demonstrate a microscopy-based assay capable of quantitatively measuring DSB end resection in living cells , specifically the long-range phase of resection catalyzed by Exo1 or Rqh1/Dna2 . By allowing for the visualization of resection in single cells , this assay reveals individual long-range resection rates , which will provide access to information about the variability in resection efficiency within cell populations . Moreover , as this assay allows the tracking of the location of DSB lesions within the nucleus , it will be able to uniquely interrogate the role of intranuclear architecture on resection rates and pathways in the future . By leveraging the advantages of this LacO-based assay , we show that Crb2/Rad9/53BP1 and Rev7 both act as specific inhibitors of RecQ helicase-mediated long-range resection of DSBs ( Figures 2 and 3 ) , supporting a model in which loss of these resection inhibitors drives a change in resection pathway rather than boosting Exo1-dependent resection . This is consistent with a previous study that identified specific mutations in the budding yeast RecQ helicase , Sgs1 , that can disrupt inhibition by the Crb2 orthologue , Rad9 , leading to a gain in Sgs1-dependent resection ( Bonetti et al . , 2015 ) , as well as a recent study highlighting the ability of Rad9 to antagonize resection at stalled replication forks by repressing a Dna2-dependent pathway ( Villa et al . , 2018 ) . Integrating these findings together with this study , we suggest that Crb2/Rad9 and Rev7 enforce Exo1-dependent long-range resection in yeasts , which prevents the hyper-resection that we find is characteristic of the RecQ helicase/Dna2 pathway ( Figure 3 and Bonetti et al . , 2015 ) . In support of this model , we find that loss of Rev7 is able to restore cell viability of exo1Δ cells on media containing camptothecin , suggesting that derepression of Rqh1 can substitute for loss of Exo1 , consistent with the gain in resection rate in cells lacking both Rev7 and Exo1 ( Figure 3 ) . The ability of Rev7 to antagonize RecQ helicase/Dna2-dependent long-range resection in fission yeast is very likely to be conserved in mammalian cells . Indeed , indirect evidence suggests that Rev7 knock-down promotes a gain in resection , as loss of Rev7 rescues CtIP-dependent RPA and Rad51 loading at irradiation-induced DSBs in cells lacking BRCA1 ( Xu et al . , 2015 ) . Importantly , the resection pathway responsible for the gain in repair factor loading was not investigated in this study , but our work suggests that BLM ( acting with DNA2 ) is a likely candidate . Loss of Rev7 does lead to longer 3’ single-stranded G-rich overhangs at telomeres in cells with inactivated TRF2 ( a component of the shelterin complex ) ; in this case , only a partial rescue was obtained by co-depletion of CtIP or Exo1 ( Boersma et al . , 2015 ) . Again , we hypothesize that this finding likely reflects contributions of BLM and DNA2 , although it remains possible that the impact of Rev7 on long-range resection during G2 figures more prominently in fission yeast . Critically , our findings suggest a new mechanism by which loss of either 53BP1 or Rev7 allows BRCA1-/- p53-/- cells to become resistant to PARP inhibitors ( Jaspers et al . , 2013; Xu et al . , 2015 ) . It has been proposed previously that the compromised CtIP- and Exo1-dependent resection in BRCA1-deficient cells can be restored by loss of 53BP1 or Rev7 ( Boersma et al . , 2015; Xu et al . , 2015 ) , thereby overcoming the increased DSB load caused by PARP inhibitors ( Polato et al . , 2014; Tomimatsu et al . , 2012 ) . Our study reveals that not just the efficiency , but also the molecular mechanism of resection is altered upon loss of Crb2/53BP1 or Rev7 . We expect these insights to have several consequences . First , RecQ helicases , when paired with DNA2 , are capable of exceptionally fast resection in vitro ( Niu et al . , 2010 ) , which when derepressed by loss of 53BP1 or Rev7 could cause extended tracts of ssDNA several kb long , promoting further genome instability ( Hicks et al . , 2010; Ochs et al . , 2016 ) ; indeed , our data point to such a hyper-resection phenotype upon loss of either Crb2 or Rev7 ( Figure 2C ) . Second , our results suggest that inhibitors of RecQ helicases could potentially re-sensitize BRCA1-null cells to PARP inhibitors , as this would make them both Exo1- and RecQ helicase-deficient ( Aggarwal et al . , 2013; Yazinski et al . , 2017 ) . 4 Materials and methods The strains used in this study are listed in Supplementary file 1 . S . pombe were grown , maintained , and crossed using standard procedures and media ( Moreno et al . , 1991 ) . Gene replacements were made by exchanging open reading frames with various MX6-based drug resistance genes ( Bähler et al . , 1998; Hentges et al . , 2005 ) . The 10 . 3 kb LacO array was inserted between Mmf1 and Apl1 on the right arm of chromosome II ( Chr II: 3 , 442 , 981 ) using a modified two-step integration procedure that first creates a site-specific DSB to increase targeting efficiency of linearized plasmid pSR10_ura4_10 . 3kb ( Leland and King , 2014; Rohner et al . , 2008 ) . A modified MX6-based hygromycin-resistance cassette containing the HO cut site was then inserted between Apl1 and Mug178 on chromosome II ( Chr II: 3 , 446 , 249 ) , 3 . 2 kb distal to the LacO insertion . The total distance between the HO cut site and the beginning of the 10 . 3 kb LacO array is 3 . 57 kb . As the LacO array can contract during the process of transformation , integrants were screened by HincII digest followed by southern blot ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) using standard procedures , a biotin-conjugated LacO probe , and a streptavidin-HRP chemilluminescent detection system ( Thermo #N100 and #34096 ) . We used the uracil-responsive Purg1lox expression system , with slight modifications , to induce HO endonuclease expression and create site-specific DSBs at the HO cut site ( Watson et al . , 2011; Watt et al . , 2008 ) . We performed a fresh integration of the HO gene at the endogenous urg1 locus for each experiment in order to reduce long-term instability at the HO cut site or the development of HO resistance , presumably due to insertion/deletion events caused by basal expression levels of HO . The pAW8ENdeI-HO plasmid ( a gift from Tony Carr ) was transformed into S . pombe , which were then plated onto EMM-leu+thi-ura plates ( -leucine: plasmid selection; +thiamine: Pnmt1-Cre repression; -uracil: Purg1lox-HO repression ) . After 4–5 days of growth at 30°C , 40–100 individual colonies were combined to obtain a reproducible plasmid copy number across the population . Cre-mediate HO gene exchange at the endogenous Urg1 locus ( urg1::RMCEbleMX6 ) was induced by overnight culture in EMM-thi-ura+ade+NPG media ( -thiamine: expression of Cre from pAW8ENdeI-HO; -uracil: Purg1lox-HO repression; +0 . 25 mg/mL adenine: reduce autofluorescence; +0 . 1 mM n-Propyl Gallate ( NPG ) : reduce photobleaching in microscopy experiments , prepared fresh ) . The following day , site-specific DSBs were induced in log-phase cultures by the addition of 0 . 50 mg/mL uracil . This induction strategy resulted in ~15% of cells making a DSB within ~2 hr ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3C ) . Initiation of resection was assessed using a previously described qPCR assay where ssDNA produced by resection causes protection from ApoI digestion ( Langerak et al . , 2011 ) . ApoI cut site positions ( relative to the HO cut cite ( Chr II: 3446192 ) ) and PCR primer sets spanning each ApoI recognition site can be found in Supplementary file 3 . Mock HincII digestions ( do not affect qPCR products ) and additional control primers at Ncb2 were used to normalize for ApoI digestion efficiency ( see Supplementary File 3 ) . All images were acquired on a DeltaVision widefield microscope ( Applied Precision/GE ) using a 1 . 2 NA 100x objective ( Olympus ) , solid-state illumination , and an Evolve 512 EMCCD camera ( Photometrics ) . Slides were prepared ~20 min after adding 0 . 50 mg/ml uracil to log-phase cultures to induce HO endonuclease expression and DSB formation . Cells were mounted on 1 . 2% agar pads ( EMM +0 . 50 mg/mL uracil , +2 . 5 mg/ml adenine , +0 . 1 mM freshly prepared NPG ) and sealed with VALAP ( 1:1:1 vaseline:lanolin:paraffin ) . Image acquisition began between 40 and 80 min after uracil addition . Imaging parameters for all resection assay data acquisition were as follows . Transmitted light: 35% transmittance , 0 . 015 s exposure; mCherry: 32% power , 0 . 08 s exposure; GFP: 10% power , 0 . 05 s exposure . At each time point ( every 10 min for 5–7 hr ) , 25 Z-sections were acquired at 0 . 26 μm spacing . Identical imaging parameters were used to image a strain expressing endogenously tagged Sad1-mCherry ( Sad1 forms a single focus at the spindle pole body that contains between 450 and 1030 molecules ) and relative mCherry foci intensities were used to determine that ~30 molecules of Rad52-mCherry are required to detect a visible focus with these imaging parameters ( Wu and Pollard , 2005 ) . For the LacO resection assay , every cell cycle was tracked and quantified individually , including timing of nuclear division , cellular division , Rad52-mCherry focus formation , and LacO/LacI-GFP focus disappearance . Only on-target Rad52 foci ( that co-localized with LacO/LacI-GFP for at least 2 frames ) were considered , since many DSB events occur throughout the genome spontaneously , especially during S-phase . The number of cells and events used to generate the plots in all Figures is included as Supplementary file 2 . The time between the first frame with an on-target Rad52-mCherry focus and the first frame with complete disappearance of the LacO/LacI-GFP focus is the duration of resection through 3 . 57 kb ( between the HO cut site and the start of the LacO repeats ) plus the full 10 . 3 kb LacO array . All fields from all genotypes were input into custom ImageJ macros that randomized the order of the fields/genotypes , blinded the images by removal of the file names , set the contrast to be identical for every image , and numbered each cell lineage . Each blinded field was then manually assessed for photobleaching of the LacO/LacI-GFP foci in cells without induced DSBs ( >80% of all cells ) to ensure that disappearance of any LacO/LacI-GFP foci in cells with on-target DSBs was due to resection through the LacO array rather than photobleaching of the GFP signal . Next , using the pre-determined contrast settings for mCherry and GFP channels ( to maintain consistency across all images analyzed ) individual cells which had on-target DSB events were manually identified , and scored for the first frame of Rad52-mCherry focus appearance and then the first frame in which the LacO/LacI-GFP focus had completely disappeared . For focus intensity plots ( e . g . Figure 1D , E ) , quantification was performed in ImageJ on the full 5D image stacks ( not maximum intensity projections , which are shown in the image panels throughout for ease of viewing , for example Figure 1B ) . Subpixel measurements were made in a cylinder approximating the point spread function surrounding the manually scored subpixel center of the focus . A cylindrical shell surrounding the focus was used for background subtraction in both the GFP and mCherry channels . Raw data were processed , visualized , and analyzed using R , in particular packages dplyr , ggplot2 , and broom . Raw data , raw analysis for all individual cells included in plots , complete code , and other supporting materials are publically available on GitHub https://github . com/lelandbr/Leland_King_2018_eLife_Rev7_EndResection ( King and Leland , 2018; copy archived at https://github . com/elifesciences-publications/Leland_King_2018_eLife_Rev7_EndResection ) . Cells were grown overnight in YE5S media . Concentrations for each culture were monitored by both OD600 and a Coulter Principle cell counter ( Orflow Moxi Z ) . Cultures were diluted as needed to ensure identical numbers of cells were spotted for each genotype , starting with ~4×106 cell/mL and going down by sixfold dilutions . Plates were prepared using standard procedures ( Moreno et al . , 1991 ) , with the addition of 30 μM camptothecin ( Sigma; ≥95% HPLC purified ) after autoclaving ."}

Yet , measles remains a major killer of children younger than age five worldwide , particularly among children living in Africa and Asia , where fewer children are immunized . India has been particularly hard hit , with annual child measles deaths exceeding 60 , 000 in 2005 . In the 1990s , India’s national vaccination program made one dose of the measles vaccine part of routine vaccinations through much of the country to help reduce the numbers of measles deaths . However , it was one of the last countries to add a second dose of measles vaccine as recommended by the World Health Organization , which has been shown to prevent infection and death in 90-95% of vaccinated children . In 2008 , the Indian government announced it would introduce a second dose of measles vaccine to its routine vaccine schedule for children from 2010 onwards . Prior to the introduction of a second-dose measles vaccine , campaigns were launched to increase immunization rates in regions where few children were being vaccinated . But how many young children’s lives were saved by these campaigns was unknown . Now , Wong et al . show that India’s measles immunization campaigns saved the lives of 41 , 000 to 56 , 000 children between 2010 and 2013 . This averted between 39-57% of the expected measles deaths nationally during that time period . Wong et al . used data from the Million Death Study , which used household surveys to capture information on the cause of 27 , 000 child deaths in India between 2005 and 2013 , to assess the affects of the state vaccination campaigns on measles deaths . Changes in measles deaths were compared to changes in unrelated child deaths to make sure any differences were related to the vaccination campaigns and not other improvements in children’s health care . Indian states with measles immunization campaigns saw larger decreases in measles deaths among children younger than five than states without such a campaign ( 27% vs 11% ) . Similar decreases were not seen in child deaths from other causes . Girls , who are disproportionately affected by measles in India , benefited from larger reductions in deaths than boys in states with immunization campaigns . The success of two-dose measles vaccination campaigns at reducing young children’s deaths in India may help to boost vaccination rates and help combat parents’ hesitance to immunize their children .", "article": "1 Introduction Measles remains an important cause of death among under-five children ( Moss , 2017 ) . Much of this persisting global burden of measles is located in Africa and Asia , notably in India ( Black et al . , 2010; Dabbagh et al . , 2017 ) . Direct estimation of cause-specific mortality documented a 90% decline in 1–59 month measles mortality rates in India from 2000 to 2015 ( Fadel et al . , 2017 ) . The role of national intervention strategies in explaining the decline in measles deaths in India is unknown . In 2005 , the Government of India launched the National Rural Health Mission – a program geared towards improving public health infrastructure and reducing child mortality in priority states ( Ministry of Health and Family Welfare , 2005 ) . In 2008 , the Government of India announced a policy change to introduce second-dose measles vaccine through the routine immunization ( Ministry of Health and Family Welfare , 2010 ) . District-level mass immunization campaigns ( termed supplementary immunization activities ) for second-dose measles vaccine were launched in 2010 in 14 target states where first-dose measles vaccination coverage was below 80% ( hereafter referred to as campaign states ) . The campaign prioritized immunization of children aged 9 months to 10 years in the 14 campaign states , after which second-dose measles vaccine was provided through routine immunization . The remaining 21 states with higher coverage added only second-dose measles vaccine through routine immunization ( Gupta et al . , 2011 ) . The ideal method of evaluation , a randomized trial , was not practical in the rollout of the national campaign . Mathematical models estimate an 84% decline in measles deaths globally during 2000–2016 , but are unable to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions ( Dabbagh et al . , 2017; Jha , 2014 ) . In these scenarios , interrupted time series is considered a robust quasi-experimental evaluation method ( Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care , 2017 ) . Here , we apply interrupted time series supplemented with multilevel regression analysis to provide the first direct quantification of the impact of the national mass measles immunization campaign on childhood measles mortality in India . These analyses have the additional advantage of using the Million Death Study ( MDS ) , a nationally representative sample of all deaths in India , including 27 , 000 child deaths from 1 . 3 million households surveyed from 2005 to 2013 ( Fadel et al . , 2017; Gomes et al . , 2017 ) . 2 Results From 2005 to 2013 , the MDS captured deaths for 13 , 490 girls and 13 , 007 boys aged 1–59 months after excluding children missing cause of death ( 2 . 8% ) . Of the 1 , 638 measles deaths using the definition of one or more physician coding or the family reported a measles history for the deceased , 79% occurred in rural areas , 73% in campaign states , 59% at ages 12–59 months , and 57% in girls ( Table 1 ) . 76% of families reporting a measles death noted the child to have a history of measles ( using the local language term ) , but only 39% of the deceased children received at least one dose of measles vaccine . The proportion of measles deaths at 1–59 months in campaign states reporting at least one dose of measles vaccine rose modestly ( 34% to 47% ) from 2005–2009 to 2010–2013 , but was mostly unchanged in non-campaign states ( 48% to 51% ) . Despite inherent misclassification that can be expected from verbal autopsies , we observed that the proportion vaccinated against measles did not differ across case definitions , suggesting that physician assignment of deaths was not unduly biased by a history of measles vaccination ( Table 1—source data 1 ) . Annual measles deaths at ages 1–59 months fell from 62 , 000 to 24 , 000 from 2005 to 2013 ( Figure 1 ) . Prior to campaign launch , 76% of measles deaths were concentrated in campaign states , 55% of which were in the states of Uttar Pradesh ( 18% ) , Madhya Pradesh ( 15% ) , Rajasthan ( 11% ) , and Bihar ( 11% ) . Following campaign launch , 59% of measles deaths were in campaign states , with 38% in the above four states ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . The age distributions did not differ greatly between pre-campaign and post-campaign periods ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ) . The 1–59 month measles mortality rate per thousand live births declined substantially during this period . The average annual rate reduction ( AARR ) in measles mortality over the full study period was 12% but accelerated to 22% following campaign launch . Post-campaign declines in measles mortality were faster in the campaign states ( 27% ) versus non-campaign states ( 11% ) . The AARR declined most notably in campaign states ( 15% ) and in the states of Madhya Pradesh ( 20% ) , Uttar Pradesh ( 19% ) , Rajasthan ( 17% ) , Chhattisgarh ( 17% ) , and Gujarat ( 14% ) ( Table 2 ) . Measles mortality rates among 1–59 month-old children in campaign states declined significantly following campaign launch ( Figure 2 ) when compared to control deaths from injuries , congenital anomalies , and non-communicable diseases of the same ages . There were no other mass public health interventions targeting this age group during the study period . The choice of control deaths is unbiased as these conditions are unaffected by measles vaccination and provide pre-intervention trends comparable to trends of measles deaths from 2005 to 2009 . As well , cases and controls deaths were sampled with the same method and assigned a cause of death by two independent physicians . We noted a temporary increase in measles mortality in 2009 . This might reflect increased reporting as this was also the period when measles surveillance expanded . Thus , we used 2009 as the intervention year to account for the increased reporting . The interrupted time series analyzes changes in the slope of six-month measles mortality rate per thousand live births and changes in the level ( which were few ) . Prior to campaign launch , the slope of measles mortality in campaign states remained unchanged at –0 . 004 deaths per thousand live births ( 95% CI –0 . 065 , 0 . 056; Table 3 ) . The control deaths also remained unchanged with an analogous slope of 0 . 003 ( 95% CI –0 . 054 , 0 . 062 ) . Following campaign launch , the slope of measles mortality in campaign states fell significantly to –0 . 164 ( 95% CI –0 . 320 , –0 . 008 , p=0 . 040 ) , whereas the slope for the control deaths remained unchanged . Declines in measles mortality in India overall were similar to declines in campaign states ( –0 . 132 , 95% CI –0 . 252 , –0 . 011 , p=0 . 034; Figure 3 ) . In comparison , non-campaign states saw no significant change in measles mortality rates following campaign launch . Notably , the rate ratio of 1–59 month measles mortality between campaign states and non-campaign states fell from 3 . 1 to 1 . 8 during 2005–2013 . The declines were specific to measles deaths , as we observed no significant changes in slope for pneumonia and diarrhoea deaths following campaign launch . Following campaign launch , we observed sharper declines in measles mortality rates among campaign states compared to non-campaign states ( Figure 3 ) . Girls residing in campaign states saw steeper declines in measles mortality relative to boys , even though the direction of effect was similar in both sexes . Additional stratified analyses yielded generally similar results . In campaign states , the decline in measles mortality was significant at 12–59 months but not significant at 1–11 months . At ages 1–59 months , alternative definitions of measles cases , using one or both physicians assigning measles as the underlying cause of death , also yielded similar results ( Figure 4 ) . We observed a significant change in slope and level in campaign states when two physicians agreed immediately or when one physician assigned measles as the cause of death ( both definitions excluded a family reported history of measles which might have been affected by publicity for the campaign ) . Moving the intervention year forward to 2010 resulted in the slope of measles mortality following campaign launch becoming non-significant ( –0 . 01 , 95% CI –0 . 08 , 0 . 05 ) . However , we observed a significant decrease in level of measles mortality following campaign launch ( –1 . 05 , 95% CI –1 . 50 , –0 . 61 ) . In all other stratified analyses , we observed no significant change in level ( Table 3 ) . National measles immunization coverage ( defined as the percentage of children aged 12 to 23 months receiving any dose of measles vaccine from routine immunization ) improved from 2002 to 2014 , particularly in campaign states ( Figure 5 ) . In difference-in-difference analysis , we observed a significant increase in measles vaccination coverage in the campaign states relative to non-campaign states , concurrent with campaign launch ( difference-in-difference estimate 16 . 9% , p=0 . 0000009 ) . Other coverage indicators , such as vitamin A supplementation , pneumonia treatment-seeking , oral rehydration , maternal literacy , and diarrhoea treatment-seeking showed significant increases over time , but these increases did not differ significantly between campaign and other states ( Figure 5 ) . Among 26 , 505 overall child deaths at 1–59 months for the whole of India from 2005 to 2013 , the odds of measles mortality were higher at 12–59 months ( OR 1 . 5 , 99% CI 1 . 3–1 . 7 ) than at ages 1–11 months , after adjusting for covariates identified in the above difference-in-difference analyses ( Figure 6 ) . Children born in 2009 or later were at lower odds of measles mortality compared with earlier births ( OR 0 . 8 , 99% CI 0 . 7–0 . 9 ) . Children living in districts within campaign states had lower odds of measles mortality ( OR 0 . 6 , 99% CI 0 . 4–0 . 8 ) than children living in non-campaign states . Girls had higher odds of measles mortality ( OR 1 . 3 , 99% CI 1 . 1–1 . 5 ) than boys . Consistent with this finding , girls had higher excess measles mortality risk relative to all-cause mortality in campaign states than boys , and the excess risk was distributed far more widely in girls than boys in these states ( Figure 7 ) . Conservatively , we estimate that the national campaign averted 41 , 000 to 56 , 000 ( median 48 , 500 ) child deaths in India during 2010–2013 ( Table 4 ) . The majority of deaths averted were in campaign states ( median 41 , 000 ) with a similar number of deaths averted among girls ( median 18 , 500 ) and boys ( median 22 , 500 ) in these states . For India as a whole , the averted measles deaths comprise 39–57% of the expected measles deaths during 2010–2013 . 3 Discussion The measles vaccine has high efficacy , preventing infection and death in 90–95% of children who receive two doses ( Guerra et al . , 2017; Moss , 2017 ) . However , evidence for vaccine effectiveness in low- and middle-income countries is more limited . Evidence of effectiveness at the population level is particularly required to counter scientific skepticism and waning public confidence in government immunization programs in India ( Francis et al . , 2018; Larson et al . , 2011; Larson et al . , 2010 ) . Our first ever quantification of the impact of national mass measles immunization campaign in a high-burden country using direct cause-specific data finds high effectiveness of measles vaccination programs in reducing child measles deaths in India . Our direct estimates of 41 , 000–56 , 000 measles deaths averted are consistent with modeled estimates documenting approximately 66 , 000 under-five child deaths averted ( Verguet et al . , 2017 ) . However , direct data are a far more robust form of evidence . We document 24 , 000 measles deaths in 2013 using a broad case definition that included family reporting of history of measles . WHO estimated 49 , 000 measles deaths in 2015 using a definition of either clinician-suspected measles infection or a diagnosis of fever with rash and cough , runny nose , or red eyes ( World Health Organization , 2018a; World Health Organization , 2016 ) . The addition of possible measles deaths with rash and fever to our original case definition raised the estimate of measles deaths in 2013 from 24 , 000 to 46 , 000 . At our observed rate of decline , we would expect 35 , 000 deaths in 2015 using the WHO definition . Further investigation of the reasons for these differences in total deaths from measles , particularly at the subnational level , is required . Fadel et al . ( 2017 ) documented 7 , 000 measles deaths in 2015 using a narrower case definition that excluded a history of measles and where all deaths were so assigned by dual physician coding with final adjudication by a third senior physician if needed . Thus , substantial downward revisions of WHO modeled estimates are likely needed . The relationship between measles cases and deaths in India is also uncertain , given that WHO incidence estimates are inconsistent with documented case fatality rates in India which range from 0 . 8–1 . 4% ( Sudfeld and Halsey , 2009; Verguet et al . , 2017; Wolfson et al . , 2009; World Health Organization , 2016; World Health Organization , 2018b; Murhekar et al . , 2014 ) . Our direct data should help to redefine current estimates of measles mortality and number of infections in India . Could measles transmission or , at a minimum , measles deaths be eliminated in India ? Drastic declines in child measles mortality suggest that elimination of measles deaths in India is feasible , albeit difficult . Measles elimination is challenging due to its high infectivity – each infected child can infect an additional 4–26 children in South-east Asia ( Guerra et al . , 2017; Holzmann et al . , 2016 ) . The WHO estimated the coverage of first-dose vaccine in South-east Asia ( which includes India ) to be below the levels that would achieve herd immunity ( 85% in 2012 ) and stagnation of coverage in the past decade ( Dabbagh et al . , 2017; Moss , 2017 ) . Documented measles outbreaks indicate that India remains endemic to measles given suboptimal coverage , with about 3 million infants not receiving first-dose measles vaccination in 2013 ( Dabbagh et al . , 2017; Jamir et al . , 2016; Singh and Garg , 2017; Vaidya et al . , 2016 ) . India’s Integrated Disease Surveillance Program reported a decline in annual measles outbreaks during 2011–2013 but gradual increases since ( Ministry of Health and Family Welfare , 2018 ) . The Global Vaccine Action Plan for 2012–2020 and the Government of India recommend second-dose measles vaccine to achieve herd immunity at 95% coverage to eliminate measles transmission ( Dabbagh et al . , 2017 ) . Supplementary immunization activities must be regularly scheduled to reach herd immunity and to combat resurgence ( Verguet et al . , 2017 ) . Though herd immunity may be difficult to achieve , efforts to improve vaccine coverage will curtail mortality , as evident by our findings . The observed reduction in under-five measles mortality may show herd immunity in cohorts born within nine months of the campaign launch . Since 2013 , 11 states in India have implemented laboratory-confirmed measles surveillance . This infrastructure provides sero-epidemiological data to facilitate diagnoses of measles , detect suspected cases , and sequence circulating measles genotypes ( Bose et al . , 2014; Vaidya , 2015; Vaidya and Chowdhury , 2017 ) . High quality measles surveillance through case-based detection and direct mortality statistics such as the MDS provide valuable data to monitor measles elimination programs ( Bose et al . , 2014; Vaidya , 2015 ) . The measles campaign was particularly successful for girls , which saw greater absolute declines in measles mortality than boys . Though the girl-boy gap in measles mortality rates narrowed , mortality remains higher in girls , as is the case for other infectious causes of death at ages 1–59 months ( Fadel et al . , 2017 ) . Persisting higher mortality rates among girls than boys may be due to lower vaccination coverage , social preference for boys , and lower levels of breastfeeding and health care access ( Alkema et al . , 2014; Corsi et al . , 2009; Fadel et al . , 2017; Guilmoto et al . , 2018; Jha et al . , 2006b; Ram et al . , 2013 ) . The interrupted time series design addresses potential confounding by the effects of different policies occurring at the same time as the measles campaign launch . Given that the majority of child causes of death were declining from 2000 onward , we selected unbiased control deaths comparable with the pre-intervention trends of measles , pneumonia , and diarrhoea deaths . The addition of control deaths allows for evaluation of post-intervention differences rather than single-group mean or slope differences . In stratified analysis , we tested alternate intervention time points and measles case definitions , all of which reported a consistent effect . We did not observe a change in slope when moving the intervention forward to 2010 , likely due to fewer time points in the post-intervention trend . The observed decreased in level of measles mortality when using 2010 as the intervention year might reflect greater actual vaccine delivery . The MDS verbal autopsy form is designed to identify all major causes of death in children with low levels of misclassification ( Aleksandrowicz et al . , 2014; Fadel et al . , 2017 ) . The verbal autopsy form contains specific questions relating to measles ( e . g . presence of rash , cough , whether the respondent reported history of measles ) but cannot ascertain exposure and timing of symptoms . Thus , we tested alternate case definitions , one including family-reporting of a history of measles to capture measles-associated deaths of pneumonia or diarrhoea , and the other using only physician coding of measles deaths . We observed declines specific to the campaign , in each case definition , as opposed to no additional declines in pneumonia or diarrhoea deaths . The lack of effect in pneumonia deaths may be due to measles contributing a smaller etiologic fraction than other viral , bacterial , or fungal agents ( Farrar et al . , submitted ) . The success of the measles campaign is the increase in vaccination in campaign states to levels comparable with non-campaign states . Though the effect was smaller in non-campaign states , the introduction of second-dose measles through routine immunization in these non-campaign states also contributed to the declines in measles mortality nationally . Continued diligence in mass immunization and direct mortality monitoring are both needed to achieve elimination of measles deaths in India . 4 Materials and methods Most deaths in India as in most low- and middle-income countries occur at home and without medical attention , precluding complete death registration and certification ( Registrar General of India , 2016 ) . Starting in 2001 , the Registrar General of India ( RGI ) and the Centre for Global Health Research implemented the MDS in 1 . 3 million households within its Sample Registration System ( SRS ) , an ongoing demographic surveillance system . Following each census , the RGI partitions India into 1 million small areas comprising 150–300 homes in either rural villages or urban census enumeration blocks . Over the ensuing decade , the SRS randomly selects and monitors several thousand units within these areas , capturing approximately 140 , 000 births and 46 , 000 deaths annually . This MDS relies on 14 , 268 units drawn from the 1991 and 2001 censuses ( Registrar General of India , 2016 ) . Approximately 900 trained non-medical RGI surveyors conduct two semi-annual rounds of interviews of household members or close associates of those who died in the preceding round . The interview uses a modified version of the 2011 WHO verbal autopsy questionnaire to capture death events and their chronology through structured checklist questions about key symptoms and a local language narrative . Each field report is randomly assigned to two of 404 trained physicians ( Jha et al . , 2008 ) , who classify the underlying causes of death according to the International Classification of Diseases , Tenth Revision ( ICD-10; Table 5 ) ( Jha et al . , 2006a; World Health Organization , 1992 ) . Coding differences are resolved by both physicians who anonymously receive the other’s case notes . One of 40 senior physicians adjudicates persisting differences ( Aleksandrowicz et al . , 2014 ) . Details of the quality assurance checks have been published earlier ( Aleksandrowicz et al . , 2014; Fadel et al . , 2017; Jha et al . , 2006a; Jha et al . , 2008; Registrar General of India , 2016; Bassani et al . , 2010 ) . Ethics approval for the MDS was obtained from the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Research , St . John’s Research Institute and St . Michael’s Hospital , Toronto , Ontario , Canada . Consent procedures have been published earlier ( Gomes et al . , 2017; Jha et al . , 2006a; Registrar General of India , 2016 ) . The main outcome was 1–59 month measles mortality using a case definition that required at least one physician reviewer of the verbal autopsy to code measles ( ICD-10 codes B01 or B05 ) as the cause of death or that the living respondent reporting a measles death noted a history of measles ( using the local language term ) ( Table 5 ) . Though the campaign targeted children from 9 months to 10 years of age , our analysis focuses on children aged 1–59 months who comprised 84% ( 1638/1958 ) of these deaths . We applied proportions of measles deaths to all-causes among 1–59 month children and calculated three-year moving averages weighted by SRS sampling probabilities for the 35 Indian states or territories . We applied these weighted proportions to live births and deaths for India at the national and state level ( derived from SRS vital statistics and census data ) and adjusted to match the national birth totals from the UN Population Division and death totals from UN Population Division’s Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation ( Fadel et al . , 2017 ) . We calculated rates for each six-month period as death counts were too low to separate into monthly data as semi-annual rates correspond to the frequency of survey collection conducted in the MDS . We conducted a multiple-group interrupted time series to assess the impact of measles campaign on 1–59 month measles mortality reduction . We arranged the data in a time series and divided the sample into time periods before and after campaign launch ( Ministry of Health and Family Welfare , 2010 ) . We used log transformed rates to account for potential nonlinearity . We calculated the average annual rate of reduction by India and by state using the linear association between log rate and time ( UNICEF , 2007 ) . We fitted the data using ordinary least squares linear segmented regression ( Linden , 2015 ) . As control deaths , we used injuries , congenital anomalies , and non-communicable diseases , each having ICD-10 code groupings as detailed in Table 5 ( Fadel et al . , 2017 ) . We selected various control groups by comparing their pre-intervention trends to that of measles , pneumonia , and diarrhoea ( Linden , 2015 ) . Control selection used a matching framework to match control deaths to our measles , pneumonia , or diarrhoea deaths based on balancing of the pre-intervention trend characteristics ( Linden , 2018 ) . The pre-intervention trends excluding 2009 deaths did not differ from control deaths ( p=0 . 9 ) . We assessed model validity by visual inspection of autocorrelation/partial autocorrelation functions and residuals . We stratified models by age groups , sex , and campaign states . In sensitivity analysis , we fitted additional models using alternate case definitions and intervention time points . We used multilevel logistic regression to examine characteristics of health-seeking behavior associated with measles mortality ( Larsen and Merlo , 2005 ) . We organized the data into a three-level hierarchical structure consisting of children ( first level ) nested within districts ( second level ) nested within states ( third level ) . We fitted random intercepts at the district and state level to account for regional variation . The predictors considered were: age at death , sex , year of birth , and residence in a measles campaign district . We also adjusted for state-level coverage estimates of measles vaccination ( defined in the National Family Health Survey and the District Level Household and Facility Survey as the percentage of children aged 12 to 23 months receiving any measles vaccine from routine immunization ) , vitamin A supplementation , oral rehydration supplementation , maternal literacy , and treatment-seeking for diarrhoea and pneumonia . We obtained the coverage data from Indian national surveys corresponding to our study period including the Government of India’s District Level Household Surveys ( DLHS; 2002–2004 , 2007–2008 and 2011–2012 ) and National Family Health Surveys ( NFHS; 2005–2006 , and 2013–2014 ) . Using these coverage indicators , we conducted a difference-in-differences analysis assessing the change in coverage indicators before and after campaign launch in campaign states versus non-campaign states . We report measures of association as odds ratios ( ORs; including 99% confidence intervals ) . We use area-level variances , median odds ratios , and intra-class correlations as measures of variation ( Table 6 ) ( Larsen and Merlo , 2005 ) . We constructed maps of 1–59 month measles mortality to determine the geographical distribution of measles mortality risk in India . We fitted the data using a generalized linear geostatistical model with integrated nested Laplace approximations . We adjusted for populations living in measles campaign districts and urban/rural residence . We used R version 3 . 5 . 1 for mapping . To estimate the magnitude of the intervention , we derived cumulative deaths differences using observed and expected measles mortality rates from the interrupted time series model . We extrapolated the expected rates using the pre-intervention trend from campaign launch to the end of the time series . We applied UN live births to their respective year and summed for the 2010–2013 period , then calculated deaths averted and percent averted between the observed deaths and the expected deaths . We report upper and lower bounds using the broad case definition , which captures one physician coding measles or family reporting of a history of measles , and the narrow case definitions , which captures only one physician coding measles . We used Stata version 15 for statistical analysis ."}

Canada is aiming to eliminate tuberculosis among the Inuit by 2030 . One way to help stop transmission and prevent future outbreaks is to trace how and where the disease spreads using DNA sequencing . This information can then be used by public health organizations to identify possible interventions . Typically , the DNA of the bacterium that causes tuberculosis – Mycobacterium tuberculosis , or Mtb for short – is sequenced 50–100 times and a consensus DNA sequence is then generated for each patient from this data . These consensus DNA sequences are then compared to help piece together who infected whom . Recently , scientists have realized that the bacteria a person is infected with may have different DNA sequences due to people being infected with more than one bacterium or the bacterium developing variations in its genome after the infection . However , current DNA sequencing practices may miss these differences , making it harder to trace how the disease spreads . Now , Lee et al . show that sequencing the DNA of Mtb from an infected person 500–1000 times ( i . e . ∼10-20 times more than usual ) makes it easier to detect genetic differences and determine how tuberculosis spreads . This approach , also known as ‘deep sequencing’ , was used to analyze DNA samples of Mtb collected from about 50 people during an outbreak of tuberculosis in 2011-2012 , which had previously undergone standard DNA sequencing . This deep sequencing approach identified a ‘super-spreading event’ where one person had likely transmitted tuberculosis to up to 17 others during the outbreak . Lee et al . found that most of these people had visited the same ‘gathering houses’ which are social venues in the community . Implementing targeted public health interventions at these sites may help stop future outbreaks . To fully understand how useful this method will be for tracking the spread of tuberculosis , deep and routine sequencing will need to be compared against each other in different settings and outbreaks . Furthermore , the approach used in this study may be useful for tracking the transmission of other infectious diseases .", "article": "1 Introduction Tuberculosis ( TB ) in Canada is highest among the Inuit , an Indigenous population with a rate over 300 times that of the non-Indigenous Canadian-born population in 2016 ( Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami , 2018 ) . Canada recently set a goal of TB elimination in the Inuit by 2030 , ( Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami , 2018 ) which will not be achieved without halting ongoing transmission . Previous studies have used genomic data either alone or in conjunction with classical epidemiology to investigate TB transmission dynamics in the Canadian North , ( Tyler et al . , 2017; Lee et al . , 2015a; Lee et al . , 2015b ) with the aim of identifying clusters to help guide public health interventions . Thus far , such studies have relied on identifying consensus single nucleotide polymorphisms ( cSNPs ) , consistent with prevailing methodology in this field . Recent studies suggest that incorporation of within-host diversity into genomic analyses may provide greater resolution of transmission than cSNP-based approaches alone ( Worby et al . , 2017; Martin et al . , 2018; Meehan et al . , 2019; Séraphin et al . , 2019 ) . This may be particularly important for investigation of outbreaks occurring over short time scales and/or in settings such as the Canadian North , where the genetic diversity of circulating strains is especially low . In both of these circumstances , it is common to find many samples separated by zero cSNPs , hindering accurate source ascertainment . To investigate this hypothesis , we used deep sequencing ( i . e . , to ~10-20 fold more than standard , or 500-1000x ) to re-evaluate transmission in a densely-sampled outbreak in Nunavik , Québec . This outbreak , which has been previously described , ( Lee et al . , 2015b; Lee et al . , 2016 ) comprised 50 microbiologically-confirmed cases of TB who were diagnosed in a single Inuit community between 2011–2012 - a rate of 5 , 359/100 , 000 for that year . Genomic epidemiology analyses using sequencing depths of ~50x that are standard in such work , identified multiple clusters of transmission in this outbreak , ( Lee et al . , 2015b ) however , there was insufficient genetic variation detected to infer precise person-to-person transmission events within these subgroups , given the short time frame and low mutation rate of M . tuberculosis ( ~0 . 2–0 . 3 SNPs/genome/year for Lineage 4; Menardo et al . , 2019 ) . In this study , we illustrate how within-host diversity can be incorporated into transmission analyses . In doing so , we find new features of the transmission networks in this community , in particular , identifying a previously unrecognized super-spreading event . We highlight a potential role for deep sequencing in public health investigations , with implications for TB control in Canada’s North as well as other high-transmission environments . 2 Materials and methods All 50 samples from the 2011–2012 outbreak ( Lee et al . , 2015b ) were eligible for inclusion , as well as samples from all cases ( n = 15 ) diagnosed in same village in the preceding five years ( 2007 onwards ) , 13/15 of which were caused by the same strain of M . tuberculosis ( the ‘Major [Mj]-III’ sublineage; Lee et al . , 2015a ) . There were two episodes of recurrent TB ( i . e . , where an individual had microbiologically-confirmed TB once , was cured , but developed TB again during the study period ) ; otherwise , all samples are from unique individuals . All cases had pulmonary TB that was Lineage 4 ( Euro-American; Lee et al . , 2015b ) . Cross-contamination was ruled out as described in Lee et al . ( 2015b ) . Samples were cultured once on Middlebrook 7H10 agar and plate sweeps were collected for DNA extraction using the van Soolingen method ( van Soolingen et al . , 1991 ) . Genomic DNA was quantified using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Assay ( ThermoFisher Scientific , Massachusetts , USA ) . Library preparation and sequencing were done at the McGill University/Genome Québec Innovation Centre . The Illumina HiSeq 4000 was used to produce paired-end 100 bp reads . To obtain the depth of coverage needed for this study ( ~500–1000x for deep sequencing , compared to ~50–100x as routinely done by public health ) , pooled libraries were run on four independent lanes . FastQC ( v . 0 . 11 . 5 , https://www . bioinformatics . babraham . ac . uk/projects/fastqc/ ) was used to assess sequencing data quality and reads were trimmed to remove low-quality bases using Trimmomatic ( v . 0 . 36 Bolger et al . , 2014 ) . Kraken ( v . 1 . 1 Wood and Salzberg , 2014 ) was then used to identify potential contamination with the miniKraken database ( minikraken_20171019 ) . Reads classified as ‘Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex’ ( MTBC ) were extracted using Seqtk ( v . 1 . 2 , Li H , available at: https://github . com/lh3/seqtk ) . Reads were then aligned using the Burrows Wheeler Aligner MEM algorithm ( v . 0 . 7 . 15 Li , 2013 ) to the H37Rv reference ( NC_000962 . 3 in the National Center for Biotechnology Information [NCBI] RefSeq database ) and sorted using Samtools ( v . 1 . 5 Li et al . , 2009 ) . Analyses were later repeated using a local reference genome ( described below ) . Reads were with ambiguous mappings were excluded , as were reads with excessive soft-clipping ( i . e . , more than 20% of read length ) based on our previous work ( Martin et al . , 2018 ) . Duplicate reads were marked using Picard MarkDuplicates ( v . 2 . 9 . 0 , https://broadinstitute . github . io/picard/ ) and reads were locally re-aligned around indels using Genome Analysis ToolKit ( GATK , v . 3 . 8 McKenna et al . , 2010 ) . All sites were called using GATK’s Unified Genotyper algorithm , with the -d 1500 to avoid downsampling to 250 ( done by default with this tool during variant calling ) . Variants ( cSNPs and heterogenous SNPs [hSNPs] ) versus H37Rv were annotated using snpEff ( v . 4 . 3t Cingolani et al . , 2012 ) . Variants were filtered for quality using custom Python scripts ( v . 3 . 6 ) with the following thresholds: Phred < 50 , Root Mean Squared Mapping Quality ( RMS-MQ ) ≤ 30 , depth ( DP ) < 20 , Fisher Strand Bias ( FS ) ≥ 60 and read position strand bias ( ReadPos ) < −8 ( Martin et al . , 2018 ) . cSNPs were classified as positions where ≥ 95% of reads were the alternative allele ( ALT ) , hSNPs were classified as positions where > 5% and < 95% of reads were ALT , and positions with the ALT present in ≤5% of reads were classified as ‘reference’ . We also compared inferences of transmission from this analysis to i ) when these thresholds were increased to the minimum values among cSNPs in the initial H37Rv analysis , and ii ) when cSNPs were classified using a threshold of ≥ 99% , and hSNPs were classified when 1% < ALT < 99% , in order to assess the robustness of inferences to different filtering protocols . Low-quality variants , variants in proline-proline-glutamic acid ( PE ) and proline-glutamic-acid/polymorphic-guanine-cytosine-rich sequence ( PE_PGRS ) genes , transposons , phage and integrase , and positions with missing data , were excluded . All samples were drug-susceptible , except for MT-6429 , which was rendered resistant to isoniazid by a frameshift deletion at position 1284 in the catalase-peroxidase gene katG . As such , positions associated with drug resistance were not masked in this analysis . Alignments with informative hSNPs were reviewed using Tablet ( v . 1 . 17 . 08 . 17 , Milne et al . , 2013 ) . Concatenated core cSNP alignments were made using snp-sites -c ( v . 2 . 4 . 0 Page et al . , 2016 ) , with positions with hSNPs excluded . Pairwise cSNP distances between samples were computed using snp-dists ( v . 0 . 6 , available at https://github . com/tseemann/snp-dists ) . The frequency of hSNPs at each position in the genome was tabulated and hSNPs were reviewed to identify variants shared between samples . Core cSNP alignments were used to generate maximum likelihood trees using IQ-Tree ( v . 1 . 6 . 8 Nguyen et al . , 2015 ) . Model selection was based on the lowest Bayesian Information Criterion . Hierarchical Bayesian Analysis of Population Structure ( Cheng et al . , 2013 ) was run in R ( v . 3 . 5 . 2 ) to identify clusters . Phylogenetic trees were visualized using Interactive Tree of Life ( Letunic and Bork , 2016 ) . To examine the influence of potential alignment errors in identification of hSNPs , we used SMRT sequencing with the PacBio RSII platform to create a local reference genome for the outbreak . Sample MT-0080 was chosen for sequencing because this was previously identified as the probable source for as many as 19 of the 50 cases diagnosed in 2011–2012 ( Lee et al . , 2015b ) . Prior to sequencing , the culture was grown on a Middlebrook 7H10 agar plate . A single colony was then selected and grown further in 3 mL of Middlebrook 7H9 Broth to provide sufficient DNA for SMRT sequencing and Illumina MiSeq ( for polishing of the long-read assembly ) . DNA for SMRT sequencing was extracted using the MagAttract High Molecular Weight DNA Kit from Qiagen ( Maryland , USA ) . High molecular weight fragments were verified using gel electrophoresis . Library preparation and sequencing were then done at the McGill University/Genome Québec Innovation Centre . Prior to sequencing , fragment size was evaluated using a BioAnalyzer and the BluePippin system ( Sage Science , Massachusetts , USA ) was used for size selection . DNA for Illumina MiSeq was extracted using the van Soolingen method , as previous ( van Soolingen et al . , 1991 ) . Long-reads were assembled and corrected using Canu ( v . 1 . 7 . 1 Koren et al . , 2017 ) . Pilon ( v . 1 . 23 Walker et al . , 2014 ) was then used to polish the assembly using the Illumina MiSeq reads from the same colony . This was re-run until no further corrections were possible . Quast ( v . 5 . 0 . 2 , Gurevich et al . , 2013 ) was used to evaluate assembly quality . RASTtk ( v . 2 . 0 Brettin et al . , 2015 ) was used for annotation , to identify regions for masking as previous . Epidemiological and clinical data were collected on all cases and contacts using standardized questionnaires as part of the routine public health response , described previously in Lee et al . ( 2015b ) ; Lee et al . ( 2016 ) . A two-sample test of proportions was used to compare overall proportions across references , and the Wilcoxon Signed Rank test was used to compare paired SNP distances . Analyses were done in Stata ( v . 15 , StataCorp , College Station , TX , USA ) . 3 Results The core cSNPs and hSNPs between samples are shown in Source data 6 , with the sub-groups identified in the original analysis indicated . Overlaying hSNPs with the cSNP-based analysis revealed a novel super-spreader ( MT-504 ) in Cluster Mj-IIIB , undetected by genomic epidemiology analyses relying on lower sequencing depth . ( Lee et al . , 2015b ) . In brief , our previous analysis using routine sequencing depth had suggested that Mj-IIIB was comprised of two distinct transmission networks ( which we refer to as ‘subgroups’ for consistency with our earlier work ) ; the first subgroup consisted of five cases diagnosed between December 2011 and October 2012 , while the second subgroup consisted of 13 cases diagnosed between March and November 2012 . Epidemiologic curves for these subgroups are given in Figure 2—figure supplement 1A . These two subgroups were distinguished from one another based on the presence or absence of a shared cSNP ( at position 276 , 685 according to H37Rv/276 , 544 in the MT-0080_PB alignment , Source datas 6 , 7 , 8 ) ; all samples in the subgroup of five cases shared an alternative ‘C’ allele at this position , while all samples in the subgroup of 13 cases shared the reference ‘A’ allele . Given the short time period , low mutation rate of TB , and overall low diversity of strains circulating in the village , we would expect 0 SNPs to accrue in recent transmission , refuting transmission between these subgroups . In the original analysis , MT-504 was identified as the probable source for the subgroup of five cases . This individual was diagnosed in late 2011 with smear-positive , cavitary disease , and had attended the same local community ‘gathering houses’ ( social venues specifically identified by public health during the outbreak ) as all four others in this subgroup . For the second subgroup of 13 cases , MT-2474 was identified as the probable source , as this was the first smear-positive case in this subgroup ( diagnosed in May 2012 , Figure 2—figure supplement 1A ) . In contrast to the analysis based on routine sequencing data , our in-depth investigation of within-host diversity using deep sequencing data revealed that MT-504 harboured both the alternative allele ( 563 reads [80·9%] ) shared by all members of the subgroup of five as well as the reference allele ( 133 reads [19·1%] ) , shared by all members of the subgroup of 13 ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1B ) . Given that MT-504 was the first contagious case diagnosed in Mj-IIIB ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1A ) , and all 13 cases in the second subgroup had attended or resided in a gathering house ( with 9/13 [69·2%] reporting attendance at the same houses as MT-504 ) , this strongly suggests that MT-504 is in fact the most probable source for both subgroups . Sample 68995 and MT-5543 were from 2007 , and were the only strains from the Mj-VA sub-lineage in this village . Previous analysis indicated Mj-VA strains from other villages were distantly related , ( Lee et al . , 2015b ) while these two samples were separated from one another by zero core cSNPs . This suggests direct transmission between these historical cases , a hypothesis strongly supported by hSNP analysis , as the samples share hSNPs that are not found in any other sample in the dataset . These hSNPs were present even when highly conservative filtering thresholds were used ( Source data 7 ) , but were not included when using H37Rv as the reference - potentially due to differences in annotation and subsequent filtering . Six individuals had TB recurrence in 2011–2012 . Paired samples were available for two of these ( Patient 1: samples MT-5195 [Mj-IIIA] in 2007 and MT-1838 [Mj-IIIC] in 2012; Patient 2: samples MT-5543 [Mj-VA] in 2007 and MT-1206 [Mj-IIIB] in 2012 , Figure 2 ) . Clinically , both patients had new lesions detected at their second episode , compared to their previous chest x-rays . cSNP-based analyses suggested their second episodes of TB were due to re-infection with a new strain , rather than relapse with the strain causing their original disease . Investigation of within-host diversity strongly supported this conclusion; using deep sequencing , we verified that there was a single , different strain present at both baseline and their second episodes of TB . There was no evidence for mixed infection at either baseline or second episode with these strains , more definitively ruling out relapse in this low diversity setting ( Source datas 6 , 7 , 8 ) . To ensure we were not missing lower frequency variants using the prior cSNP/hSNP thresholds , we re-ran our analysis such that hSNPs were classified when 1% < ALT < 99% . Quality scores for individual cSNPs and hSNPs are given in Source data 9 and the core cSNP/hSNP alignment is shown in Source data 8 . While our primary analysis using a threshold of ≥95% for cSNPs identified a single cSNP ( A to G ) shared across all samples compared to MT-0080_PB , close examination of the MT-0080 deep sequencing data ( obtained using DNA from a sweep of the plate ) showed that this sample had both alleles at this position , with only the minority ‘A’ allele ( 33 reads/1189 [2·8%] ) isolated for SMRT sequencing . Based on this , we recommend sequencing samples both using a clean sweep ( with an alternative sequencing platform ) and a single colony pick when generating a reference genome for TB , as using the latter alone may introduce error and affect epidemiological inferences . With this exception , no other informative hSNPs were detected using these thresholds . 4 Discussion As the TB epidemic continues among the Canadian Inuit , targeted public health interventions are essential to halt ongoing transmission . In order to do so , it is important that transmission events and associated risk factors are accurately identified . Our previous work suggested that hSNP analysis could enhance resolution of TB transmission ( Martin et al . , 2018 ) . To investigate how this approach could be applied for TB control , we used deep sequencing to re-examine a major TB outbreak in the Canadian Arctic . Several recent studies , including work by our group ( Martin et al . , 2018 ) , have shown that M . tuberculosis within-host diversity can be transmitted between individuals ( Séraphin et al . , 2019; Guthrie et al . , 2019 ) . Using deep sequencing data allowed us to better identify this diversity in a Nunavik outbreak compared to previous analyses with standard sequencing depth , ( Lee et al . , 2015a; Lee et al . , 2015b ) and facilitated detection of a novel super-spreading event , where one source case may have transmitted to ~1/3 of the other cases diagnosed between 2011 to 2012 . This was in addition to a previously identified super-spreader linked to 19 secondary cases - suggesting up to 75% of the outbreak ( 36/48 , excluding the putative super-spreaders ) may be attributable to these events . Super-spreading has been described in a number of pathogens , ( Stein , 2011 ) including TB ( Kline et al . , 1995 ) . Our findings suggest this can play an important role in driving TB outbreaks , and that accurate detection of super-spreading events is important for informing appropriate public health interventions . In the case of MT-504 , as nearly all of the secondary cases had attended the same local community gathering houses as the putative source , this strongly suggests these venues play an important role in facilitating transmission in this setting . Several studies have used genomics to investigate TB recurrence , ( Witney et al . , 2017; Bryant et al . , 2013; Guerra-Assunção et al . , 2015 ) however , the methods used to assess for mixed infection at either time point have been inconsistent and may not be sufficient to discriminate recurrence in settings with low strain diversity . In this analysis , we provide proof-of-principle that deep sequencing can potentially help rule out relapse . The distinction between relapse and re-infection is important at individual and population levels; high rates of relapse in a community would indicate a problem with treatment or adherence , potentially warranting changes to clinical management , while re-infection would indicate the need for public health interventions such as active case finding . Also , individuals in Nunavik who have had prior treatment for active TB disease in the past are also not routinely offered prophylaxis on re-exposure , based on historical data suggesting ~80% protection is afforded by prior infection ( Menzies , 1997 ) . The degree to which re-infection drives recurrence in Nunavik is currently unknown , but if re-infection is the primary cause , this clinical practice may need to be re-evaluated . A population-level genomic epidemiology study is currently underway to evaluate this . To use deep sequencing to investigate within-host diversity , it is critical we minimize false positive hSNPs . We have shown that using a local strain as a reference can not only reduce error , but improves detection of epidemiologically-informative variants . Genomic differences between outbreak strains and H37Rv have been previously illustrated by Roetzer et al . ( 2013 ) ; O'Toole and Gautam ( 2017 ) , with O'Toole and Gautam ( 2017 ) warning that clinical TB strains may be needed to fully detect virulence genes in reference-based analyses . Our analysis suggests these may also be warranted for hSNP analysis; where possible , we suggest using long-read sequencing to generate complete and local reference genomes . Overall , our study has a number of strengths . Firstly , we had access to a densely-sampled outbreak , which was previously investigated using ‘standard’ sequencing depth and for which detailed epidemiological data was available . This allowed us to readily compare methodological approaches , showing how and when deep sequencing might be beneficial for public health . In this study , we have also identified important methodological considerations for hSNP detection , with implications for transmission analyses , but also potentially for resistance prediction as well ( Liu et al . , 2015 ) . Finally , the use of long-read data has allowed us to completely assemble a novel TB genome from Nunavik . This will serve as a valuable resource for future studies of transmission in Nunavik ( given the low strain diversity in the region Lee et al . , 2015a ) , as well as other Inuit territories . A potential limitation of this work is that , given the historical nature of the outbreak , deep sequencing was done using DNA extracted from culture . Due to methodological challenges of sequencing directly from sputum , ( Brown et al . , 2015; Votintseva et al . , 2017; Doyle et al . , 2018 ) few studies have examined the effect of culture on genome diversity . A recent study by Shockey et al . ( 2019 ) . , which analyzed allelic variation among reads from individual samples , suggests that some diversity may be lost during the culturing process . However , several studies looking at potential transmission ( Votintseva et al . , 2017; Doyle et al . , 2018; Nimmo et al . , 2019 ) found results were congruent between cSNP analyses from culture versus raw samples . In terms of hSNPs , Votintseva et al . ( 2017 ) Doyle et al . ( 2018 ) ; Nimmo et al . ( 2019 ) reported detecting fewer hSNPs with sequencing from culture versus from sputum , in Nimmo et al . ( 2019 ) , the median hSNPs was only 4 . 5 versus 5 hSNPs , respectively – a difference that may not be clinically significant , regardless of statistical significance . Given the inconsistency of results and paucity of data , further study is needed to understand how hSNP diversity may be affected by the culturing process , and to assess whether this affects inferences of transmission . We note that it is likely that enhanced detection of the hSNPs present in sputum would improve the resolution over that which we present in this work . Another potential limitation is that , while we can compare the epidemiological inferences made between our previous analysis and our deep sequencing analysis , the sequencing data and bioinformatics pipelines themselves are not directly comparable . Methods to accurately identify hSNPs and incorporate them into transmission analyses are currently an area of active research . We illustrated in our recent paper ( Martin et al . , 2018 ) that additional steps and strict thresholds must be used to minimize false positive hSNPs , and have conducted the current analysis in consideration of this . However , we note that pre-filtering , our 2015 analysis found that MT-504 had five reference alleles at position 276 , 685 in the H37Rv alignment ( out of 75 ) and randomly downsampling the current data to simulate ~50 x yielded similar results ( 5/47 reads at position 276 , 544 aligned to MT-0080_PB ) . As most genomic studies of TB employ conservative thresholds of 75–90% allele frequency to classify cSNPs , many bioinformatics pipelines would consider this heterogeneity as potentially suspect at standard sequencing depth . This suggests that greater depth and/or different analytic approaches ( e . g . , Wyllie et al . , 2019 ) are needed to ensure accurate discrimination of sequencing/analytic error from true variation; ultimately , the optimal approach used to identify variants needs to be carefully considered , and appropriate for the study question and data being analyzed . Finally , while deep sequencing allowed us to detect a novel superspreading event in this context , this approach may not always be necessary; indeed , our previous analysis had identified another super-spreader in the same outbreak using routine sequencing . We acknowledge that this Northern outbreak may not be representative of outbreaks from other settings and/or involving other M . tuberculosis lineages . Further studies are needed to quantify the degree to which super-spreading occurs in TB , and examine how and when deep sequencing should be used to detect this . In summary , we have found evidence of mixed variants with important epidemiologic implications that would not have been detected with standard methods and common filtering criteria . To our knowledge , however , no other studies have been published comparing epidemiological inferences obtained with deep versus routine sequencing for TB outbreak resolution – thus this work represents an important methodological advance in this area . We illustrate that genomic methods , while powerful , still require careful interpretation and can still harbor considerable ambiguity when comparing very close links in a transmission chain , or , as also suggested in Xu et al . ( 2019 ) , when trying to identify source cases . This finding is likely relevant beyond TB , given the increasing number of pathogens undergoing genomic investigation . Our work also highlights the importance of reproducing previous genomic epidemiology analyses; as the technology and methods used in this field continue to develop , these can lead to improved resolution of transmission and ultimately , challenge previously-held inferences – with critical implications for public health . In terms of TB control , we demonstrate that deep sequencing can aid in transmission analyses , in particular by allowing accurate identification of TB super-spreading events and associated epidemiological characteristics . We propose that deep sequencing is most useful for understanding transmission in settings with low strain diversity , and that these may benefit from routine use of this approach . We hypothesize deep sequencing may also provide additional resolution of transmission events within outbreaks occurring over short , limited timescales – irrespective of local strain diversity , as ( by definition ) all samples involved in recent transmission would be expected to be closely-related . However , further studies comparing deep versus routine sequencing , ideally from a diversity of clusters and epidemiologic contexts , are needed to fully quantify the added value of this approach for epidemiologic studies of TB . Overall , this work has important implications for the Canadian North , as well as other regions with high TB transmission; as next-generation sequencing becomes a mainstay in public health surveillance , it is critical we recognize the limitations of analyses done using routine sequencing data . Accurate resolution of transmission is essential for TB control programmes , in order to better understand risk factors for such transmission and enable prioritization of public health resources . With respect to Nunavik , our findings were regarded as very valuable by the regional public health unit and local community leaders; as a direct consequence of this work , ongoing and new investigations of TB genomic epidemiology in Nunavik are using deep sequencing to inform transmission analyses . However , while costs continue to decline , we recognize deep sequencing of all samples in an outbreak may not be economically viable in every setting ."}

Here , we analyze their functional divergence using cellular co-culture assays , biochemical studies , and in vivo experiments . DLL1 and DLL4 activate NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 differently in cell-based assays and this discriminating potential lies in the region between the N-terminus and EGF repeat three . Mice expressing chimeric ligands indicate that the ectodomains dictate ligand function during somitogenesis , and that during myogenesis even regions C-terminal to EGF3 are interchangeable . Substitution of NOTCH1-interface residues in the MNNL and DSL domains of DLL1 with the corresponding amino acids of DLL4 , however , does not disrupt DLL1 function in vivo . Collectively , our data show that DLL4 preferentially activates NOTCH1 over NOTCH2 , whereas DLL1 is equally effective in activating NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 , establishing that the ectodomains dictate selective ligand function in vivo , and that features outside the known binding interface contribute to their differences .", "plain language summary": "A small number of signaling systems control how an animal develops from a single cell into a complex organism made up of many different cell types . Signals pass back and forth between cells , switching genes on and off to direct the development of tissues and organs . One of these signaling systems , called Notch , is so ancient that it appears in nearly all multicellular organisms . A cell sends a Notch signal using proteins called Delta or Jagged ligands that span membrane of the cell , so that part of the protein sits inside the cell and part remains outside . To change the behavior of another cell , the ligands bind to proteins called Notch receptors that span the membrane of the receiving cell . Mammals have two types of Delta ligand , two types of Jagged ligand and four types of Notch receptor . Cells in different tissues display different combinations of these eight proteins . Two Delta ligands called DLL1 and DLL4 often appear together in developing organisms . Some tissues need both and some only the one or the other . In some cases one ligand can compensate if the other is missing , but in others not . It was not clear why this is , or which parts of the proteins are responsible . Tveriakhina et al . used mouse cells to investigate how DLL1 and DLL4 interact with two Notch receptors , called NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 . The results of these experiments show that while DLL1 can bind and activate both Notch receptors equally , DLL4 prefers to partner with NOTCH1 . To find out which parts of the ligands are responsible for this selectivity , Tveriakhina et al . created hybrid ligands that contained a mixture of regions from DLL1 and DLL4 . These suggest that the different binding preferences depend on parts of the ligands that sit outside cells and that lie outside the known sites of binding contact with the Notch receptors . Further experiments studied mice that had been engineered to produce hybrid ligands as replacements for DLL1 . A hybrid ligand consisting of the part of DLL1 that sits outside cells and the part of DLL4 found inside cells generated Notch signals in the tissue that depended on the activity of DLL1 . However , a hybrid consisting of the part of DLL4 that sits outside cells and the part of DLL1 found inside cells did not , showing that in developing mice the parts that sit outside the cells contribute to the different functions of DLL1 and DLL4 . Overall , the results presented by Tveriakhina et al . show that interactions between specific ligands and receptors play important roles in how mammals develop . Further efforts to understand which parts of the ligands affect selectivity could ultimately allow researchers to develop ways to modify how ligands and receptors interact . Such “molecular engineering” strategies could enable cell responses to be precisely controlled by pairing designer ligand-receptor pairs to develop cell-based therapies .", "article": "1 Introduction The Notch signaling pathway mediates communication between neighboring cells in metazoans and thereby regulates a multitude of developmental processes in various tissues ( Artavanis-Tsakonas et al . , 1995; Yoon and Gaiano , 2005; Bolós et al . , 2007; Gridley , 2007; Radtke et al . , 2010; Koch and Radtke , 2011; reviewed in Louvi and Artavanis-Tsakonas , 2012; Kopan , 2012 ) . This communication depends on the interaction of Notch receptors on the surface of the signal receiving cells with transmembrane ligands on the surface of adjacent cells . Ligand binding then leads to a sequence of proteolytic cleavages of the receptor releasing the Notch intracellular domain ( NICD ) from the membrane . NICD translocates into the nucleus where it enters into a complex with a CSL protein ( CBF-1/RBPJ in mammals , Suppressor of Hairless in flies , and Lag-1 in worms ) and a protein of the Mastermind family ( Petcherski and Kimble , 2000; Wu et al . , 2000; Nam et al . , 2003; Nam et al . , 2006; Wilson and Kovall , 2006; Choi et al . , 2012 ) to regulate transcription of target genes ( reviewed in Bray , 2016 ) . Mammals have four Notch receptors ( N1-N4 ) and four activating ligands of the DSL ( Delta , Serrate , LAG-2 ) family: DLL1 and DLL4 , orthologs of Drosophila Delta , and JAG1 and JAG2 , orthologs of Drosophila Serrate . DLL1 and DLL4 are similar in domain structure , size and sequence ( Shutter et al . , 2000 ) . Both proteins contain an N-terminal MNNL ( also referred to as C2 ) domain ( Chillakuri et al . , 2013; Suckling et al . , 2017 ) , followed by a DSL domain and eight EGF-like repeats in their extracellular portion , and a less well conserved intracellular domain . The MNNL and DSL domains , required for high-affinity binding of Delta-like ligands to Notch receptors ( Rebay et al . , 1991; Cordle et al . , 2008 ) , contact EGF repeats 12 and 11 of Notch , respectively ( Luca et al . , 2015 ) . Contributions from adjacent EGF-like repeats , however , are required for signal transduction by Delta-like ligands ( Andrawes et al . , 2013 ) as well as for optimal interaction with Serrate ( Yamamoto et al . , 2012 ) and Jagged ( JAG ) -family ligands ( Luca et al . , 2017 ) . Although the biological activities of DLL1 and DLL4 are partially overlapping , the two proteins are not equivalent in vitro or in vivo . In cell culture studies , DLL4 is more effective than DLL1 in activating N1 signaling during T cell development ( Besseyrias et al . , 2007 ) , consistent with its ten-fold higher binding affinity in binding studies using purified fragments of N1 , DLL1 , and DLL4 ( Andrawes et al . , 2013 ) . In vivo , studies of adult intestinal epithelium in mice have shown that DLL1 and DLL4 are co-expressed in crypts and act redundantly to maintain the intestinal stem cell pool ( Pellegrinet et al . , 2011 ) . In contrast , however , mouse DLL1 cannot fully replace DLL4 in its ability to trigger T lineage commitment ( Besseyrias et al . , 2007; Mohtashami et al . , 2010 ) . Conversely , endogenous DLL4 does not substitute for DLL1 in its ability to promote development of the arterial vascular epithelium ( Sörensen et al . , 2009 ) , nor does it compensate for the function of DLL1 in the paraxial mesoderm , a tissue where these ligands are normally not co-expressed: mice in which DLL1 was replaced by DLL4 had severe somite patterning defects and showed premature myogenic differentiation leading to reduced skeletal muscles . However , the function of DLL1 during early retina development was rescued by DLL4 in these mice ( Preuße et al . , 2015 ) . Collectively these studies indicate that the functionality of DLL1 and DLL4 strongly depends on context , but it remains unclear which portions of these similar DSL proteins account for their functional non-equivalence . A recent study in cell culture observed that DLL1 and DLL4 stimulate NOTCH1 receptors to produce responses with different dynamics , attributing differences between pulsatile signaling of DLL1 and sustained signaling by DLL4 to the intracellular , rather than the extracellular , regions of the proteins ( Nandagopal et al . , 2018 ) . Here , we investigate the influence of the extracellular and intracellular regions of DLL1 and DLL4 chimeric proteins on ligand function in cell culture assays , and for selected chimeras , in biochemical binding assays and in vivo in mice . We observe that in vivo differences of DLL1 and DLL4 function during somite patterning and myogenesis are encoded by the ligands ectodomains , that DLL1 and DLL4 are able to discriminate between NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 in vitro , and that ligand residues outside of the known binding interface are important contributing factors for ligand function in vivo . 2 Results Previous in vivo analyses indicated that DLL4 cannot substitute for DLL1 function during embryonic development ( Preuße et al . , 2015 ) . To test whether the inability of DLL4 to rescue the loss of DLL1 in the paraxial mesoderm in vivo resides in its extra- or intracellular domain we generated single copy transgenic mice allowing for the conditional expression of chimeric DLL molecules consisting of the extracellular domain of one ligand and transmembrane and intracellular domain of the other ( D1ECD_D4ICD and D4ECD_D1ICD , II and VII in Figure 1 ) . Transgenes were introduced into the Hprt locus of Hprt-deficient E14TG2a ES cells by homologous recombination using the strategy already employed for the initial analysis of full length DLL1 and DLL4 during somitogenesis ( Preuße et al . , 2015 ) . Briefly , cDNAs encoding chimeric ligands were cloned into the targeting vector pMP8 in reverse orientation downstream of neomycin phosphotransferase ( neor ) driven by the CAG promoter . Cre-mediated recombination of two loxP sites and two mutant loxP2272 ( loxM ) sites removes the neor cassette and flips the gene of interest and results in its expression from the CAG promoter ( Figure 2A ) . To test whether the extracellular or intracellular domain determines the inability of DLL4 to rescue the loss of DLL1 in mesodermal tissues of early embryos , we induced expression of either chimeric ligand and simultaneously removed endogenous DLL1 using a floxed Dll1 allele and a Cre transgene expressed in the primitive streak driven by a promoter derived from brachyury ( T ( s ) :Cre ) ( Feller et al . , 2008 ) . Because the Hprt locus is located on the X-chromosome , we used hemizygous male embryos for the analysis . As previously described , inactivation of Dll1 in the mesoderm resulted in loss of Uncx ( formerly called Uncx4 . 1 ) expression in caudal somite compartments ( n = 12; Figure 2Bb , b' ) indicating severe somite patterning defects compared to wild type embryos ( n = 28; Figure 2Ba , a' ) . Expression of D1ECD_D4ICD in Dll1-deficient embryos ( n = 9 ) restored robust expression of Uncx similar to full length DLL1 ( Preuße et al . , 2015 ) . Uncx expression expanded into cranial somite compartments ( Figure 2Bc , c' ) reminiscent of ectopic Notch activity ( Feller et al . , 2008 ) , probably reflecting non-restricted D1ECD_D4ICD expression throughout the PSM and somites . In contrast , expression of D4ECD_D1ICD barely restored Uncx expression in the majority ( n = 8/12 ) of Dll1-deficient embryos ( Figure 2Bd , d' ) , a phenotype similar to that seen with full-length DLL4 ( Preuße et al . , 2015 ) , even though the chimeric ligand was expressed and detected on the cell surface of PSM cells ( Figure 2Cd-f ) . As observed previously for full-length DLL4 ( Preuße et al . , 2015 ) some embryos ( n = 4 ) displayed essentially normal Uncx expression ( not shown ) , which might result from some perdurance of DLL1 activity or delayed or inefficient excision of endogenous Dll1 . Overall , this analysis strongly suggests that the functional difference between DLL1 and DLL4 observed in vivo during somitogenesis resides in the extracellular domains . The N-terminal MNNL and DSL domains and adjacent EGF repeats 1–3 constitute the major interface for interaction between DSL ligands and Notch receptors , and are essential for ( full ) activation of Notch signaling ( Cordle et al . , 2008; Andrawes et al . , 2013; Luca et al . , 2015; Schuster-Gossler et al . , 2016; Luca et al . , 2017 ) . To analyze whether this region accounts for the observed differences between DLL1 and DLL4 in vivo we generated a chimeric ligand that contained the N-terminal region up to and including EGF3 of DLL1 fused to EGF4 and the remaining C-terminal portion of DLL4 ( D1N-E3_D4 , III in Figure 1; the amino acid sequence around the fusion is shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1Ab ) . We then tested whether this chimeric ligand is sufficient for normal DLL1 function during development . We generated mice ( Dll1D1N-E3_D4ki ) expressing D1N-E3_D4 instead of DLL1 using the \"mini-gene“ knock-in strategy ( Figure 3A ) that disrupts endogenous Dll1 , successfully employed previously to express either a Dll4 or Dll1 ( control ) mini-gene ( Schuster-Gossler et al . , 2007; Preuße et al . , 2015; Schuster-Gossler et al . , 2016 ) . Heterozygous mice obtained from two independent targeting events carrying the Dll1D1N-E3_D4ki allele were viable and showed no apparent phenotype . Homozygous Dll1D1N-E3_D4ki mice were stillborn ( n = 3 and 4 , respectively ) , indicating that D1N-E3_D4 cannot fully replace DLL1 during development although it is present on the cell surface of PSM cells ( Figure 3Cd-f ) . At E15 . 5 homozygous Dll1D1N-E3_D4ki fetuses showed a stumpy tail ( n = 5 and 6 , respectively; arrow in Figure 3Bb ) similar to Dll1Dll4ki mutants ( Figure 3Bd ) ; however , they lacked the edema observed in Dll1Dll4ki homozygotes ( arrowhead in Figure 3Bd ) . D1N-E3_D4 was also not able to restore normal Uncx expression ( Figure 3De ) . Axial skeletons of homozygous Dll1D1N-E3_D4ki fetuses were severely disorganized ( n = 10; Figure 3Ef ) , a phenotype consistent with abnormal Uncx expression and similar to Dll1Dll4ki/Dll4ki homozygote axial skeletons ( Figure 3Ed ) , although the rib cage appeared less compressed . In contrast to Dll1Dll4ki heterozygotes ( Figure 3Ec; Preuße et al . , 2015 ) , which often displayed axial skeleton defects ( n = 14/16 ) such as hemivertebrae ( arrow in Figure 3Ec ) and fused ribs ( arrowheads in Figure 3Ec ) heterozygous Dll1D1N-E3_D4ki fetuses showed no defects of the axial skeleton ( n = 0/14; Figure 3Ee ) indicating that D1N-E3_D4 lacks the dominant interfering activity of DLL4 . Deletion of DLL1 during myogenesis leads to premature differentiation of myogenic progenitor cells resulting in severe skeletal muscle hypotrophy at fetal stages ( Schuster-Gossler et al . , 2007 ) . This phenotype cannot be suppressed by DLL4 expression ( Figure 3Fc; Preuße et al . , 2015 ) . In contrast , skeletal muscles of Dll1D1N-E3_D4ki/D1N-E3_D4ki homozygotes ( Figure 3Fd-f; n = 3 ) were virtually indistinguishable from Dll1Dll1ki/Dll1ki ( Figure 3Fb ) and wild type fetuses ( Figure 3Fa ) . These in vivo analyses indicate that , unlike the D1ECD_D4ICD chimera , D1N-E3_D4 is not a fully functional DLL1 ligand during somite patterning . However , D1N-E3_D4 remains functional during myogenesis and restricts muscle progenitor differentiation despite the presence of the DLL4 ICD , consistent with the conclusion that in vivo the functional difference between DLL1 and DLL4 is encoded in the ECDs . In cell-based trans-activation assays using HeLa cells stably expressing murine N1 ( HeLaN1 ) co-cultured with CHO cells expressing mouse DLL1 ( mDLL1 ) or DLL4 from the same locus both ligands activated a transiently expressed Notch reporter similarly ( Preuße et al . , 2015 ) . However , a purified fragment of the extracellular domain of human DLL4 ( N-terminus up to and including EGF5: hD4N-E5 ) bound to hN1 with an approximately ten-fold higher affinity than the corresponding hDLL1 fragment ( Andrawes et al . , 2013 ) . Like hD4N-E5 , mD4N-E5 has a higher affinity for hN1 ( KD = 0 . 43 ± 0 . 046 µM; Figure 1—figure supplement 2Aa ) than the corresponding mDLL1 fragment ( KD = 1 . 56 ± 0 . 207 µM; Figure 1—figure supplement 2Ab ) , as judged by biolayer interferometry measurements . To find a potential explanation for the discrepancy between binding affinities and Notch activation in HeLaN1 cells we analyzed these cells for expression of other Notch receptors and found that in addition to exogenous mouse Notch1 HeLaN1 cells express endogenous NOTCH2 and NOTCH3 ( Figure 4A ) , which might have masked underlying differences in the intrinsic N1 response to the DLL1 and DLL4 ligands . To detect potential differences in ligand activity towards N1 or N2 , the two Notch receptors present during somitogenesis , and to reduce variability due to transient reporter expression we stably integrated a Notch luciferase reporter in the Hprt locus ( E14rep ) of mouse E14TG2a ES ( E14 ) cells , and generated stable cell lines expressing either Notch1 ( N1rep ) or Notch2 ( N2rep ) in these cells ( Schuster-Gossler et al . , 2016 ) . When co-cultured with E14 cells or DLL1 or DLL4 expressing cells , E14rep cells show luciferase activity similar to wild type E14 levels ( compare I to II , III , and IV in Figure 4B; numerical values in Figure 4—source data 1 ) , indicating that negligible amounts of functional endogenous NOTCH receptors are present in E14 cells . Likewise , N1rep cells show essentially no activation above background when co-cultured with wild type E14 ES cells ( compare V to I in Figure 4B; numerical values in Figure 4—source data 1 ) , indicating insignificant amounts of functional endogenous Notch ligands in these cells . ES cells expressing exogenous DLL1 activate the luciferase reporter approximately ten-fold above the basal signal in E14 ES cells when co-cultured with N1rep cells ( compare VI to V in Figure 4B; numerical values in Figure 4—source data 1 ) indicating that our co-culture system reliably measures specific Notch signaling activity . To create ligand presenting cells for a comparison between mDLL1 and mDLL4 , we generated ES cells expressing either mDLL1 or mDLL4 from single copy integrations into the Hprt locus . Co-cultures ( n = 39 ) of cells expressing DLL1 or DLL4 with N1rep ES cells consistently revealed higher activation of N1 by DLL4 than by DLL1 ( mean 12 . 454 ± 3 . 961 SD fold of non-normalized luciferase activity , 9 . 42 ± 2 . 997 SD fold , when normalized to DLL1 activation and corrected for protein expression and cell surface levels ( Figure 4C–E; numerical values Figure 4—source data 2 , Figure 4—source data 3 , Figure 4—source data 4 ) . In contrast , DLL4 activated N2 significantly less efficiently than did DLL1 ( n = 39; mean 0 . 468 ± 0 . 161 SD fold of non-normalized luciferase activity , 0 . 35 ± 0 . 12 SD fold , when normalized to DLL1 activation and corrected for protein expression and cell surface levels ( Figure 4F; numerical values in Figure 4—source data 5 ) . To confirm that the observed differences between DLL1 and DLL4 in activating N1 and N2 were not a secondary consequence of clonal selection ( however unlikely ) , we also analyzed additional DLL1 ( n = 3 ) and DLL4 ( n = 9 ) expressing ES cell clones for protein expression and N1 or N2 activation . Despite some variability of protein expression ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1B and Figure 4—figure supplement 1—source data 1 ) and Notch activation levels between individual clones and co-cultures , all DLL4 clones consistently activated N1 significantly better than all DLL1 clones , and all DLL4 clones stimulated N2 significantly less efficiently than DLL1 ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1C , D; numerical values in Figure 4—figure supplement 1—Source Data 2 ) , indicating that both ligands differ significantly in their ability to activate different Notch receptors in our cell-based assay . Consistent with the differences in N2 stimulation by mDLL1- and mDLL4-expressing cells , the highly homologous human hD1N-E5 exhibits a higher affinity ( KD = 0 . 36 ± 0 . 11 µM; Figure 1—figure supplement 2Ba ) for human NOTCH2 than D4N-E5 ( KD = 1 . 28 ± 0 . 2 µM; Figure 1—figure supplement 2Bb ) . In an attempt to identify the domains of DLL1 and DLL4 that contribute to differences in activating N1 and N2 , we carried out a series of domain swaps to generate a set of chimeric ligands ( II-V , VII-X in Figure 1 ) for stimulation of N1 and N2-expressing cells in our co-culture assay . Like wild-type ligands , chimeric ligands were expressed from single copy transgene integrations in the Hprt locus of murine ES cells . All chimeric proteins were expressed and present on the cell surface ( Supplementary file 1 ) , but expression levels varied among the chimeras ( Supplementary file 2 ) despite integration into the Hprt locus by homologous recombination . We thus analyzed receptor selectivity of the chimeras in stimulating N1 and N2 responses using the co-culture assay by determining the N1/N2 response ratio . Stimulation with DLL1 gives a N1/N2 response ratio of approximately 1 , DLL4 of ~20 ( Figure 5A; numerical values used for calculations in Figure 5—source data 1 , Figure 5—source data 2 , Figure 5—source data 3; graphical representations of the relative luciferase activities of the ligands are shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) . Strikingly , chimeras which retain the full ectodomain or the MNNL-EGF3 region of DLL4 have a N1/N2 stimulation ratio of approximately 20 similar to DLL4 , whereas chimeras that retain the ectodomain , or MNNL-EGF3 region of DLL1 have a stimulation ratio of between one and two , resembling DLL1 ( Figure 5A ) . These results indicate that the differences in activation potential of DLL4 and DLL1 toward N1 and N2 are encoded in the N-terminal part of the protein , encompassed by MNNL-EGF3 . When chimeras include the MNNL-EGF2 or MNNL-DSL region of one ligand and the remainder of the other , the N1/N2 stimulation ratios of the chimeric pairs are equivalent ( Figure 5A ) , indicating that the third EGF-like repeat makes an important contribution to receptor selectivity . To analyze to what extent the amino acids that contact N1 in the binding interfaces of the MNNL and DSL domains might contribute to the different activity of DLL1 and DLL4 toward N1 and N2 we reciprocally exchanged these amino acids ( XI-XII in Figure 1; Figure 5C and Figure 1—figure supplement 1B ) based on alignments of the DLL4 ( Luca et al . , 2015 ) and DLL1 ( Kershaw et al . , 2015 ) structures ( Figure 5B ) . Western blot analyses of cell lysates and cell surface biotinylation and immunoprecipitation showed that all variants were present on the cell surface ( Supplementary File 1 ) . The N1/N2 response ratios show that swapping the contact residues of DLL4 onto DLL1 do not substantially affect the activation ratio when compared to DLL1 itself , indicating that the differences between DLL1 and DLL4 in N1/N2 selectivity cannot simply be accounted for by interfacial residues in the MNNL-DSL region ( Figure 5D; numerical values used for calculations are in Figure 5—source data 1 , Figure 5—source data 2 , Figure 5—source data 3 ) . Similarly , replacement of the DLL4 contact residues by the analogous residues of DLL1 slightly reduces the mean N1/N2 activation ratio ( to ~13 ) , but does not collapse the ratio to 1 ( Figure 5D ) , again strongly suggesting that residues outside of the MNNL-DSL contact interface contribute to the relative N1 selectivity of DLL4 . These results are consistent with 1 ) the domain swap data , which argue that discrimination between DLL1 and DLL4 depends on the EGF repeats as well as on the MNNL-DSL region , and 2 ) the prior observation that variants of DLL4 selected for high N1 affinity accumulate mutations in the protein core , but not in the binding interface ( Luca et al . , 2015 ) . Swapping the contact residues of DLL1 onto DLL4 did not reduce the binding affinity of DLL4 for N1 ( D4contD1 KD = 0 . 327 ± 0 . 036 µM; Figure 1—figure supplement 2Ac ) , fully consistent with the interpretation that the protein core of DLL4 contributes to N1 binding affinity , likely by influencing the fraction of molecules in a binding-active conformation . Although swapping the contact residues of DLL4 onto DLL1 increased binding affinity for N1 ( D1contD4 KD = 0 . 326 ± 0 . 044 µM; Figure 1—figure supplement 2Ad ) , the substitution did not substantially change the N1/N2 activation ratio , indicating that binding affinity for N1 is not the only influence on the selectivity of the two ligands for N1 or N2 . The DLL4 MNNL domain contains three N-glycosylation sites , one of which ( N109 ) is conserved from amphibian to mammalian DLL4 ligands but absent in DLL1 . This residue resides adjacent to the contact amino acid F110 ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3A ) . We confirmed that DLL4 can actually be N-glycosylated at this site ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3C ) and tested whether N109-glycosylation contributes to DLL4 activity and selectivity by mutating N109 to G ( XIII in Figure 1 ) , which is the amino acid present in DLL1 in the equivalent position ( G112 ) . D4N109G had no effect on the relative activation potential of DLL4 for N1 versus N2 ( Figure 5D ) , and its affinity for N1 was not altered ( KD = 0 . 341 ± 0 . 015 µM; Figure 1—figure supplement 2Ae ) , indicating that N-glycosylation at this site does not significantly modulate N1 binding or contribute to the relative selectivity of DLL4 towards N1 and N2 . To test whether the contact amino acids of DLL1 and DLL4 contribute to their functional divergence in vivo we generated a mouse line expressing D1contD4 ( XI in Figure 1 ) instead of wild type DLL1 using our \"mini-gene\" knock-in strategy ( Figure 3A ) . Heterozygous mice carrying this allele ( Dll1D1contD4ki ) are indistinguishable from wild type . Homozygous mutants obtained from heterozygous matings at the expected Mendelian ratio ( 6/27 ) were viable and fertile , and indistinguishable from wild type and Dll1Dll1ki/Dll1ki controls ( Figure 6A ) . Uncx was expressed in regular pattern in the caudal halves of the somites of homozygous embryos ( Figure 6Cd , d’ ) , consistent with only subtle abnormalities of individual vertebral bodies in the lower thoracic region of Dll1D1contD4ki/D1contD4ki fetuses ( Figure 6D; n = 3/4 ) indicating that the contact amino acids and different binding affinities are not a major discriminating feature of the two ligands in vivo . 3 Discussion DLL1 and DLL4 have context-dependent redundant and divergent functions , but the bases for these differences are unclear . Here , using systematic domain exchanges and mutation of contact amino acids in the MNNL and DSL domains of DLL1 and DLL4 , cell-based and biochemical assays , and transgenic mice we show that ( 1 ) DLL1 and DLL4 differ significantly in their potential to activate N1 and N2 and this difference is encoded in the ligand ectodomains , ( 2 ) regions outside the known contact interface contribute to context-dependent ligand function , and ( 3 ) the contact amino acids are not the sole or primary determinant of this discrimination between the two receptors . Analysis of our transgenic mice expressing D1ECD_D4ICD or D4ECD_D1ICD indicate a critical role of the ECD for the function of DLL1 during somite patterning in vivo . This resembles intrinsic functional differences that reside in the extracellular domains of mN1 and mN2 during kidney development ( Liu et al . , 2013 ) , whereas the N1 and N2 ICDs appear to be functionally equivalent in various developmental contexts ( Liu et al . , 2015 ) . Functional equivalence of DLL1’s and DLL4’s ICDs in vivo is further supported by the rescue of the skeletal muscle phenotype in our D1N-E3_D4 knock-in mice , which harbor the DLL4 ICD . In this developmental context even domains C-terminal to EGF3 of DLL1 appear to be interchangeable . Analyses of the ECD/ICD domain swaps in the cell-based assay also suggest that the discriminatory potential of the ligands tracks with the ECD , and not with the ICD , even though the ICD appears to affect the strength and/or dynamics of the signal in co-culture assays where ligand and receptor expression is enforced in vitro ( Nandagopal et al . , 2018 ) . Additional sources of complexity in vivo , like the stronger cis-inhibitory potential of the DLL4 ECD on Notch signaling ( Preuße et al . , 2015 ) , or cyclic modulation of Notch by LFNG in the paraxial mesoderm , or different interactions with lipids ( Suckling et al . , 2017 ) might account for the resistance to loss of function phenotypes from ligand ICD swaps in vivo . EGF-like repeats 11 and 12 of mouse N1 and N2 are highly similar ( 56/83 residues identical , 14 similar amino acids ) , and 13 of the 17 amino acid residues at the DLL4-binding interface are identical . Moreover , the x-ray structures of the EGF11-13 fragments of human N1 and N2 adopt a very similar arrangement ( Suckling et al . , 2017 ) . Nevertheless , DLL1 and DLL4 exhibit a \"discrimination potential\" of ~20 fold in terms of receptor response in culture assays , suggesting that either the few different contact amino acids in EGF 11 and 12 of N1 and N2 have a significant impact or interactions of DLL1 and DLL4 with N1 and N2 are not limited to the MNNL and DSL interfaces with receptor EGF repeats 11 and 12 . Domain swaps carried out here show that the region responsible for this receptor discrimination maps to the MNNL-EGF3 region ( Figure 5 ) . These findings are consistent with previous work uncovering the requirement of EGF repeats 1–3 of the DLL ligands for NOTCH1 activation , the importance of this region in the binding of Serrate family ligands to Notch receptors and in Serrate/Jagged-induced signaling , and the importance of EGF repeats 8–10 of NOTCH1 for signal activation by DLL ligands ( Shimizu et al . , 1999; Cordle et al . , 2008; Yamamoto et al . , 2012; Andrawes et al . , 2013; Schuster-Gossler et al . , 2016; Luca et al . , 2017; Liu et al . , 2017 ) . Together , this body of work suggests that interactions of the N-terminal EGF repeats of the DLL ligands with EGF repeats 8–10 of Notch also contribute to recognition and impart discriminatory potential . The D1N-E3_D4 knock-in mice also point a functional role for domains outside the known binding interface , since this chimeric ligand does not substitute fully for DLL1 in vivo during somite patterning despite harboring the MNNL and DSL domains and EGF1-3 of DLL1 , supporting context-dependent contributions of additional C-terminal EGF repeats observed previously in mice ( Schuster-Gossler et al . , 2016 ) . Remarkably , the exchange of the contact amino acids in DLL1 with those of DLL4 in the D1contD4 protein does not alter receptor selectivity in cultured cells even though these changes increase N1 binding affinity . This result suggests that receptor selectivity of DLL1 and DLL4 is not determined exclusively by the differences in binding strength . The D1contD4 chimera even substitutes almost completely for DLL1 function in mice during somite patterning , which is highly sensitive to altered Notch signaling ( Schuster-Gossler et al . , 2009 ) and therefore a suitable in vivo read out to detect even minor differences of Notch ligand function . Together , our results also favor the conclusion that the contact amino acids in the MNNL and DSL domains do not make the dominant contributions to the functional divergence of DLL1 and DLL4 in vivo , suggesting instead that differences in the domain cores , and/or contacts outside of the known DLL4-NOTCH1 interface , are the factors that most contribute to this functional divergence ."}
{"doi": "elife-05334-v2", "abstract": "The lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) forms the surface-exposed leaflet of the outer membrane ( OM ) of Gram-negative bacteria , an organelle that shields the underlying peptidoglycan ( PG ) cell wall . Both LPS and PG are essential cell envelope components that are synthesized independently and assembled by dedicated transenvelope multiprotein complexes . We have identified a point-mutation in the gene for O-antigen ligase ( WaaL ) in Escherichia coli that causes LPS to be modified with PG subunits , intersecting these two pathways . Synthesis of the PG-modified LPS ( LPS* ) requires ready access to the small PG precursor pool but does not weaken cell wall integrity , challenging models of precursor sequestration at PG assembly machinery . LPS* is efficiently transported to the cell surface without impairing OM function . Because LPS* contains the canonical vancomycin binding site , these surface-exposed molecules confer increased vancomycin-resistance by functioning as molecular decoys that titrate the antibiotic away from its intracellular target . This unexpected LPS glycosylation fuses two potent pathogen-associated molecular patterns ( PAMPs ) .", "plain language summary": "Tiny Gram-negative bacteria are one of humankind's deadliest foes , causing infections of wounds and the bloodstream that are very hard to treat . Many Gram-negative bacteria are resistant to several common antibiotics , and the few treatments available that can successfully kill the bacteria are often also toxic to the patients . Understanding how these bacteria elude antibiotics could help scientists develop better , less toxic treatments . Most bacteria are surrounded by a cell wall that helps protect the bacteria and gives them structure . Many broad-spectrum antibiotics , including penicillin and vancomycin , work by interfering with how this protective wall is built from molecules called peptidoglycans . However , Gram-negative bacteria have an outer membrane that prevents many antibiotics from reaching the cell wall , and so the antibiotics are unable to kill the bacteria . The outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria is made up of sugars and fatty molecules called lipids . Recently , scientists discovered a mutation that interferes with the movement of the lipid and sugar molecules that make up the outer membrane , which compromises this protective layer and makes the bacteria more susceptible to antibiotics . To learn more about how this mutation interferes with the defenses of the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli , Grabowicz et al . searched for compensating mutations that can counteract it and restore the antibiotic resistance of these mutant bacteria . The search revealed that a mutation in a gene called waaL increases E . coli's resistance to vancomycin , but not to other antibiotics . The gene encodes an enzyme , and the mutant form of the enzyme attaches some peptidoglycans to the surface of the outer membrane instead of incorporating them into the cell wall . The stray peptidoglycans on the cell's surface act as decoys , binding to vancomycin and keeping the drug from reaching its true target—the cell wall . The decoy strategy is similar to a mechanism used by Gram-positive bacteria—which lack a protective outer membrane—to resist vancomycin treatment , which also involves creating sites that bind the drug and keep it from its target . Vancomycin is not currently used clinically to treat E . coli or other Gram-negative infections because these bacteria are naturally quite resistant for other reasons . However , Grabowicz et al . 's findings do demonstrate how quickly bacteria can adapt and produce new defenses to antibiotics when old strategies fail .", "article": "1 Main text A peptidoglycan ( PG ) cell wall is an essential extracytoplasmic feature of most bacteria ( Singer et al . , 1989 ) ; this essentiality has made its biogenesis a fruitful target for antibiotics , including vancomycin and penicillin . The cell wall is directly exposed to the extracellular milieu in Gram-positive bacteria , but is shielded in Escherichia coli and other Gram-negative species by a highly selective permeability barrier formed by the outer membrane ( OM ) . The OM prevents influx of antibiotics , such as vancomycin , restricting their access to intracellular targets ( Eggert et al . , 2001; Ruiz et al . , 2005 ) . Lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) forms the surface-exposed outer leaflet of the OM and is key to the barrier function ( Osborn et al . , 1972; Kamio and Nikaido , 1976; Nikaido , 2003 ) . LPS is a glycolipid consisting of a ‘lipid A’ anchor within the bilayer , and a set of covalently attached distal ‘core’ saccharides ( Raetz and Whitfield , 2002 ) . LPS is made at the cytosolic leaflet of the inner membrane ( IM ) before being flipped to the periplasmic leaflet ( Zhou et al . , 1998 ) . A transenvelope complex of seven lipopolysaccharide transport proteins ( LptABCDEFG ) delivers LPS from the IM to the OM ( Ruiz et al . , 2009; Chng et al . , 2010a ) . A sub-complex of the β-barrel LptD and lipoprotein LptE resides within the OM and accomplishes the final step of inserting LPS into the outer leaflet ( Chng et al . , 2010b ) . A recently described lptE mutation ( lptE613 ) causes defective LPS transport and leads to increased antibiotic sensitivity ( Malojčić et al . , 2014 ) . To better understand the basis of the lptE613 defect , we isolated spontaneous suppressors that restored antibiotic resistance . One such vancomycin-resistant suppressor mapped to the waaL gene , the product of which is an IM glycosyltransferase that attaches O-antigen ( O-Ag ) oligosaccharides to LPS ( Han et al . , 2012; Ruan et al . , 2012 ) . Indeed , the suppressed strain is certainly no more vancomycin sensitive than is the corresponding wild-type control ( Figure 1A ) . However , this suppressor ( waaL15 herein ) was not specific for lptE613 or even for LPS transport defects . The waaL15 mutation increases vancomycin resistance in strains carrying bamB or bamE null mutations that disrupt the OM barrier by causing defects in β-barrel protein assembly ( Figure 1B ) ( Ricci and Silhavy , 2012 ) . Moreover , waaL15 also increases vancomycin-resistance even in the wild-type strain ( Figure 1A ) . The suppressor does not qualitatively improve the OM barrier , since it did not increase resistance against other antibiotics ( Figure 1B ) . So , waaL15 provides a vancomycin-specific resistance mechanism across different strains . 10 . 7554/eLife . 05334 . 003Figure 1 . A mutant O-antigen ligase increases vancomycin resistance . ( A ) waaL15 provides a strain-independent increase in vancomycin resistance . Isogenic strains , differing by a point mutation in waaL , were plated by serial dilution on LB agar containing indicated amounts of vancomycin . ( B ) waaL15 does not improve resistance against other antibiotics . Antibiotic discs containing either 15 μg erythromycin or 5 μg rifampin were placed on LB agar overlays inoculated with the indicated strains . Diametric zones of growth inhibition were measured across the disc . The disc diameter was 6 mm and this value represents growth at the disc . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 05334 . 003 The domesticated E . coli K-12 does not produce the normal substrate ( O-Ag ) of WaaL ( Liu and Reeves , 1994 ) and a waaL deletion does not suppress vancomycin sensitivity , indicating that waaL15 is a gain-of-function mutation . Thus , the WaaL15 mutant O-Ag ligase , which contains an F332S substitution , must have an altered activity . Silver-staining of isolated LPS confirmed that WaaL15 modifies LPS with additional sugars to produce an additional glycoform ( LPS* ) , detected as a higher molecular-weight band that is absent in waaL+ ( Figure 2A ) . WaaL can use two minor saccharide substrates to modify LPS in E . coli K-12: enterobacterial common-antigen ( ECA ) and colanic acid ( CA ) . ECA-modified LPS is a minor constituent of the OM ( Schmidt et al . , 1976; Meredith et al . , 2007 ) . Production of CA is regulated by the Rcs phospho-relay stress response system , and CA-modified LPS ( called ‘M-LPS’ ) is only detectable during severe envelope stress ( Meredith et al . , 2007 ) . Perhaps waaL15 had improved the utility of one , or both , of these substrates . However , LPS silver-staining revealed that LPS* remained detectable when we inactivated biosynthesis of ECA ( rff ) , CA ( cpsG ) , or both these polysaccharides ( rff cpsG ) ( Figure 2A ) . Moreover , if we increase the amounts of a competing substrate by introducing the rcsC137 mutation to activate expression of the genes for CA biosynthesis ( Gottesman et al . , 1985 ) , we actually observed lowered LPS* abundance at the expense of increased M-LPS ( Figure 2B ) . Notably , the decrease in LPS* correlated with a significant reduction in vancomycin-resistance , providing evidence that LPS* molecules directly mediate the resistance ( Figure 2C ) . Similarly , if O-antigen biosynthesis is restored by introducing a wild-type wbbL gene , we observe lowered LPS* at the expense of wild-type LPS and vancomycin resistance is reduced . We conclude that WaaL15 is able to use a new substrate and thereby generate a previously uncharacterized LPS glycoform that provides a specific mechanism for vancomycin resistance . 10 . 7554/eLife . 05334 . 004Figure 2 . Mutant O-antigen ligase produces a novel form of LPS that is directly responsible for vancomycin resistance . ( A ) WaaL15 uses a novel substrate to produce a new LPS glycoform . Isolated LPS was resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by silver staining . A higher molecular weight glycoform ( LPS* ) appears in waaL15 strains . Mutations that inactivate biosynthesis of ECA ( rff::Tn10-66 ) or CA ( ΔcpsG::kan ) do not abrogate LPS* production . ( B ) Overproduction of CA leads to decreased LPS* abundance . Isogenic strains were constructed to express either wt rcsC+ or the rcsC137 mutant allele that hyper-activates CA biosynthesis . LPS was isolated and visualized as in ( A ) . LPS molecules modified with a one- or two- CA repeat units are labeled M-LPS and M2-LPS , respectively . ( C ) Reduced LPS* levels correlate with reduced vancomycin resistance . Strains were plated by serial dilution onto LB agar supplemented with vancomycin . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 05334 . 004 All native WaaL substrates contain carbohydrates linked to a common undecaprenyl ( Und ) lipid carrier . PG biosynthesis involves a disaccharide pentapeptide ( DPP ) linked to the same Und carrier , a molecule called lipid II ( Figure 3A ) . To directly determine if lipid II is a substrate for WaaL15 , we treated isolated LPS* with the muralytic enzyme mutanolysin ( Figure 3A , B ) . Digestion of purified LPS* , but not LPS , liberated near-stoichiometric quantities of fragments that were identified by mass spectrometry as DPP or derivatives with a tetrapeptide stem ( Figure 3C ) . Importantly , there is no evidence for cross-linked products suggesting that lipid II was the source of the LPS* glycosylation ( Lebar et al . , 2013 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 05334 . 005Figure 3 .

( A ) The total ion chromatograms ( TIC ) of mutanolysin digested PG cell wall from waaL+ strain MG1210 , and waaL15 strains MG1211 are nearly identical . Disaccharide pentapeptide ( DPP , fragment A ) is present in mutanolysin digested LPS* but not in the PG cell wall samples . ( B ) Mass spectra and structures for reduced DPP ( fragment A ) and reduced disaccharide tetrapeptide ( fragment B ) from mutanolysin digested LPS* . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 05334 . 006 There are several carboxypeptidases in the periplasm that remove the terminal D-Alanine ( D-Ala ) from DPP to produce the tetrapeptide derivative . Indeed , E . coli PG contains negligible amounts of pentapeptide stems ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) . Figure 3C shows that about 50% of the LPS* is sequestered before it can be attacked by one of these carboxypeptidases . It seemed likely that sequestration happens because the molecule is transported from the periplasm to the cell surface . Peptide stems from adjacent peptidoglycan strands in the cell wall are cross-linked via transpeptidation between the penultimate D-Ala on one stem and a meso-diaminopimelic acid ( m-DAP ) residue on a nearby stem ( Vollmer et al . , 2008 ) . Extensive cross-linking produces a rigid macromolecular meshwork that is vital to cell wall function . Vancomycin binds and sequesters the terminal D-Ala-D-Ala residues of a pentapeptide stem in order to inhibit transpeptidation ( Perkins , 1969 ) . Since LPS* was the product of DPP ligation onto LPS , then this modified glycoform should contain vancomycin binding sites . We assessed the ability of purified LPS* to bind vancomycin in vitro . LPS* was immobilized on a carboxymethylated dextran ( CM3 ) chip and we used surface plasmon resonance to monitor interactions with differing concentrations of vancomycin . We were able to measure specific binding of vancomycin to LPS* and to obtain a Kd = 0 . 48 ± 0 . 08 µM ( Figure 4A and Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) , which is comparable to a reported Kd for vancomycin-lipid II interactions in vesicles ( Al-Kaddah et al . , 2010 ) . Clearly , LPS* molecules include high affinity binding sites for vancomycin . 10 . 7554/eLife . 05334 . 007Figure 4 . Mutant WaaL attaches peptidoglycan fragments to LPS . ( A ) LPS* specifically binds vancomycin . Purified LPS* was immobilized on a CM3 chip and varying concentrations of vancomycin were applied . Binding was measured at 25°C by surface plasmon resonance . Fitting of equilibrium signal yielded a Kd = 0 . 48 ± 0 . 08 µM . Standard deviation was measured for 0 . 6 µM and 1 . 2 µM and was ±1 RU .

( C ) , The reference subtracted kinetics after 400 s of injection . The equilibrium signals were plotted in Figure 4A . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 05334 . 008 The ability of LPS* to directly bind vancomycin suggested a possible resistance mechanism , namely that vancomycin is titrated outside the cell . To test this hypothesis , we performed live cell microscopy using a fluorescent vancomycin-BODIPY . We used a wild-type strain background with an intact OM that prevents the influx of vancomycin , to avoid labeling intracellular sites of PG synthesis . Indeed , waaL+ cells could not be fluorescently labeled ( Figure 4B ) . On the other hand , we readily detected circumferential labeling of waaL15 bacteria , confirming the presence of accessible D-Ala-D-Ala residues at the cell surface ( Figure 4B ) . Several vancomycin-resistance mechanisms exist in Gram-positive bacteria , including: alterations in peptidoglycan metabolism can produce thicker cell walls ( Cui et al . , 2003 ) ; and transpeptidation can be reduced to leave more free D-Ala-D-Ala residues within the established cell wall structure ( Sieradzki and Tomasz , 1997 ) . It was not immediately apparent to us that any of these strategies could be employed in E . coli since virtually all of the terminal D-Ala residues of DPP are removed either by cross-linking or by the carboxypeptidases . However , we show that the waaL15 mechanism is comparable since it also increases the number of free D-Ala-D-Ala targets that can tie up vancomycin . Moreover , by displaying D-Ala-D-Ala at the cell surface the waaL15 mutation titrates vancomycin away from the true drug target , in an altogether different cellular compartment . Therefore , LPS* confers resistance by acting as a molecular decoy for vancomycin . Given that Gram-negative bacteria are inherently resistant to vancomycin this decoy mechanism may not be of clinical significance . However , the increased resistance it does confer clearly demonstrates the tremendous adaptability of bacteria under antibiotic stress . The biosynthesis of LPS* is remarkable . Lipid II in E . coli is extremely scarce , its steady-state abundance is thought to be only 1000–2000 molecules per cell ( van Heijenoort et al . , 1992 ) . Insertion of new PG is thought to occur via large multiprotein morphogenic complexes: the elongasome and the divisome , responsible for PG synthesis along the lateral cell body and at the septum , respectively . In order to overcome the scarcity of lipid II and limit its diffusion away from sites of PG growth , both complexes are suggested to include at least some of the lipid II biosynthetic enzymes , and the presumed flippases that deliver lipid II from the site of synthesis in the cytoplasm to the site of cell wall assembly in the periplasm ( Szwedziak and Löwe , 2013 ) . In this model , the substrate for PG synthesis would be isolated physically from the LPS assembly pathway . LPS is inserted into the OM of each cell at a rate exceeding 70 , 000 molecules per minute ( Lima et al . , 2013 ) and we approximate that one-third of LPS is modified by WaaL15 with lipid II-sourced DPP . Clearly , WaaL15 has ready access to lipid II and this is inconsistent with a model of diffusion-limited lipid II sequestered at the elongasome or divisome complexes . Recent evidence also points to wider lipid II availability ( Lee et al . , 2014; Sham et al . , 2014 ) . Our data indicate that the re-charging of the lipid carrier with new DPP must also be extremely efficient to maintain such a robust pool of PG precursor . WaaL15 drains the available lipid II pool with no apparent detriment to cell wall integrity ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) . Lipid II limitation can be revealed by synthetic genetic interactions in a strain lacking the elongasome ( Paradis-Bleau et al . , 2014 ) , but it is not the recharging of lipid II that is limiting , rather it is the biosynthesis of DPP ( Supplementary file 1A ) . In many bacteria , LPS is decorated with highly variable O-Ags that are linear polymers of repeating units of 3–6 monosaccharides ( Kalynych et al . , 2014 ) . In E . coli the multitude of different O-Ags initiate with GlcNAc , ECA also initiates with GlcNAc . In E . coli K-12 when colonic acid is overproduced M-LPS is made from an intitating Glc residue . The F332S mutation broadens substrate specificity of the WaaL glycosyltransferase allowing it to efficiently accept a significantly more bulky initiating MurNAc with an attached oligopeptide stem . The only other glycosyltransferase that is known to use lipid II as a substrate is PglL from Neisseria and the use required overproduction of the enzyme in E . coli ( Faridmoayer et al . , 2008 ) . It is also remarkable that we detect no OM biogenesis defect in strains carrying waaL15 , demonstrating that the Lpt system is fully competent for the transport and assembly of LPS* despite the addition of both unnatural sugars and peptide stems . Both LPS and PG are pathogen-associated molecular patterns ( PAMPs ) that potently activate innate immune responses via distinct pathways , and it seems sensible for Gram-negative bacteria to keep these entities separated . We suggest that the F332S substitution has inactivated an exclusion mechanism that prevents WaaL from utilizing the lipid II pool . 2 Materials and methods Strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Supplementary file 1B and Supplementary file 1C , respectively . Strains were grown in lysogeny broth ( LB , 10 g/L NaCl ) or M63 minimal medium under aeration at 37°C unless otherwise noted . When appropriate , media were supplemented with kanamycin ( Kan , 25 μg/ml ) , ampicillin ( Amp , 25–125 μg/ml ) , tetracycline ( Tet , 20 μg/ml ) , chloramphenicol ( Cam , 20 μg/ml ) , vancomycin ( Vanc , 65–260 μg/ml ) and arabinose ( Ara , 0 . 2% vol/vol ) . Kanamycin deletion-insertion mutations of bamE , cpsG , mrcA , mrcB , lpoA and lpoB were obtained from the Keio collection ( Baba et al . , 2006 ) . ECA null rff::Tn10-66 allele was obtained from strain 21566 ( Meier-Dieter et al . , 1990 ) . The ompC::Tn5 rcsC137 was obtained from strain SG20803 ( Brill et al . , 1988 ) . Mutant alleles were introduced by P1vir transduction . Spontaneous suppressor mutants of strain MG1029 capable of growing on LB plates supplemented with vancomycin ( 140 μg/ml ) were isolated; one such mutant strain was MG1088 . The mutation locus conferring vancomycin-resistance in MG1088 was identified by linkage mapping using a library of random mini-Tn10 insertions ( Kleckner et al . , 1991 ) . In this way , the tdh::Tn10 allele was found to be approximately 70% linked to the suppressor mutation waaL15 . The F332S mutation was then identified by PCR amplification and sequencing of the waaL locus . The waaL15 mutation was moved into the NR754 wild-type strain by linkage with tdh::Tn10 . In order to generate the unmarked waaL15 strain ( MG1643 ) and its wild-type control ( MG1642 ) , the tdh::Tn10 mutation was removed from strains MG1210 and MG1211 by first introducing a linked ΔcysE::kan mutation ( Baba et al . , 2006 ) , selecting for KanR and screening for TetS transductants that were VancR ( waaL15 ) or VancS ( waaL+ ) . The ΔcysE::kan mutation was then replaced with cysE+ by transduction , selection on M63 minimal medium , and screening of VancR/VancS . In E . coli , two key PG synthases , PBP1A ( mrcA/ponA ) and PBP1B ( mrcB/ponB ) , incorporate DPP from Lipid II into PG strands and also mediate transpeptidation ( Paradis-Bleau et al . , 2010; Typas et al . , 2010 ) . Recent evidence suggests that lipid II limitation can be revealed by synthetic genetic interactions in a strain lacking mrcB ( Paradis-Bleau et al . , 2014 ) . The genetic interaction of PG synthase mutants with waaL15 was assessed as follows . KanR-marked null alleles of lpoA , lpoB , mrcA and mrcB were introduced by P1vir transduction into CAG strains that carry a Tn10 insertion in a nearby locus ( see Supplementary file 1A ) . KanR TetR transductants were isolated and used to generate P1vir lysates . These P1vir were used to transduce waaL+ ( MG1642 ) or waaL15 ( MG1643 ) strains , selecting for the Tn10 marker . The frequency with which the KanR-marked lpo and mrc alleles were co-transduced ( genetically linked ) was determined by replica plating on LB+Kan . Linkage was assessed in a total of 300 transductants from three independent experiments . A decrease in the cotransduction frequency in waaL15 strains relative to waaL+ indicates a synthetic interaction between waaL15 and the KanR-marked allele . The synthetic interaction between waaL15 and mrcB/lpoB null alleles was relieved in strains carrying pMurA when expression of the cloned murA gene ( encoding the enzyme responsible for the first committed step in DPP biosynthesis ) was induced with 100 μM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) . Overexpression of murA increases the cellular pool of UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide and consequently also increases the pool of lipid II . A total to 1 × 109 cells from liquid culture were taken , pelleted and resuspended 0 . 05 ml of ‘LPS Sample Buffer’ ( 0 . 66 M Tris pH 7 . 6 , 2% vol/vol sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS] , 10% vol/vol glycerol , 4% vol/vol β-mercaptoethanol , 0 . 1% wt/vol bromophenol blue ) . Samples were boiled for 10 min and allowed to cool to room temperature . 10 μl of Proteinase K ( 2 . 5 mg/ml , in LPS Sample Buffer ) was added and samples were incubated at 56°C for 16 hr . LPS samples were then resolved by SDS-PAGE and silver stained as described previously ( Tsai and Frasch , 1981 ) . By quantifying band density using ImageJ , we measured that LPS* constitutes 29 ± 1% of the total LPS in waaL15 samples . 3 ml of molten LB Top agar ( 0 . 75% agar ) was inoculated with 0 . 1 ml of overnight culture . The mixture was poured onto a LB agar plate ( 1 . 5% agar , ) and allowed to set . Antibiotic discs ( BD Sensi-Disc ) were placed on the Top agar overlay and plates were incubated overnight at 37°C . The ‘zone of growth inhibition’ was measured across the antibiotic disc . Overnight cultures were sub-cultured at 1:100 into fresh LB broth and grown for 1 . 5 hr . A 1 ml aliquot was taken , pelleted and was twice washed with 1 ml M63 medium . Cells were resuspended in 0 . 1 ml of M63 broth containing 1 μg/ml of vancomycin-BODIPY-FL ( Life Technologies , V-34850 ) . Cells were incubated at room temperature for 10 min and then washed twice with 1 ml M63 broth . Cells were then resuspended in 0 . 03 ml of M63 broth , and approximately 2 ml was spotted onto an M63-agarose pad . Cells were immediately visualized on a Nikon Eclipse 90i microscope with a Nikon Plan Apo 1 . 4/100 × Oil Ph3 phase objective . E . coli MG1210 and MG1211 were each grown in 4 × 1 . 5 l LB medium shaking at 37°C overnight to stationary phase . The cells were harvested by centrifugation for 15 min at 5000×g , 4°C and washed with water ( 700 ml ) and ethanol ( 40 ml ) once , then twice with acetone ( 40 ml ) . After drying the cell pellet in a desiccator over night in vacuo , PCP ( Phenol-Chloroform-petroleum ether ) method was used for rough LPS extraction ( Galanos et al . , 1969 ) . E . coli MG1210 and MG1211 were each grown in 500 ml LB medium shaking at 37°C to stationary phase ( 6 hr ) . The cell wall was isolated from the culture as described by Glauner et al . ( 1988 ) and Uehara et al . ( 2009 ) , with modifications described below . The cells were resuspended in 20 ml phosphate buffered saline ( PB , pH = 7 . 4 ) and boiled for 30 min in 80 ml 5% SDS . After the samples cooled , they were pelleted ( 14 , 000 rpm , 25°C , 1 hr ) and washed six times by pelleting ( 14 , 000 rpm , 25°C , 1 hr ) from 50 ml water aliquots to remove the SDS . The samples were resuspended in 1 ml PBS , treated with α-amidase ( 100 µl , 2 mg/ml stock in 50% glycerol , Sigma A-6380 ) and incubated at 37°C with shaking for 2 hr . To cleave proteins attached to the cell wall , α-chymotrypsin ( 100 µl , 3 mg/ml in 50% glycerol , Sigma C3142 ) was added , and the samples were incubated at 37°C with shaking overnight . An additional aliquot of α-chymotrypsin ( 100 µl ) was added , and the samples were digested for an additional 4 hr . To remove the proteins , SDS was added to a final concentration of 1% , and the samples were incubated at 95°C for 1 hr . After cooling , the samples were again pelleted ( 14 , 000 rpm , 25°C , 1 hr ) and washed with water repeatedly ( 4 × 25 ml ) to remove the SDS . The final peptidoglycan ( PG ) samples were resuspended in 500 µl 0 . 02% azide and stored at 4°C . The PG composition was analyzed by LC/MS as previously described ( Lebar et al . , 2013 ) . The method was also used to analyze LPS samples . The glycosylhydrolase mutanolysin liberated DPP and disaccharide tetrapeptide from LPS* . Aliquots ( 40 µl ) of PG ( from MG1210 and MG1211 ) and LPS ( from MG1210 and MG1211 ) were incubated with mutanolysin ( 10 U , 2 . 5 µl , 4000 U/ml , Sigma M9901 , stored at −20°C in 50 mM TES , pH 7 . 0 , 1 mM MgCl2 , 10% glycerol ) in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer ( pH 6 . 0 , 100 μl total volume ) at 37°C with shaking overnight . Another aliquot of mutanolysin ( 10 U , 2 . 5 µl ) was added , and the mixture was incubated at 37°C with shaking for 3 hr . Insoluble particles were separated by centrifugation ( 16 , 000×g ) . The supernatant , containing soluble fragments , was treated with sodium borohydride ( 10 mg/ml in water , 100 μl ) at room temperature for 30 min . Phosphoric acid ( 20% , 12 μl ) was then added to adjust pH to ∼4 . When bubbling ceased , the samples were lyophilized and re-dissolved in 25 μl water , which was analyzed on LC/MS . LC/MS analysis was conducted with ESI-MS operating in positive mode . The instrument was equipped with a Waters Symmetry Shield RP18 column ( 5 μm , 3 . 9 × 150 mm ) with matching column guard . The fragments were separated using the following method: 0 . 5 ml/min H2O ( 0 . 1% formic acid ) for 5 min followed by a gradient of 0% ACN ( 0 . 1% formic acid ) /H2O ( 0 . 1% formic acid ) to 20% ACN ( 0 . 1% formic acid ) /H2O ( 0 . 1% formic acid ) over 40 min . Purified LPS ( 0 . 5 mg/ml ) from strains MG1210 or MG1211 were extruded in 20 mM Tris/HCl pH 8 , 150 mM NaCl and immobilized on poly-L-lysine coated CM3 Biacore chips on the active and reference channel , respectively ( Malojčić et al . , 2014 ) . All experiments were performed using a Biacore X100 instrument at 25°C at a flow rate of 10 μl/min with 20 mM Tris/HCl pH 8 , 150 mM NaCl buffer . Different concentrations of vancomycin were injected for 400 s and dissociation was recorded for another 500 s to return to baseline . No binding was observed to the reference channel . The equilibrium signal in the difference channel was fitted to f = Bmax*abs ( x ) / ( Kd + abs ( x ) ) with R2 = 0 . 88 . Standard deviation was measured for 0 . 6 µM and 1 . 2 µM vancomycin in triplicate and did not exceed 1 RU ."}

As part of the release process , these molecules are packaged into small , balloon-like structures called vesicles . Such vesicles move around within cells and are able to find the right place to release their contents to the outside . A cellular compartment called the Golgi complex helps to prepare proteins for release from the cell . Vesicles can bind to tethering proteins on the surface of the Golgi , but it was not clear how these proteins are able to capture the correct kind of vesicle . The prediction was that the proteins are rigid , shaped like pipe cleaners that stick out from the Golgi as a meshwork that traps vesicles . Cheung et al . isolated a specific Golgi tethering protein ( called GCC185 ) from cultured human cells and used a technique called atomic force microscopy to visualize its structure . This revealed that this protein is not rod-like; it is instead rather floppy , and has two arms at one end that may ‘hug’ the incoming vesicle . Cheung et al . showed that this protein needs its middle portion to be floppy to work correctly . This changes the way we think about how vesicles are able to find their corresponding targets on different compartments inside cells . Further experiments are now needed to answer a number of questions . What does the tether look like when actually bound to a vesicle ? What happens after the vesicle binds – how does the tether let go ? What other components are needed for vesicle capture and release ?", "article": "1 Introduction Membrane trafficking involves the collection of cargo into transport vesicles , movement of vesicles along cytoskeletal tracks , and tethering , docking and fusion of vesicles at their target membranes . Tethering is the process by which partner membranes are brought together into close proximity to permit their subsequent fusion ( Pfeffer , 1999; Sztul and Lupashin , 2006; Yu and Hughson , 2010 ) . Two classes of transport vesicle tethers have been described to date: multi-subunit complexes such as the Exocyst , COG , Dsl1 and TRAPP complexes ( Bröcker et al . , 2010 ) , and larger , dimeric coiled-coil containing proteins such as p115 and EEA1 ( Sztul and Lupashin , 2006; Munro , 2011 ) . Both classes share the ability to bind to Rab GTPases , SNARE proteins and vesicle coat complexes , suggesting that they play important roles in coordinating molecular events important for target recognition and membrane fusion ( Short et al . , 2005; Cai et al . , 2007; Sinka et al . , 2008; Hayes et al . , 2009; Hughson and Reinisch , 2010 ) . Golgins are long , Golgi-associated proteins that contain a high proportion of sequences that are predicted to form coiled coils ( Munro , 2011; Short et al . , 2005 ) . They are anchored to the Golgi via their C-termini , and models suggest that they protrude long distances , relying on the relative rigidity of the coiled coil structure to provide a meshwork that can capture vesicles in the vicinity of the Golgi ( Yu and Hughson , 2010; Munro , 2011 ) . GCC185 is a Golgin required for the transport of mannose 6-phosphate receptors ( MPRs ) from late endosomes to the trans Golgi network ( Reddy , 2006; Derby et al . , 2007 ) . Cells depleted of GCC185 accumulate MPRs in Rab9 GTPase- and AP-1-decorated transport carriers ( Hayes et al . , 2009; Reddy , 2006; Brown et al . , 2011 ) , providing an assay for GCC185 tethering capacity . GCC185 is likely anchored on the TGN surface by cooperative binding of its C-terminus to both Rab6 and Arl1 GTPases ( Burguete et al . , 2008 ) . We ( Reddy , 2006; Burguete et al . , 2008 ) and others ( Derby , 2004 ) have shown that GCC185 binds Arl1 rather weakly , but Rab6A binding greatly enhances Arl1 interaction ( Burguete et al . , 2008 ) . Arl1’s role in anchoring GCC185 was questioned because it seemed not to be required if siRNA-depleted by 80% ( Houghton et al . , 2009 ) ; in fact , 90% depletion of Arl1 is required to displace GCC185 from membranes and to detect its role in Golgi localization of the GCC185 C-terminus ( Burguete et al . , 2008 ) . To date , we have little ( if any ) information , whether Golgins are actually as long as predicted , whether they are relatively rigid , or even where or how they bind transport vesicles . Moreover , once they bind vesicles , what happens next ? Many coiled-coil tethers contain putative hinges , located between predicted rod-like , coiled-coil domains ( Barr and Short , 2003; Cai et al . , 2007; Lupas et al . , 1991; Munro , 2011; Pfeffer , 1999 ) . Do these regions function as hinges ? We have taken a multidisciplinary approach to investigate the mechanism of vesicle tethering by a trans Golgi network ( TGN ) -associated Golgin , GCC185 . Our data provide novel insight into the tethering process and suggest that the TGN Golgin , GCC185 , uses an unexpected mechanism to accomplish vesicle tethering . 2 Results Current models posit that a tethering protein should capture vesicles at one end and be anchored to the target membrane at the other end . For GCC185 , the N-terminus would therefore be predicted to bind vesicles . We used differential centrifugation to isolate a crude vesicle fraction carrying the cargoes , GFP-Rab9 ( Figure 7B ) and endogenous cation-independent MPR ( CI-MPR; Figure 7C ) and Rab9 ( Figure 7D ) proteins . We then compared the ability of GCC185 N-terminal residues 1-358 or ( similarly sized ) internal residues 1032–1331 ( Figure 7A ) to bind these vesicles after immobilization on glutathione-Sepharose . Figures 7B-D show that vesicles were indeed captured by the N-terminal 1–358 fragment but not by the internal fragment of similar length . Interestingly , the 1–358 sequences tethered most effectively when the obligate GST dimer was located at the fragment’s C-terminus ( 1–358-GST ) rather than the N-terminus ( GST-1–358; Figure 7C ) . Specificity control experiments showed that neither early endosome ( EEA1 ) nor endoplasmic reticulum ( calnexin ) markers were captured by the constructs tested ( Figure 7C ) . N-terminal sequences are essential for GCC185 function in cells ( Hayes et al . , 2009 ) , consistent with their ability to bind transport vesicles in vitro . 10 . 7554/eLife . 12790 . 013Figure 7 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 12790 . 013 The functional significance of N-terminal splaying detected in 80% of purified GCC185 molecules ( Figure 2 , 3 ) is confirmed by the finding that the fragment capable of splaying at the N-terminus ( 1–358-GST ) showed highest tethering activity ( Figure 7C , D ) . Although we cannot rule out completely , the possibility of GST-steric hindrance for vesicle binding when present at the N-terminus , these data suggest that free N-termini represent both the active and most abundant form of this tethering protein . These experiments show that GCC185 N-terminal sequences can bind cargo—essential for a bona fide tethering protein . Moreover , this represents the first direct demonstration of in vitro vesicle tethering by a TGN localized , GRIP-domain containing tethering protein . 3 Discussion We have shown , for the first time , that flexibility in a tethering protein is required for its functionality in cells , both in supporting the receipt of transport vesicles at the Golgi and maintaining Golgi ribbon structure . We have shown that transport vesicles can bind to GCC185’s N-terminus , and seem to prefer to bind to splayed ends of this dimeric , coiled coil tether . The presence of multiple Rab-binding sites along the length of individual Golgin proteins ( Sinka et al . , 2008; Hayes et al . , 2009; Short et al . , 2001 ) has led others to suggest that vesicles may hop along individual tethers ( Barr and Short , 2003 ) or be captured by Golgin ‘tentacles’ within a potential Golgin meshwork towards the target membrane ( Munro , 2011 ) . Such a model considers tethers as rigid , extended rods ( Figure 8 , left ) . Our data favor a model whereby GCC185 is C-terminally anchored to the TGN through Rab6 and Arl1 GTPases ( Burguete et al . , 2008 ) and captures Rab9-decorated transport vesicles ( Hayes et al . , 2009; Reddy , 2006 ) by binding them at the N-terminus and/or near the hinge region ( Brown et al . , 2011 ) ; importantly , the central bubble gives significant flexibility to the protein and would allow it to collapse onto the Golgi surface , bringing vesicles close to the trans Golgi target membrane ( Figure 8 ) . GCC185 can bind multiple Rab GTPases along its length ( Hayes et al . , 2009 ) , as well as syntaxin16 , Arl1 and Arl4 GTPases ( Burguete et al . , 2008; Ganley et al . , 2008; Lin et al . , 2011 ) . GCC185 also binds to CLASP proteins that catalyze microtubule polymerization from the Golgi surface ( Efimov et al . , 2007 ) . These additional interactions will all pull the tether towards the Golgi surface , bringing N-terminally bound vesicles closer to the Golgi surface for productive vesicle docking . 10 . 7554/eLife . 12790 . 014Figure 8 . Collapse model for vesicle tethering at the TGN . Previous models based on GMAP-210 have led to a model that tethers extend from the Golgi as highly rigid rods that may bend in the middle ( 'Rigid hinge' ) . Data presented here show that GCC185 is shorter than originally predicted ( 145 nm vs . >204 nm ) , has splayed ends that can capture vesicles , and an unusual central bubble and floppiness as detected by atomic force microscopy . These features lead us to propose a flexible collapse model whereby the tether may collapse onto the Golgi surface , possibly facilitated by Rab GTPases and other proteins that are localized there . Note that vesicles may also ( or alternately ) bind near the bubble , and engage both the AP1 and Rab9 binding sites there , in addition to GCC185’s N-terminal arms . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 12790 . 014 We have shown here that the functionally essential , GCC185 N-terminus has the capacity to bind to transport vesicles in vitro . N-terminal vesicle binding is shared with GMAP-210 , a Golgin localized to the cis-Golgi ( Sato et al . , 2015 ) ; for other Golgins , it is presumed due to binding sites for various coat proteins . In previous work ( Brown et al . , 2011 ) , we showed that GCC185 residues 938–1032 comprise an AP-1 binding site that is also needed for GCC185 vesicle tethering ( blue bar in Figure 1A ) ; the transport vesicles are AP-1 decorated , thus this was presumed to represent a possible vesicle binding site . This AP-1 binding site is located immediately downstream of the regions deleted in the △hinge protein studied here ( 751-805 , 890939 ) ( Figure 1A ) . Moreover , an apparently dispensible , Rab9 GTPase binding site is located directly between the two deletions made to generate the △hinge mutant ( orange bar , Figure 1A ) . Binding of Rab9 to that site could influence the ability of that part of the protein to form a bubble , and could influence the efficiency of tethering on a time scale finer than that assayed here and previously . Both Rab9 and AP-1 are present on the transport vesicles captured , but we do not yet know the precise molecular interaction underlying the ability of the N-terminal domain to bind vesicles . That a splayed N-terminus is utilized suggests that the tether gains efficiency by avidity , and can reach out to 'hug' the vesicle . How the various binding sites along GCC185 coordinate interactions with the vesicle and the target membrane to accomplish vesicle tethering represents an important area for future work . Given the presence of AP-1 and Rab9 binding sites adjacent to the central bubble ( Figure 1A ) and the additional capacity of the splayed N-terminus to capture transport vesicles , it is also possible that rather than being held near GCC185’s N-terminus , the vesicle could bind primarily near the bubble while still being enwrapped by the N-terminal arms . The model in Figure 8 is drawn to scale and assumes that the transport vesicles are ~50 nm in diameter ( Barbero , 2002 ) ; they need not be larger to be able to occupy both potential vesicle binding domains . The AP-1 binding site ( 939–1 , 031 ) is essential for GCC185’s role in vesicle tethering but not Golgi ribbon maintenance ( Brown et al . , 2011 ) , and must be considered in any model of GCC185 vesicle tethering . Like GCC185 , the other human GRIP domain Golgins are also predicted to contain a high proportion of coiled coil sequences . Golgin-245 shares with GCC185 two very obvious breaks in the coiled coil that may also form a central bubble; its absolute N-terminus is also likely splayed . The shorter Golgin-97 and GCC88 proteins are likely about half as long as GCC185 by sequence alone; Golgin-97’s N-terminus is likely splayed , and GCC88 may very well also contain a central bubble . Finally , a domain between GCC185 residues 1332 and 1438 is required for maintenance of Golgi ribbon structure but not transport vesicle tethering ( Brown et al . , 2011 ) . This observation highlights the fact that workers in this field have oversimplified thinking about how tethers function—simple engagement of N- and C-termini is not sufficient for both vesicle capture and Golgi ribbon stabilization . A recent paper studying Golgi tethers ( Wong and Munro , 2014 ) concluded that unlike other TGN tethers , GCC185 could not tether vesicles upon re-localization to mitochondria . The extent of Golgi membrane mobilization seen in that study was far greater than the small pool size of the much rarer , Rab9-containing , AP-1 positive , mannose phosphate receptor transport vesicle intermediates—that are only visualized in cells upon depletion of tethering factors ( Reddy , 2006; Brown et al . , 2011 ) . It is very possible that that study assayed the ability of TGN tethers to recruit/assemble TGN ribbons , rather than capture rare transport vesicle intermediates . Since ribbon assembly and transport vesicle capture are driven by separate domains of GCC185 , perhaps GCC185 is more potent in vesicle tethering rather than Golgi ribbon assembly . A remaining mystery is why depletion of any one of the GRIP domain-containing Golgins leads to Golgi fragmentation . Whatever the explanation , the floppy appearance of purified GCC185 , when deposited on mica in the absence of fixative , and the proximity of GCC185’s N- and C-termini on the Golgi in cells , argue strongly against this protein behaving like a pipe cleaner , protruding on the surface of the trans Golgi network in cells . Instead , tether collapse represents an appealing , alternative model . 4 Materials and methods cDNAs encoding GCC185 full-length and fragments were prepared by ligating the full-length sequence and sequence encoding residues 1–358 , 394–751 , 1–889 , 890–1684 into EGFP-C1 with a FLAG tag ( DYKDDDDK ) inserted downstream of GFP flanked by the GGATCC linker ( AS ) for purification purposes . The hinge mutant constructs were prepared by introducing GAGCTC ( EL ) at residue 751 and 805 , and CTCGAG ( LE ) at 890 and 939 to remove the original sequence . Sequential digestion with SacI and XhoI restriction enzymes ( New England Biolabs , Ipswich , MA ) followed by re-ligation of the plasmid or ligating GGS repeats to the cleaved site created the △hinge ( 1–750-EL-806-889-LE-940-1684 ) and ( GSS ) n hinge constructs ( 1–750-EL- ( GSS ) 13-EL-806-889-LE- ( GSS ) 11-LE-940–1684 ) , respectively . The HA-fusion construct was prepared by inserting the HA tag sequence ( YPYDVPDYA ) at residue 805 flanked by linker nucleotide sequence GAGCTC ( EL ) using the same strategy ( 1–804-EL- YPYDVPDYA-EL-807–1684 ) . cDNAs encoding rescue plasmids were prepared with 8 silent mutations in the siRNA-targeted region and ligated into pcDNA3 . 1 ( + ) ( Invitrogen , Grand Island , NY ) modified with an N-terminal Myc tag as described ( Hayes et al . , 2009 ) . Bacterial expression plasmids were prepared by ligating PCR products encoding residues 1–358 or 1032–1331 into pGEX4T-1 ( GE Healthcare , Pittsburgh , PA ) ( GST-1–358 , GST-1032-1331 ) or using the pQE60 vector ( Qiagen , Hilden , Germany ) with a 6X His tag upstream and a GST tag downstream of residues 1–358 ( His-1–358-GST ) . Residues 1342–1684 were inserted into the 6X-His fusion vector pET28a ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) . HeLa cells and HEK293T cells were cultured at 37°C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium ( GIBCO , Life Technologies , Grand Island , NY ) supplemented with 7 . 5% fetal bovine serum , 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin . Transfection with siRNA and rescue plasmids was performed as described ( Brown et al . , 2011 ) . In brief , cells were transfected with GCC185 siRNA targeting the sequence 5′-GGAGTTGGAA CAATCACAT-3′ using Oligofectamine ( Invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer . For rescue experiments , depletion was for 72 hr; Myc -tagged rescue constructs resistant to the siRNA were transfected 24 hr after initial siRNA treatment using FuGENE6 ( Roche , Indianapolis , IN ) . For GFP-Rab9 membrane tethering assay , GCC185-depleted 293T cells grown to 50% confluency were transfected with GFP-Rab9 construct construct using polyethylenimine ( Polysciences Inc . , Warrington , PA ) for 24 hr before the extraction of membranes . Endogenous vesicle tethering assays were preformed with non-depleted 293T cells grown to 80–90% confluency . For proximity ligation assays , HeLa cells grown to 50% confluency were transfected with GFP-fusion constructs for 24 hr before fixation . Cell fixation , staining and mounting in Mowiol were performed as described ( Hayes et al . , 2009 ) . In brief , cells were split onto 22 x 22-mm coverslips in a 6-well plate 48 hr before fixation . Cells were washed twice in PBS and fixed for 20 min in 3 . 7% formaldehyde in 200 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 4 . Fixed cells were then washed twice in PBS and permeabilized for 5 min with 0 . 2% Triton X-100 in PBS followed by two washes with PBS and a 15-min blocking with 1% BSA in PBS . Monoclonal mouse anti-cation-independent MPR antibody ( 2G11; Lombardi et al . , 1993 ) and chicken anti-Myc ( 1:1000 , Bethyl Laboratories , Inc . , Montgomery , TX ) primary antibodies , and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse ( 1:2000 ) and Alexa Fluor 555 goat anti-chicken ( 1:2000 ) secondary antibodies ( Invitrogen ) were used . Micrographs were acquired as previously described ( Brown et al . , 2011 ) . In brief , images were acquired using a microscope ( Eclipse 80i; Nikon , Tokyo , Japan ) fitted with a 60x/NA 1 . 4 plan apochromat objective lens , a Sedat Quad filter set ( Chroma Technology Corp . , Bellows Falls , VT ) and a charge-coupled device camera ( CoolSnapHQ; Photometrics , Tucson , AZ ) at room temperature . Wavelength selection was performed using a controller ( Lambda 10–3; Sutter Instrument , Novato , CA ) . Z sections were acquired with a Z axis drive ( MFC-2000; Applied Scientific Instrumentation , Eugene , OR ) at 0 . 2-mm steps . All instrumentation was controlled by MetaMorph imaging software ( Molecular Devices , Sunnyvale , CA ) . Image deconvolution was performed using a theoretical point spread function with softWoRx ( v . 4 . 1 . 0; Applied Precision Inc . , Issaquah , WA ) . The deconvolution micrographs displayed in Figure 5 represent projections of three to five central slices of the z stack acquired . Two individuals used blinded datasets to score rescue experiment images . The Duolink in situ proximity ligation assay ( PLA , Olink Bioscience , Uppsala , Sweden ) was performed according to the manufacturer . Briefly , HeLa cells transfected with GFP-GCC185 or GFP-GCC185-△hinge were washed , fixed and blocked . Rabbit anti-GCC185 C-terminus ( 1:500 , Reddy , 2006 ) , mouse anti-GCC185-1-358 N-terminus ( 1:500 ) , mouse anti-GM130 ( 1:500; BD Biosciences , San Jose , CA ) , mouse anti-Golgin 245 ( 1:500; BD Bioscience ) and mouse anti-GFP ( clones 7 . 1 and 13 . 1; 1:100; Roche ) primary antibodies were used . After 1 hr primary antibody incubation at room temperature , the PLA probe anti-mouse Plus and anti-rabbit Minus were diluted in PBS containing 1% BSA and added to cells for 1 hr at 37°C in a humidified chamber . All subsequent steps were performed at 37°C in a humidified chamber . Cells were then incubated with oligonucleotides complementary to the proximity probe and T4 DNA ligase for 30 min . Rolling-circle amplification was initiated by addition of Phi29 DNA polymerase and Texas red-labeled nucleotide probe . After 100 min , cells were washed and mounted and imaged using an Axiophot2 epifluorescence microscope fitted with a Plan-Neofluar 40x/0 . 75 objective ( Carl Zeiss MicroImaging , Thornwood , NY ) , and a digital CCD camera ORCA-R2 C10600 ( Hamamatsu , Hamamatsu City , Japan ) . All microscope instrumentation was controlled by AxioVision4 . 7 . 2 software ( Carl Zeiss MicroImaging ) . Individual cells ( objects ) were identified , and proximity ligation and GFP signals were quantified using CellProfiler ( Broad Institute , Cambridge , MA; www . cellprofiler . org ) . Expression and purification of GST-tagged constructs were as described ( Brown et al . , 2011 ) . Constructs were transformed into BL21 ( DE3 ) RIPL competent cells and bacterial cultures were induced at OD600 = 0 . 5-0 . 7 with 0 . 25 mM IPTG for 3 hr at 30°C . Cells were resuspended in 50 mM Hepes , pH7 . 4 , 250 mM NaCl , 10% ( v/v ) glycerol and protease inhibitors and lysed by two passes through an EmulsiFlex-C5 apparatus ( Avestin , Ottawa , ON ) at >10 , 000 lb/in2 followed by centrifugation at 13 , 000 rpm for 30 min in a FiberLite F15 ( 8x50c ) rotor ( Thermo Scientific ) . Clarified lysates containing GST-tagged proteins ( His-1-358-GST , GST-1-358 and GST-1032-1331 ) were incubated with glutathione Sepharose resin ( GE Healthcare ) for 1 hr at 4°C . Bound GST fusion proteins were eluted in buffer containing 20 mM glutathione . GST-1-358 and GST-1032-1331 were loaded onto PD MiniTrap G-25 ( GE Healthcare ) to remove glutathione . His-1-358-GST protein was further incubated with Ni-NTA agarose ( Qiagen ) for 2 hr at 4°C in buffer containing 20 mM imidazole and eluted with 300 mM imidazole after 3 washes . Same amount of purified His-1–358-GST , GST-1–358 and GST-1032–1331 were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose resin ( 3–5 mg protein/ml resin ) in 50 mM Hepes pH7 . 4 , 200 mM NaCl , 0 . 5 mM DTT and 10% glycerol . Resins were washed and equilibrated in 50 mM Hepes pH7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl , 5mM MgCl2 , 0 . 5 mM DTT and 50 µM GTP for subsequent membrane capturing assays . His-tagged 1342–1684 was incubated with His-Pur Ni-NTA resin ( Thermo Scientific ) for 2 hr at 4°C and eluted with buffer containing 200 mM imidazole after 3 washes . Eluted protein was further purified by gel filtration on Superdex 75 ( GE Healthcare ) in 50 mM Tris , pH7 . 4 250 mM NaCl and 10% ( v/v ) glycerol . GFP-FLAG-GCC185 constructs for AFM were produced by transfection of HEK293F mammalian suspension cells grown in FreeStyle 293 expression medium ( GIBCO , Life Technologies ) with the indicated constructs for 22 hr . Cells were lysed in 50 mM Tris , pH 7 . 4 , 250 mM NaCl , 0 . 5% Triton X-100 , 10% glycerol , 1 mM EDTA , 5 mM sodium orthovanadate and protease inhibitors . Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13 , 000 rpm for 30 min in a FiberLite F15 ( 8x50c ) rotor ( Thermo Scientific , Waltham , MA ) . Supernatants were incubated with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel ( Sigma Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) for 4 hr at 4°C , followed by washes with buffer containing 1 M NaCl and two final washes in 50 mM Tris , pH7 . 4 , 250 mM NaCl and 10% glycerol . Bound proteins were eluted with 0 . 1 mg/ml 3X FLAG peptide ( Sigma-Aldrich ) . Eluted proteins were further purified on a Sepharose 4B ( Sigma-Aldrich ) column . Anti-HA antibody labeling of the 805-HA construct was performed after FLAG peptide elution ( Sigma-Aldrich ) . Excess anti-HA antibody ( Abcam , Cambridge , MA ) was added at 4°C for >2 hr . Excess antibodies were removed using Sepharose 4B . At least three transfected 10-cm dishes ( 80–90% confluency ) were harvested for vesicle isolation . Cells were washed with PBS and incubated in hypotonic buffer ( 10 mM Hepes pH7 . 4 ) for 10 min , scraped immediately into resuspension buffer ( 10 mM Hepes , pH7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM MgCl2 + protease inhibitors ) and further lysed by passage through a 25-G needle . Lysed cells were spun at 800 g for 5 min at 4°C to remove nuclei and cell debris . The supernatant was spun at 135 , 000 g for 15 min at 4°C in TLA100 . 2 rotor . The membrane pellet was resuspended in 50 mM Hepes pH7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM MgCl2 , 0 . 5 mM DTT and 50 μM GTP . The crude suspension was further spun at 8 , 000 g for 5 min at 4°C to pellet large membranes; the supernatant was used as a crude vesicle fraction . Fifteen microliters GST-tagged protein-bound glutathione Sepharose resin was incubated with 100 μl of crude vesicle membranes ( 5–20 μg of GFP-Rab9-transfected cell or 50 μg non-transfected cell membrane ) for 45 min at room temperature with rotation . Samples were washed with 100 column volumes of buffer and eluted with buffer containing 20 mM glutathione or sample buffer without reducing agent for CI-MPR immunoblot detection . Captured components were detected by immunoblotting with chicken anti-GFP ( 1:1000 , Life Technologies ) , rabbit anti-CI-MPR ( 1:1000 ) mouse anti-EEA1 ( 1:1000 , BD Biosciences ) , goat anti-Calnexin ( C-20 , 1:1000 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Dallas , TX ) and the corresponding horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) -conjugated secondary antibodies: rabbit anti-chicken HRP ( 1:1500 , Promega , Madison , WI ) , goat anti-rabbit HRP ( 1:3000 , BioRad , Hercules , CA ) , goat anti-mouse HRP ( 1:2000 , BioRad ) and fluorescently-labeled bovine anti-goat DyLight 649 ( 1:2000 , Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories , West Grove , PA ) . HRP antibodies were detected using ECL plus ( ThermoFisher ) in conjunction with film and Versadoc . For immobilization , 25 μl purified sample ( ~1 nM ) in 50 mM Tris , pH 7 . 4 , 200 mM NaCl , 5 mM MgCl2 , 0 . 5 mM DTT and 10% glycerol was directly placed onto freshly cleaved mica . After 8 minutes , the mica surface was gently rinsed with 2 ml buffer followed by 2 ml of ddH20 to remove unbound proteins and dried by soft argon flow . Imaging was done in air with a Park100 AFM ( Park Systems , Santa Clara , CA ) operated in non-contact mode . We used ultra-sharp diamond-like carbon probes ( NSG10 DLC , ~2–5 nm radius of curvature at the tip ( K-Tek Nanotechnology , Wilsonville , OR ) driven near resonance at ~200 kHz . To minimize both sample and tip damage during scanning , the set point was set to the largest possible value ( largest average tip-sample distance ) that allowed good surface tracking . Raster scans ( 1 . 2 μm X 1 . 2 μm ) were performed at a resolution of 512x512 pixels with a scan rate of 1Hz . For presentation and analysis , images were first processed using a custom Matlab script ( Source code 1 provided ) to remove sample slant ( flattening ) by row and column-wise median subtraction . Individual molecules of each type were selected manually based on the following criteria: the whole object should be within the captured field without any part ( s ) being cropped by the borders , easily identified as isolated , individual , non-aggregated object with no overlap ( s ) with any other objects , and traceable/measurable . The number of selected molecules usually covered 40–70% of all the objects in the field , depending on the distribution of molecules and local quality of an image . To quantify the conformation of each molecule , a selected molecule was segmented into maximally 8 sections based on apparent structural features . The length of each segment ( X1 to X8 ) was measured with ImageJ by setting the measuring scale with the known image spatial size and outlining the molecule contour with the segmented line tool .

This complex multi-dimensional amalgam of inputs enables continuous adjustment of root growth rates , direction , and metabolic activity that define a dynamic physical network . Current methods for analyzing root biology balance physiological relevance with imaging capability . To bridge this divide , we developed an integrated-imaging system called Growth and Luminescence Observatory for Roots ( GLO-Roots ) that uses luminescence-based reporters to enable studies of root architecture and gene expression patterns in soil-grown , light-shielded roots . We have developed image analysis algorithms that allow the spatial integration of soil properties , gene expression , and root system architecture traits . We propose GLO-Roots as a system that has great utility in presenting environmental stimuli to roots in ways that evoke natural adaptive responses and in providing tools for studying the multi-dimensional nature of such processes .", "plain language summary": "Most plants absorb water and nutrients from the soil via structures called roots . The shape , size , and structure of a plant's root system can change over its lifetime as the plant responds to changes in their local environment . For example , if water is scarce , a plant may develop a very deep root system that is more efficient at capturing water . Understanding how root systems respond to environmental cues may help us to identify the genes and processes involved . In this study , Rellán-Álvarez et al . report a new live-imaging platform for analyzing root architecture and its regulation . This platform is called Growth and Luminescence Observatory for Roots ( or GLO-Roots for short ) and uses ‘luminescent’ markers that allow growing roots to be visualized when plants are grown in thin , soil-filled , transparent pots . GLO-Roots can track the growth of the plant roots as well as the activity of genes that respond to environmental stress . Rellán-Álvarez et al . developed a software tool called GLO-RIA ( GLO-Roots Image Analysis ) to analyze the resulting images . GLO-RIA performs several different types of image analysis , including one that detects the position , length , and direction of roots , as well as their shape and depth . Rellán-Álvarez et al . tested the GLO-Roots techniques in various ways , for example , by analyzing the effects that different conditions have on the growth of the roots of the model plant known as Arabidopsis thaliana . Depriving the plants of a nutrient called phosphorous caused the roots to grow more horizontally than when phosphorus is plentiful , presumably to allow the plants to expand their search for phosphate in the upper layers of the soil , where this nutrient is usually more abundant . On the other hand , a shortage of water caused the roots to grow more vertically to access water stored deeper in the soil . GLO-Roots can also be used to measure the water content of soil at different depths and how this influences the architecture of the root . Further experiments on tomato plants and a grass species called Brachypodium distachyon revealed the different architectures of their root systems . Rellán-Álvarez et al . propose that this system could be used to study the roots of other plant species in a variety of environmental conditions . This will provide a more detailed understanding of the ways that different plants adapt in response to changes in their environment .", "article": "1 Introduction Plant roots are three-dimensional assemblies of cells that coordinately monitor and acclimate to soil environmental change by altering physiological and developmental processes through cell-type and organ-specific regulatory mechanisms ( Dinneny et al . , 2008; Duan et al . , 2013 ) . Soil comprises a complex distribution of particles of different size , composition and physical properties , airspaces , variation in nutrient availability and microbial diversity ( Brady and Weil , 2009; Lynch and Wojciechowski , 2015 ) . These physical , chemical , and biological properties of soil can vary on spatial scales of meters to microns , and on temporal scales ranging from seasonal change to seconds . Root tips monitor this environment through locally and systemically acting sensory mechanisms ( Bao et al . , 2014; Tabata et al . , 2014 ) . The architecture of the root system determines the volume of soil where resources can be accessed by the plant ( rhizosphere ) and is under both environmental and genetic control . Plasticity in growth parameters allows the plant to adjust its form to suit a particular soil . Lateral roots , which usually make up the majority of the total root system , often grow at an angle divergent from the gravity vector . This gravity set-point angle is controlled by auxin biosynthesis and signaling and can be regulated by developmental age and root type ( Rosquete et al . , 2013 ) . Recent cloning of the DRO1 quantitative trait locus demonstrates that natural genetic variation is a powerful tool for uncovering such control mechanisms ( Uga et al . , 2013 ) . Specific root ideotypes ( idealized phenotypes ) have been proposed to be optimal for acquisition of water and nitrogen , which are distinct from ideotypes for low phosphorus . Based on computational modeling and field studies , the ‘steep , deep , and cheap’ ideotype proposed by Lynch and colleagues may provide advantages to the plant for capturing water and elements like nitrogen that are water soluble and therefore tend to move in the soil column with water . This ideotype consists of highly gravitropic , vertically oriented roots that grow deep in the soil column and develop large amounts of aerenchyma , which reduces the overall metabolic cost of the root system ( Lynch and Wojciechowski , 2015 ) . Other nutrients , like phosphorus , which have limited water solubility and are tightly bound to soil particles , usually accumulate in the top layers of soil and favor root systems that are more highly branched and shallow . The low-phosphorus ideotype effectively increases root exploration at the top layers of soil ( Lynch and Wojciechowski , 2015 ) . Modeling of root system variables shows that optimum architecture for nitrogen and phosphorus uptake is not the same ( Postma and Lynch , 2014 ) and suggests tradeoffs that may affect the evolution of root architecture as a population adapts to a particular environmental niche ( Laliberté et al . , 2013 ) . Clearly , understanding the architecture of root systems and how environmental conditions alter root developmental programs is important for understanding adaptive mechanisms of plants and for identifying the molecular-genetic basis for different response programs . In addition , root systems have complexity beyond their architecture that needs to be incorporated into our understanding of plant–environment interactions . Primary and lateral roots exhibit different stress response programs in Arabidopsis ( Duan et al . , 2013; Tian et al . , 2014 ) and may play specialized roles in water and nutrient uptake . Thus , it is important to develop methods that allow for a multidimensional characterization of the root system that includes growth , signaling , and interactions with other organisms . Furthermore , physiological parameters that affect whole-plant responses to the environment , such as transpiration , are likely integrated into such processes , thus , requiring a more holistic approach to studies of root function . Based on these considerations , we have developed a new root imaging platform , Growth and Luminescence Observatory for Roots ( GLO-Roots ) , which allows root architecture and gene expression to be studied in soil-grown plants . GLO-Roots is an integrated system composed of custom growth vessels , luminescent reporters , and imaging systems . We use rhizotrons that have soil volumes equivalent to small pots and support growth of Arabidopsis from germination to senescence . To visualize roots , we designed plant–codon-optimized luciferase reporters that emit light of different wavelengths . To visualize reporter expression , plants are watered with a dilute luciferin solution and imaged afterwards . We have built a custom luminescence-imaging system that automatically captures images of rhizotrons held vertically . The signal from each reporter is distinguished using band-pass filters held in a motorized filter wheel , which enables automated acquisition of images from plants expressing both structural and environmentally or developmentally responsive reporters . We have also developed GLO-RIA ( Growth and Luminescence Observatory Root Image Analysis ) , an ImageJ ( Schneider et al . , 2012 ) plugin that allows for automated determination of ( among other traits ) root system area , convex hull , depth , width , and directionality , a metric which quantifies the angle of root segments with respect to gravity . GLO-RIA is also able to relate root system parameters to local root-associated variables such as reporter expression intensity and soil-moisture content . Overall GLO-Roots has great utility in presenting environmental stimuli to roots in physiologically relevant ways and provides tools for characterizing responses to such stimuli at the molecular level in whole-adult root systems over broad time scales . 2 Results GLO-Roots is comprised of four parts: ( i ) growth vessels called rhizotrons that allow plant growth in soil and root imaging; ( ii ) luminescent reporters that allow various aspects of root biology to be tracked in living plants; ( iii ) GLO1 ( Growth and Luminescence Observatory 1 ) luminescence-imaging system designed to automatically image rhizotrons; ( iv ) GLO-RIA , an image analysis suite designed to quantify root systems imaged using GLO-Roots . The size of our rhizotrons enables undisturbed root system development ( before roots reach the sides or the bottom of the rhizotron ) for about 21–23 days for the Col-0 accession growing under long-day conditions ( Figure 2 , Figure 2—source data 1 ) ; however , root traits such as directionality can be observed through later stages of plant development . See 35 DAS root system and directionality in Figure 2A , B . An example of a time series spanning 11 to 21 days after sowing ( DAS ) of Col-0 roots expressing ProUBQ10:LUC2o is shown in Figure 2A and Video 1 with a color-coded time projection shown in Figure 2C . Directionality analysis ( Figure 2B ) shows a progressive change in root system angles from 0° ( vertical ) to 55° as lateral roots take over as the predominant root type . Figure 2D shows the evolution over time of several root traits that can be automatically captured by GLO-RIA ( depth , width , area ) and others that were manually quantified ( primary root growth rate or number of lateral roots per primary root ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 07597 . 017Figure 2 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 07597 . 019 As a proof of concept to estimate the utility of our root-imaging system to phenotype adult root system traits , we transformed a small set of accessions ( Bay-0 , Col-0 , and Sha ) with the ProUBQ10:LUC2o reporter and quantified root system architecture at 22 DAS ( Figure 3A–C , Figure 3—source data 1 ) . GLO-RIA analysis of these root systems identified several root traits that distinguish Col-0 , Bay-0 , and Sha . Directionality analysis revealed an abundance of steep-angle regions in the root system of Bay-0 , while Sha showed an abundance of shallow-angled regions and Col-0 was intermediate ( Figure 3D ) . Bay-0 shows the deepest and narrowest root system leading to the highest depth/width ratio , while Sha has the widest root system ( Figure 3E ) . Other root traits such as root system area and the vertical center of mass also showed significant differences ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1B ) . Broad-sense heritability values for depth ( 96 . 3 ) , area ( 92 . 0 ) , depth/width ( 97 . 8 ) , width ( 95 . 7 ) , and vertical center of mass ( 95 . 0 ) were all higher than 90% . 10 . 7554/eLife . 07597 . 020Figure 3 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 07597 . 024 To capture the richness of root architecture shape , we used GLO-RIA to extract pseudo-landmarks describing the shape of the root system ( see ‘Materials and methods’ for more details ) and performed PCA analysis ( Figure 3—source data 2 ) . The first principal component captures differences in the distribution of widths along the vertical axis and separates Col-0 and Sha from Bay-0 root systems ( Figure 3F ) . Bay-0 shows a homogenous distribution of widths along the vertical axis , while Sha and Col-0 are much wider at the top than bottom . PC2 seems to be capturing a relationship between width at the top and total depth and separates Sha root systems , which are wide at the top and deep from Col-0 root systems , which are wide but not as deep as Sha . Shape information extracted from pseudo-landmarks can distinguish the three different accession using PCA analysis ( Figure 3G , Figure 3—source data 3 ) . We tested whether spectrally distinct luciferase reporters would enable additional information besides root architecture to be captured from root systems . Luciferase reporters have been commonly used to study gene expression and these resources can potentially be utilized to study such regulatory events in soil-grown roots . We transformed ProACT2:PpyRE8o into two well-studied LUC reporter lines: the reactive oxygen species response reporter ProZAT12:LUC ( Miller et al . , 2009 ) ( Figure 4A , B ) and the auxin response reporter line ProDR5:LUC+ ( Moreno-Risueno et al . , 2010 ) ( Figure 4C , D ) . We implemented in GLO-RIA an algorithm that semi-automatically identifies gene reporter signal and associates this object to the corresponding root structure segment . A graphical representation of the results obtained with RootReporter can be observed in Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ( Figure 4—source data 1 ) . Reporter intensity values along the first 5 mm of root tips can also be observed in Figure 4—figure supplement 2 ( Figure 4—source data 2 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 07597 . 025Figure 4 .

Magnified portion of root systems colonized by P . fluorescens showing P . fluorescences ( B ) only or all three reporters together ( C ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 07597 . 032 We then took advantage of our ability to constitutively express two spectrally different luciferases and imaged the overlapping root systems ( one expressing ProUBQ10:LUC2o and the other ProACT2:PPyRE8o ) . While two root systems were distinguishable using this system ( Figure 4—figure supplement 3 ) ; measurements of root system area did not reveal a significant effect on root growth when two plants were grown in the same rhizotron , compared to one; however , further studies are warranted ( Figure 4—figure supplement 3 , Figure 4—source data 3 ) . The GLO-Roots system uses non-sterile growth conditions , which allows complex biotic interactions that may affect responses to the environment . Bacteria themselves can be engineered to express luminescent reporters through integration of the LUX operon , which results in luminescence in the blue region of the spectrum and is thus compatible with the plant-expressed luciferase isoforms we have tested . Pseudomonas fluorescens CH267 ( Haney et al . , 2015 ) , a natural Arabidopsis root commensal , was transformed with the bacterial LUX operon and used to inoculate plants . 13 days after inoculation , we were able to observe bacterial luminescence colocalizing with plant roots . P . fluorescens did not show an obvious pattern of colonization at the root system scale level ( Figure 4—figure supplement 4 ) . As a proof-of-principle test of the multi-dimensional capabilities of the GLO-Roots system , we visualized both LUC2o and PPyRE8o reporters in plants and the LUX reporter in bacteria in the same rhizotron ( Figure 4—figure supplement 4 ) . To examine the general applicability of the GLO-Roots system for other species , we introduced LUC2o-expressing reporters into the model grass Brachypodium distachyon and the crop plant Lycopersicon esculentum ( tomato ) . Brachypodium is well suited to the GLO-Root system because , like Arabidopsis , its small size allows mature root systems to be studied in relatively small soil volumes ( Watt et al . , 2009; Pacheco-Villalobos and Hardtke , 2012 ) . LUC2o driven by the ZmUb1 promoter was introduced into Brachypodium using the pANIC vector ( Mann et al . , 2012 ) . Brachypodium roots showed a distinct architecture from Arabidopsis marked by prolific development of secondary and tertiary lateral roots ( Figure 8A ) . This is consistent with other studies that show that Brachypodium has a typical grass root system ( Watt et al . , 2009 ) . Comparison of root system development in rhizotrons with gel-based media showed that root growth is higher in soil than in plates ( Figure 8—figure supplement 1 , Figure 8—source data 1 ) . Previous work has suggested that auxin levels in Brachypodium roots are sub-optimal for growth ( Pacheco-Villalobos et al . , 2013 ) . Pacheco-Villalobos and colleagues suggest that , in Brachypodium , and contrary to what happens in Arabidopsis , ethylene represses YUCCA reducing the synthesis of auxin . The reduced growth that we observe in plates and the high levels of ethylene that build up in sealed plates ( Buer et al . , 2003 ) would support this mechanism . 10 . 7554/eLife . 07597 . 051Figure 8 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 07597 . 053 Tomato plants were transformed with Pro35S:PPyRE8o and ProeDR5rev:LUC2 reporters . The plants showed more rapid growth than Arabidopsis or Brachypodium and required fertilizer to prevent obvious signs of stress ( reduced growth , anthocyanin accumulation ) . Root systems were imaged from 17 DAS plants . Roots showed presumptive lateral root primordia marked by DR5-expression ( Figure 8C , D ) . These results show that the GLO-Roots method can be applied to study root systems of different plant species and will likely be useful for studying root systems of other small- to medium-sized model plants and for early stages of larger crop plants . 3 Discussion Recent studies of root systems has emphasized structural attributes as important contributors of root system function . Indeed , studies examining the role of genetic variants in tolerating abiotic stress have demonstrated the importance of such characteristics ( Uga et al . , 2013 ) . Roots , however , are highly diverse in the biology they perform and a multi-dimensional understanding of root systems , which incorporates differences in signaling , metabolism , and microbial association as well as structure , may provide a clearer understanding of the degree to which sub-functionalization of the root system plays a role in important processes such as acclimation and efficient resource acquisition . We have developed tools in GLO-Roots that allow for tracking multiple aspects of soil physicochemical properties and root biology simultaneously . Using GLO-Roots , we are able to map in 2D coordinates the soil physical properties such as soil moisture together with root architecture traits such as directionality , growth rates , and gene expression levels . All this information is aggregated in layers for each x , y coordinate . Using GLO-RIA , we integrate this multilayer information , leveraging our ability to simultaneously and seamlessly investigate root responses to environmental stimuli such as soil-moisture content . Luciferases that emit light at different wavelengths allow for constitutive and regulated promoters to be studied together . Introduction of luciferase reporters into microbes provides an additional layer of information that is a readout of the association between organisms and how this might be affected by environmental conditions . The flexibility of the GLO-Roots system may enable additional dimensionality to our understanding of root biology . Other physical properties such as CO2 or pH mapping in rhizotrons have already been enabled by using planar optodes ( Blossfeld et al . , 2013 ) . It may be possible to engineer LUX-based reporters in microbes that are responsive to extracellular metabolites , creating microbial biosensors , and integration of such tools may enable root-exudation and nutrition to be analyzed in soil . Split-luciferase reporters have been engineered that allow bi-molecular interactions to be studied . Finally , molecular sensors analogous to Förster resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) sensors , termed bioluminescence resonance energy transfer ( BRET ) -sensors ( Shaw and Ehrhardt , 2013 ) , may allow metabolite tracking dynamically through the root system . With additional innovation in the development of luciferase reporters , the GLO-Roots system will likely expand the repertoire of biological processes that can be studied over an expanded range of developmental time points and environmental conditions . It has been proposed that plants with steep root systems will be better able to tap into deep water resources and thus perform better under water deficit . For example in rice , the IR64 paddy cultivar shows shallow root systems in upland fields , whereas Kinandang Patong , an upland cultivar , is deeper rooting ( Uga et al . , 2013 ) . Plants maintain a number of regulatory pathways that mediate changes in physiology during WD . Enhanced growth of root systems has been well characterized in field-grown plants; however , this has not been recapitulated in studies of gel-grown Arabidopsis plants . Thus , it has been unclear whether Arabidopsis simply responds to WD differently . Our results here show that Arabidopsis does indeed maintain a classical WD response that expands the root system and directs growth downward . Interestingly , under our stress regime , we did not observe a significant decrease in the relative water content of shoot tissues ( Figure 6—figure supplement 5 , Figure 6—source data 5 ) , suggesting that the changes in root architecture were sufficient to provide access to deep water and prevent dehydration . Such changes in root growth are likely regulated through systemic and local signaling that involve auxin signaling but acts independently of known pathways that control moisture-directed root growth . Understanding plant biology requires a sophisticated understanding of how environmental stimuli affect the form and function of plants as well as an understanding of how physiological context informs such responses . Environmental conditions are at least as complex as the plants they affect . Plant roots are exposed to a variety of environmental signals that change in time and space at very different scales that are integrated at the whole-plant system . It is an important challenge in biology to develop methods of growing and studying plants that present such stimuli in a manner that the plant is likely to encounter in nature . After all , the plants we study have evolved to survive through mechanisms that have been selected , over evolutionary time , in nature . It will be interesting for future studies to determine how other environmental stimuli affect root growth using GLO-Roots and whether these responses differ between accessions of Arabidopsis . Identification of the genetic loci responsible for phenotypic variation in adult root phenotypes may identify the molecular basis for adaptive variation that exists in this species and potentially identify loci that are useful for breeding efforts needed for the next green revolution . 4 Materials and methods Seeds were surface sterilized as described before ( Duan et al . , 2013 ) and grown in rhizotrons , 100 cm3 pots , or on two types of 1% agar ( Difco , Becton , Dickinson and Company , Franklin Lakes , NJ ) media containing either 1× MS nutrients ( Caisson Labs , Smithfield , UT ) and 1% Sucrose , ( termed ms media ) or ¼× MS nutrients only ( termed ms25 media ) . Both media were buffered using 0 . 5 g/l MES and pH was adjusted to 5 . 7 with KOH . All plants were grown together in a growth cabinet with LED lights under long-day conditions ( 16-hr day/8-hr night ) . Root and shoot tissue was collected separately from individual plants at the end of the day ( 1 hr before the lights shut off ) and at the end of the night ( 1 hr before lights came on ) . Three biological replicates were collected for each condition . RNA was extracted using the Plant RNA MiniPrepTM kit ( ZYMO Research , Irvine , CA ) according to manufacturer's instructions with on-column DNase treatment ( Qiagen ) . cDNA was made using the iScript Advanced cDNA Synthesis for RT-qPCR kit ( Bio-Rad ) from 200 ng of total RNA . qRT-PCR was performed using a Fluidigm BioMarkTM 96 . 96 Dynamic Array IFC with the EvaGreen ( Bio-Rad ) fluorescence probe according to the Fluidigm Advanced Development Protocol number 37 . For the analysis , all the reactions with no amplification ( Ct = 999 ) were set to the maximal Ct for that assay type . The two technical replicates were then averaged and dCt values calculated using AT3G07480 , AT4G37830 , At1g13320 , and At1g13440 as reference internal controls . PCA plots were generated with Devium Web ( Dmitry Grapov , 2014 ) using dCt values . dCT values were calculated as dCT = CT∼gene interest∼ − mean ( CT∼reference gene∼ ) .

The behavior of proteins depends on their structure; yet , proteins are often flexible and will change shape , much like a tree in the wind . Nevertheless , for some of the activities that it performs , a protein must adopt one specific shape . Therefore , the likelihood that the protein will take on this specific shape directly determines how efficiently that protein can perform a specific job . The shape of a protein can be regulated by changes at several levels; these could include modifying one of the amino acid building blocks that make up that protein , binding to another protein , or by placing the protein in a part of the cell that is crowded with other large molecules . Schmid and Hugel wanted to understand how these three different types of regulation affect the structure of a protein and how they relate to its activities . The protein Hsp90 was used as a test case . It typically exists with two copies of the protein bound together , either in a parallel or a V-shape . Hsp90 plays several important roles in metabolism and can break down molecules of ATP , the so-called energy currency of the cell . All three types of regulation favored the Hsp90 pairs taking the parallel structure and increased its breakdown of ATP . The results suggest that the Hsp90 pair has a flexible structure , and that reducing this flexibility can improve Hsp90’s efficiency in carrying out its role . It was particularly unexpected that the large-scale , unspecific effect of placing the protein in a crowded environment could have such similar results to a small-scale , precise change of a single amino acid within the protein . While all three forms of regulation help to stabilize the parallel structure for Hsp90 , they do this through different mechanisms , which influence the speed and the way that the protein transitions between the two structures . Schmid and Hugel believe that these results offer a new perspective on how diversely the shape and function of proteins is controlled at the molecular level , which could have wider implications for medical diagnostics and treatment .", "article": "1 Introduction Protein function is essential for life as we know it . It is largely encoded in a protein’s amino-acid chain that dictates not only the specific 3D structure , but also the conformational flexibility and dynamics of a protein in a given environment . Precise regulation of protein function is vital for every living cell to cope with an ever-changing environment , and occurs on many levels pre- and post-translationally ( Vogel and Marcotte , 2012; Hirano et al . , 2016 ) . After translation by the ribosome , protein function depends strongly on post-translational modifications ( PTMs ) ( Deribe et al . , 2010 ) , but also on binding of nucleotides ( Hodge and Ridley , 2016 ) , cofactors ( Weikum et al . , 2017 ) , various protein-protein interactions ( PPIs ) ( Scott et al . , 2016 ) , and global effects , such as temperature ( Danielsson et al . , 2015 ) , macro-molecular crowding and phase separation ( Uversky , 2017 ) , redox conditions ( Levin et al . , 2017 ) , osmolarity ( de Nadal and Posas , 2015 ) etc . Importantly , this regulation occurs on very diverse levels of localization . Global effects affect the whole protein non-specifically , PPIs act at a given interface and site-specific modifications are very localized . Nevertheless , all of them influence the molecular properties that determine the 3D conformation , the conformational dynamics , and thereby also the function of a protein ( Schwenkert et al . , 2014; Lewandowski et al . , 2015; Schummel et al . , 2016; Wei et al . , 2016; Csizmok and Forman-Kay , 2018 ) . The chaperone protein Hsp90 ( Schopf et al . , 2017 ) is an excellent test system to investigate diverse regulation mechanisms ( Stetz et al . , 2018 ) . It was recently discussed that a single PTM can functionally mimic a specific co-chaperone interaction in human Hsp90 ( Zuehlke et al . , 2017 ) . Here we take a next step and disentangle how a PTM-related point mutation , a co-chaperone interaction , and macro-molecular crowding affect the function , kinetics , and thermodynamics of this multi-domain protein . Hsp90 is an important metabolic hub . Assisted by about twenty known cochaperones , yeast Hsp90 is involved in the maturation of 20% of the entire proteome ( Taipale et al . , 2010 ) . Among its substrates ( referred to as ‘clients’ ) are many kinases involved in signal transduction , hormone receptors , the 'guardian of the genome p53' ( Lane , 1992 ) , and also cytoskeletal proteins such as actin , tubulin , and many more ( Pearl and Prodromou , 2006; Khandelwal et al . , 2016 ) . Cancer cells were found to be ‘addicted’ to Hsp90 ( Trepel et al . , 2010 ) , which is therefor also a prominent drug target in cancer research . Hsp90 is a homo-dimer where each monomer consists of three domains ( Ali et al . , 2006 ) : the N-terminal domain ( N ) with a slow ATPase function , the middle domain ( M ) believed to be the primary client interaction site ( Verba et al . , 2016 ) , and the C-terminal domain providing the main dimerization contacts . Apart from closed conformations , where the three domains align in parallel , Hsp90 exists primarily in V-shaped , open conformations with dissociated N-terminal and middle domains ( Krukenberg et al . , 2008; Hellenkamp et al . , 2017 ) . Both global arrangements are semi-stable at room temperature . As a consequence , Hsp90 alternates constantly between open and closed conformations - even in the absence of the chemical energy source , ATP ( Mickler et al . , 2009; Schmid et al . , 2016; Lee et al . , 2019 ) . Surprisingly , the characteristic conformational changes of Hsp90 are only little affected by e . g . anti-cancer drug candidates ( Schmid et al . , 2018 ) or natural nucleotides ( Schmid et al . , 2016 ) . In addition , to the stress-induced isoform discussed herein ( Hsp82 ) , there is also a cognate isoform ( Hsc82 ) in yeast , which differs in unfolding stability , client range and more , despite 97% sequence identity ( Girstmair et al . , 2019 ) . Here , we present three orthogonal ways to modulate Hsp90's conformational state space , illustrated in Figure 1 . The investigated point mutation A577I is located in the C-terminal hinge region of Hsp90 . Residue A577 is the equivalent of the post-translational S-nitrosylation site C598 in human Hsp90 ( Martínez-Ruiz et al . , 2005 ) . While nitrosylation of that residue has a two-fold inhibitory effect – on the ATPase function and the client stimulation by human Hsp90 – the A577I mutation caused a nearly 4-fold amplification of the ATPase rate ( Retzlaff et al . , 2009 ) . The fact that the point mutation is located in the C-terminal domain and the ATP binding site in the N-domain indicates a long-range communication , offering valuable mechanistic insight in Hsp90’s intra-molecular plasticity . Second , we consider the protein-protein interactions between Hsp90 and the activating co-chaperone Aha1 , which is a well-known stimulator of Hsp90's inherently slow ATPase activity . It makes contacts to the middle and N-terminal domain , which rearranges the ATP lid ( Schulze et al . , 2016 ) , and the catalytic loop ( including R380 ) ( Pearl , 2016 ) in a favorable way for ATP hydrolysis . The affinity of Aha1 for Hsp90 itself is also markedly enhanced by PTMs ( Xu et al . , 2019 ) . The third way of modulation mimics the crowding encountered in the cell , which is full of proteins , nucleic acids , vesicles and organelles . We mimic cellular macro-molecular crowding using the common crowding agent Ficoll400 , that is branched polymeric sucrose . In contrast to the previous two modulations , crowding represents a completely non-specific , physical interference . At first sight , all three modulations provoke a similar steady-state behavior in Hsp90 . But our single-molecule experiments allow us to disentangle the different underlying causes thereof . 2 Results First we follow yeast Hsp90's conformational kinetics in real-time using single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer ( smFRET ) measured on a total-internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscope ( Figure 2a ) . The FRET pair configuration displayed in Figure 2a ( top ) results in low FRET efficiency ( little acceptor fluorescence ) for V-shaped , open conformations of Hsp90 , and high FRET efficiency ( intense acceptor fluorescence ) for more compact , closed conformations . This allows us to obtain steady-state information , like the population of closed conformations , and also the kinetics of conformational changes ( Schmid et al . , 2016; Roy et al . , 2008; Lerner et al . , 2018; Mazal and Haran , 2019 ) . Example traces obtained from three Hsp90 molecules under different conditions are displayed in Figure 2b: First for the point mutant A577I , then in the presence of the cochaperone Aha1 , and lastly under macro-molecular crowding by Ficoll400 . The observed transitions between the low- and high-FRET states reflect global opening or closing . Figure 2c shows the steady-state ( equilibrium ) population of open and closed conformations . In all three cases , a shift toward closed conformations is observed with respect to the corresponding reference distribution obtained under equivalent experimental conditions ( see caption of Figure 2 and Materials and methods for details ) . The optimal buffer conditions for each of the three cases differ slightly , which explains the differences between the three reference datasets displayed in Figure 2c ( black lines ) . Relative populations and their uncertainties were obtained by bootstrapping ( see Materials and methods and Supplementary file 1 ) . The A577I mutation increased the closed population from ( 13 ± 3 . 5 ) % to ( 51 ± 5 . 5 ) % . This is a large effect considering that no big change in hydrophobic nor charged interactions is expected to result from this hydrophobic-to-hydrophobic point mutation . In particular , as the slightly bulkier isoleucine side chain points outward in the crystal structure of Hsp90’s closed conformation ( Ali et al . , 2006 ) . In addition to the A577I homodimer , already the A577I/wild type ( wt ) hetero-dimer shows a considerably larger population of closed conformations , especially in the presence of ATP ( Figure 2—figure supplement 3 ( left ) ) . Under ADP conditions the additive effect is also observed , but weaker ( Figure 2—figure supplement 3 ( right ) ) . Under both conditions , the second A577I in the homodimer leads to a further shift toward closed conformations . The slight but consistent shift of the corresponding low-FRET peak in Figure 2c ( left ) could be explained by a sterical hindrance of the farthest opening in the A577I homodimer . Furthermore , very fast transitions at the temporal resolution limit ( 200 ms ) occurred more frequently , which can be seen by the increased overlap between the two populations . Both , sterical hindrance and faster transitions , can be interpreted as a global stiffening of Hsp90’s structural core formed by the C- and middle domain . The interaction with Aha1 ( Figure 2c , center ) forms inter-domain ( N–M ) and inter-monomer contacts . The latter increase the affinity for N-N binding , and thus cause Hsp90 to shift from ( 24 ± 4 . 0 ) % closed to ( 48 ± 5 . 0 ) % closed population , which is in line with previous qualitative reports ( Hessling et al . , 2009; Wortmann et al . , 2017 ) . Lastly , macro-molecular crowding increased the closed population from ( 11 ± 4 . 5 ) % to ( 50 ± 10 . 5 ) % , in agreement with previous ensemble findings ( Halpin et al . , 2016 ) . In contrast , to the A577I mutant , crowding slowed down fast fluctuation at the resolution limit , which creates well-separated populations in Figure 2c ) . The induced shift toward closed conformations appears in a concentration-dependent manner , as can be seen in Figure 2—figure supplement 4 . In contrast to polymeric , branched sucrose ( Ficoll400 ) , monomeric sucrose had only negligible effect on the steady-state populations . This proves that macro-molecular crowding is the cause of the observed population shift , and a biochemical glucose-associated reason can be dismissed . In all three cases , a clear shift toward closed conformations is observed , although to slightly different extents . Importantly , based on these distributions alone , the energetic origin of the population shift remains unclear . That is whether the observations arise from a stabilization of closed conformations , or a destabilization of the open conformations , or even a combination of both . To answer these questions , we solved the full kinetic rate model , presented below . Figure 3a shows the kinetic rate models describing Hsp90's global opening and closing dynamics . The significant changes caused by each type of modulation are highlighted in red and green as indicated . The corresponding quantitative rate changes and confidence intervals are displayed in Figure 3b . We used the Single-Molecule Analysis of Complex Kinetic Sequences ( SMACKS [Schmid et al . , 2016] ) to quantify rate constants and uncertainties directly from the smFRET raw data . For Hsp90’s global conformational changes , we consistently infer 4-state models ( Schmid et al . , 2016; Schmid et al . , 2018; Schmid and Hugel , 2018 ) : two low-FRET states ( open conformations ) and two high-FRET states ( closed conformations ) . Although only two different FRET efficiencies can be resolved , at least four kinetic states are needed to describe the observed kinetic heterogeneity . Based on recent results ( Hellenkamp et al . , 2017 ) , we expect an entire ensemble of open sub-conformations that - on the timescale of the experiment - are sufficiently well described by two kinetically different low-FRET states . The two closed states , one short-lived ( state 2 ) and one longer-lived ( state 3 ) , likely differ in local conformational elements ( Giannoulis et al . , 2020; Huang et al . , 2019 ) . The well-known N-terminal beta-sheet with or without its cross-monomer contacts ( as observed in the closed crystal structure [Ali et al . , 2006] ) could explain the additional stabilization of state 3 with respect to state 2 . All states 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 of this highly dynamic Hsp90 system represent conformational ensembles that are defined by their FRET efficiency and their kinetics ( rather than discrete or ‘frozen’ conformations ) . In the case of the cochaperone Aha1 , the shift in the FRET efficiency histogram originates from opposing changes of the fast rates between states 1 and 2 ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) . This is in contrast to the effect of the C-terminal point mutation A577I , which collectively accelerates the pathway from state 0 via state 1 and state 2 to state 3 . Note that a kinetic model with only three links - similar to the model for crowding in Figure 3a , right - is statistically sufficient ( according to likelihood ratio testing detailed in Schmid et al . , 2016 SI point 1 . 2 ) to describe the observed kinetics of the A577I homodimer , implying less kinetically heterogeneous fluctuations ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2 ) . Under macro-molecular crowding , changes of the conformational dynamics are visible already from the stationary distributions: as shown in Figure 2a , the low and high FRET populations are most separated in this case . This is indicative of fast fluctuations , at or below the timescale of the sampling rate ( 5 Hz ) that are slowed down at higher viscosity . Still , transitions between open and closed conformations are regularly observed in the experiment ( Figure 3—figure supplement 3 ) . For the fully resolved kinetics , the main difference is observed for the rates between the closed states 2 and 3 . This agrees with the increase of the closed population under macro-molecular – but not small molecular – crowding . Altogether , Figure 3 shows three completely different kinetic effects that underlie seemingly analogous ensemble behavior . Based on the complete kinetic rate models , we can now deduce the impact on free energies along a specific spatial reaction coordinate , here the N-terminal extension ( Figure 4 ) . The point mutation A577I causes an asymmetric destabilization of open conformations . Aha1 leads to simultaneous destabilization of open conformations and stabilization of closed conformations , whereas macro-molecular crowding only stabilizes closed conformations . Importantly , this information is not accessible from the steady-state distributions in Figure 2c . The collective shift toward closed conformations is accompanied by an overall increase in ATPase activity under all three conditions ( Figure 5 ) : 7-fold for A577I , 17-fold for Aha1 , 4-fold for crowding , respectively . Thus , the increase in ATP hydrolysis rate does not reflect the increase in the closed population observed in Figure 2c . This is a first indication of causalities that involve more than just the occurrence of closed conformations . In the following , we dissect the molecular origins of the increased ATPase activity . The effect of macro-molecular crowding can serve as an estimate of the ATPase stimulation caused exclusively by the relative stabilization of closed conformations , because a biochemical interaction of sucrose was excluded in control experiments ( see above ) . Remarkably , the entirely non-specific interaction leads already to a considerable ATPase acceleration of a factor 4 . This supports the wide-spread notion that the closed conformation represents Hsp90's active state ( Prodromou , 2012 ) . But , in comparison to the biochemical effect of the cochaperone Aha1 , the stimulation by crowding is still modest , despite the much larger closed population . Specifically , the 4 . 5-fold increased closed population , comes with a 4-fold increased ATPase activity , whereas in the presence of Aha1 already a 2-fold increased closed population is accompanied by a 17-fold ATPase stimulation . The fact that Aha1 induces the smallest increase in closed population , but under the same conditions the largest ATPase stimulation , highlights the functional importance of specific contacts between Aha1 and Hsp90 , which are responsible for 88% of the ATPase stimulation by Aha1 . In the case of the A577I mutant a 3 . 9-fold increased closed population comes with a 7-fold ATPase amplification . This could result from the mentioned hindrance of extremely open states indicating a conformational stiffening , restricting Hsp90's native flexibility . In other words , not only changes in the equilibrium , but also changes in the kinetics affect the ATPase activity as discussed below . A comparison of the observed changes on the conformational steady-state and the ATPase rate allows us to estimate the contribution of conformational confinement in each case ( Supplementary file 1B ) . We find that conformational confinement accounts for 100% of the ATPase stimulation induced by macro-molecular crowding , for 60% of the stimulation by the point mutation A577I , and for only 10% of the stimulation by cochaperone Aha1 . The contribution of conformational confinement is thus largest for purely non-specific interactions , while additional allosteric effects may increase the stimulation by A577I , and specific rearrangements of the active site dominate the stimulating action of cochaperone Aha1 . Our data do not indicate additional combinatorial effects of these three stimulations , which can be investigated in a future study . 3 Discussion Herein we compare three types of Hsp90 modulations , spanning a wide range from a site-specific point mutation , via cochaperone binding , to completely non-specific macro-molecular crowding . All three modulations provoke a similar steady-state ( equilibrium ) behavior , namely an increase in Hsp90's closed conformation and in Hsp90's ATPase rate . In contrast , they show significant differences in their kinetics , which could be revealed by single-molecule FRET . This can be rationalized by the emerging picture of yeast Hsp90 , as a very flexible dimer that relies critically on external assistance ( e . g . by cochaperones ) to control its non-productive flexibility . For example , Hsp90’s ATPase function requires the concerted action of the N-terminal nucleotide binding pocket with the ATP lid and distant elements such as the catalytic loop of the middle domain and parts of the opposite N-domain ( the N-terminal β1-α1 segment ) . These elements – also called the catalytic unit ( Prodromou , 2012 ) - however , are very flexible , such as the entire multi-domain dimer . Consequently , anything that constrains this flexibility and confines Hsp90 in a more compact conformation , has a high potential to increase the combined probability for such a concerted action - be it by specific or even non-specific interaction . Figure 6 shows that the functional impact of conformational confinement can be understood as a direct result of combinatorics: in a flexible protein such as Hsp90 , the catalytically active elements have many translational and rotational degrees of freedom . Thus , the probability for a certain hydrolysis-competent conformation is very small . It is however increased dramatically by conditions that constrain these degrees of freedom – even non-specifically – and localize the catalytically active elements . This notion can be further extended to cochaperone binding , and it also explains mutual effects upon client interaction . We conclude , while Hsp90’s flexibility may facilitate its numerous interactions with diverse clients and cochaperones , the flexibility itself has substantial off-state character regarding the ATPase function of Hsp90 . In turn , by directly affecting the lifetime of the nucleotide/active site contacts and the resulting structural stabilization , ATP hydrolysis controls also longer-range allosteric effects linked to these residues . A closer look at the regulation of Hsp90's conformational energy landscape by single-molecule FRET shows the many ways to reach similar ensemble results . The point mutation A557I destabilizes the open conformation , most probably by preventing access to a subset of the conformational ensemble of open states . This leads to an overall stiffened structure ( more confined ) of the A577I homodimer and therefore less extensive random walks , that is a more streamlined conformational transition toward the closed conformations . Macro-molecular crowding stabilizes the closed conformation by simple , sterical confinement . The cochaperone Aha1 combines both mechanisms with additional specific rearrangements . In theory , all three modulations can lead to the exactly same thermodynamic observation , and in fact we observe very similar steady-state distributions . Nevertheless , the kinetics may still vary significantly – as experimentally demonstrated herein . This is an important mathematical fact that holds true for all protein systems . Moreover , our findings indicate that regulation by cochaperones - and protein-protein interactions in general - can have far-reaching thermodynamic , kinetic , and functional consequences . Some of them can possibly be mimicked by individual point mutations , but other consequences might be missed . Lastly , as shown in this work , already non-specific , purely physical macro-molecular crowding has strong effects on thermodynamics , kinetics and function , therefore caution is advised when relating in vitro findings to in vivo function . Certain mutations that show little or no ATPase activity in vitro , may be ‘rescued’ by the conformational confinement in the crowded cellular environment , and still be ATPase active in vivo . As demonstrated herein , in many in vitro experiments macro-molecular crowding could easily be included . In conclusion , we demonstrated herein three ways of protein regulation , ranging from site-specific localized to global modulations . All three ways show very similar thermodynamic observations , which are , however , caused by clearly different conformational kinetics . This is direct evidence for the importance of kinetics , and of the dynamic structure–function relationship in proteins . The reduction of non-productive structural flexibility stimulates Hsp90’s ATPase function even by entirely non-specific means . Our findings demonstrate that functional stimulation as a result of conformational combinatorics plays an important role in protein regulation . We anticipate that such conformational confinement - by localized or global modulations - is an important mechanistic concept with wide-spread implications for protein function in diverse systems . 4 Materials and methods Yeast Hsp90 dimers ( UniProtKB: P02829 ) with a C-terminal coiled-coil motif ( kinesin neck region of D . melanogaster ) were used to avoid dissociation at low concentrations ( Mickler et al . , 2009 ) . Previously published cysteine positions ( Hessling et al . , 2009 ) allowed for specific labeling with donor ( 61C ) or acceptor ( 385C ) fluorophores ( see below ) . Point mutation A577I was introduced using QuikChange Lightning Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit ( Agilent Technologies ) . The constructs were cloned into a pET28b vector ( Novagen , Merck Biosciences , Billerica , MA ) . They include an N-terminal His-tag followed by a SUMO-domain for later tag cleavage . The QuickChange Lightning kit ( Agilent Technologies , Santa Clara , CA ) was used to insert an Avitag for specific in vivo biotinylation at the C-terminus of the acceptor construct . Escherichia coli BL21star cells ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) were cotransformed with pET28b and pBirAcm ( Avidity Nanomedicines , La Jolla , CA ) by electroporation ( Peqlab , Erlangen , Germany ) and expressed according to Avidity’s in vivo biotinylation protocol . The donor construct was expressed in E . coli BL21 ( DE3 ) cod+ ( Stratagene , San Diego , CA ) for 3 hr at 37°C after induction with 1 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) at OD600 = 0 . 7 in LBKana . A cell disruptor ( Constant Systems , Daventry , United Kingdom ) was used for lysis in both cases . Proteins were purified as published ( Jahn et al . , 2014 ) ( Ni-NTA , tag cleavage , anion exchange , size exclusion chromatography ) . 95% purity was confirmed by SDS-PAGE . Fluorescent labels ( Atto550- and Atto647N-maleimide ) were purchased from Atto-tec ( Siegen , Germany ) and coupled to cysteins according to the supplied protocol . If not stated differently , all chemicals were purchased from Sigma Aldrich , St . Louis , MO . Single-molecule FRET ( smFRET ) was measured as previously detailed using a home built TIRF setup ( Schmid et al . , 2016 ) . Hetero-dimers ( acceptor + donor ) were obtained by 20 min incubation of 1 µM donor and 0 . 1 µM biotinylated acceptor homodimers in measurement buffer ( 40 mM Hepes , 150 mM KCl , and 10 mM MgCl2 , pH7 . 5 ) at 47°C . This favors biotinylated heterodimers to bind to the polyethylene glycol ( PEG , Rapp Polymere , Tuebingen , Germany ) passivated and neutravidin ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA ) coated fluid chamber . Residual homodimers are recognized using alternating laser excitation ( ALEX ) of donor and acceptor dyes ( Lee et al . , 2005; Hellenkamp et al . , 2018 ) and excluded from analysis . For optimal interaction affinity with Aha1 , measurements were performed in low salt buffer ( 40 mM Hepes , 20 mM KCl , 5 mM MgCl2 , pH 7 . 5 with 3 . 5 µM Aha1 and 2 mM ATP ) . For comparison , data without Aha1 were measured accordingly . Notably , significant binding was previously found for Aha1 with labeled Hsp90-385C at much lower concentration of 0 . 3 µM ( Li et al . , 2013 ) , which is exactly the dissociation constant reported for unlabeled Hsp90 ( Panaretou et al . , 2002 ) . This implies that , although not directly detectable in the experiment , Hsp90 exists predominantly in complex with Aha1 under the used conditions . A577I/wt constructs were created through monomer exchange ( see above ) . They are distinguished from both kinds of homodimers through the fluorescence signal ( donor+acceptor ) . Measurements were performed in measurement buffer plus 2 mM ATP if not stated differently . Macro-molecular crowding was mimicked by 20wt% polymeric sucrose , known as Ficoll400 ( Sigma Aldrich ) in measurement buffer if not stated differently . Single-molecule FRET trajectories were selected , and corrected for background , donor leakage , acceptor direct excitation , as well as different fluorescence quantum yields , detection efficiencies , excitation efficiencies , and laser powers , as described before ( Hellenkamp et al . , 2018 ) . The uncertainties of steady-state populations were estimated by bootstrapping: out of each dataset , random subsets ( or samples ) containing two thirds of the total number of traces were drawn with replacement . A histogram was compiled for each subset , and fitted with a double-Gaussian fit function and fixed peak positions from Figure 3—figure supplement 2 . Relative populations were obtained for each histogram . This was repeated for 1000 subsets . We report the means of 1000 such populations , and as an uncertainty measure their standard deviations ( rounded upwards to 0 . 5 ) . See also Supplementary file 1A . SMACKS is based on two-dimensional semi-ensemble Hidden Markov models ( HMMs ) , as described in detail earlier ( Schmid et al . , 2016 ) . In brief , smFRET donor and acceptor fluorescence traces serve as input data . SMACKS comes in two steps . First , individual HMMs are optimized for each molecule separately , to allow for the experimentally observed intensity differences between different molecules . The resulting emission parameters for each molecule – that is Gaussian mean and variance representing the fluorescence intensity levels - are then used for the second step: the semi-ensemble HMM optimization . Now the kinetic parameters – so-called start and transition probabilities – are ensemble-optimized based on an entire dataset , using the individual emission parameters of the first step . The transition probabilities are converted into rate constants by considering the sampling rate of the experiment ( frames per second ) . Several such HMM optimizations with increasing model size ( i . e . numbers of states ) are calculated , and compared using the Bayesian Information Criterion ( BIC ) , which reproducibly yields four states for Hsp90’s characteristic conformational dynamics: two open , two closed . Within the four-state model , we determine the most likely number of links using likelihood ratio tests following the hierarchical search for simplified models described in Bruno et al . , 2005 . ATPase activity was measured at 37°C coupled to NADH oxidation , which was followed as a decrease in absorption at 340 nm using an ATP regenerative assay similar to Tamura and Gellert , 1990: 0 . 2 mM NADH Di-Na ( Roche , Basel , CH ) ; 2 mM phosphoenol pyruvate K-salt ( Bachem , Bubendorf , CH ) ; 2 U/ml pyruvate kinase , Roche; 10 U/ml lactate dehydrogenase , Roche; in 40 mM Hepes , 150 mM KCl , 10 mM MgCl2 , pH 7 . 5 ."}

When a cell requires a certain protein , the corresponding DNA sequence is first transcribed into molecules of ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) known as transcripts . These sequences of RNA are then read by the cell and translated into the desired protein sequence . Errors in copying DNA before a cell divides , can lead to genetic mutations that affect the ability of the cell to carry out certain roles , influencing the overall ‘fitness’ of the cell . Similar to genetic mutations , errors that arise when forming RNA transcripts may also alter the tasks a cell performs . However , it is difficult to find out what kinds of errors cells have in their transcripts and how often these mistakes occur . This is because current methods for sequencing RNA are prone to technical inaccuracies that interfere with the ability to detect true transcript errors . Now , Li and Lynch have adapted a method for high-throughput sequencing of RNA , which can accurately identify transcript errors in Escherichia coli and other species of bacteria . The experiments showed that errors in RNA molecules occurred more frequently than genetic mutations in the same sequence of DNA . Li and Lynch also found that the transcripts contained more nonsense errors – that is , mutations which prematurely stop transcripts from being translated , resulting in shorter proteins – at the end of the RNA molecule than at the beginning or middle . It is possible that transcripts with errors at the beginning or the middle are more efficiently eliminated than those at the end , suggesting that bacteria have a quality-control mechanism for removing transcripts with premature stop sequences . These findings suggest that at any one-time cells carry thousands of transcripts with inaccuracies in their sequence , which likely impact the tasks cells perform . The next step will be to investigate how these different transcript errors affect the fitness of cells .", "article": "1 Introduction Transcript errors refer to any inconsistencies between RNA transcripts and their corresponding genomic loci . They can occur during ribonucleotide ( rNTP ) incorporations by RNA polymerases and/or via post-transcriptional modifications . Errors on RNA transcripts may directly cause dysfunctions due to the regulatory roles of small RNAs and the fate determination of mRNAs by RNA structural motifs ( Strathern et al . , 2012 ) . Such errors can also indirectly induce various effects at the protein level . Transcript errors can inactivate proteins and result in a loss-of-function ( Gordon et al . , 2013 ) . They can also indirectly give rise to misfolded proteins and induce proteotoxic stress ( Gout et al . , 2017; Vermulst et al . , 2015 ) . Errors on RNA transcripts may be causal factors leading to neuron degenerative diseases ( van Leeuwen et al . , 1998a; van Leeuwen et al . , 1998b ) and tumorigenesis ( Saxowsky et al . , 2008 ) . Therefore , transcript errors represent a significant potential mechanism influencing cellular integrity and fitness . Reporter-construct assays have long been the major approach to evaluating the fidelity of RNA polymerases and identifying transcript errors ( Blank et al . , 1986; Bubunenko et al . , 2017; Nesser et al . , 2006; Rosenberger and Foskett , 1981; Rosenberger and Hilton , 1983; Shaw et al . , 2002; Springgate and Loeb , 1975; Strathern et al . , 2012 ) , but these methods focus only on individual loci and cannot identify errors without phenotypic marker effects . Conventional high-throughput sequencing approaches have been considered to identify transcript errors at a large scale ( van Dijk et al . , 2015 ) . However , the challenge is to distinguish the real signal of transcript errors from noise produced by technical errors resulting during reverse transcription and sequencing . To circumvent this problem , a rolling-circle amplification-based sequencing ( CirSeq ) method ( Acevedo and Andino , 2014; Acevedo et al . , 2014; Lou et al . , 2013 ) was recently proposed and later applied to identify transcript errors in the whole transcriptome of prokaryotes ( Traverse and Ochman , 2016 ) . We further modified this protocol to minimize RNA damage potentially introduced during the preparation of sequencing libraries ( Gout et al . , 2017 ) . In this study , we applied an adapted CirSeq approach , which has been demonstrated to identify transcript errors accurately and efficiently at a large scale in eukaryotes ( Gout et al . , 2017 ) , to prokaryotes for the first time . A large number of transcript errors was detected , and transcript-error rates were revealed to be orders of magnitude higher than corresponding genetic mutation rates . Our results indicate that the bias in molecular spectra of transcript errors can be influenced by both RNA polymerases and cellular rNTP concentrations . Furthermore , the spatial distribution of transcript errors on RNAs provides novel insights into the mechanism of RNA quality-control in prokaryotes . 2 Results Applying the adapted CirSeq method ( see Materials and methods ) to E . coli , B . subtilis , A . tumefaciens , and M . florum , RNA sequencing libraries were made with three biological replicates for each species . Key steps of library preparations involve circularizing RNA fragments and generating cDNAs with tandem repeats by rolling-circle reverse transcription . In this way , transcript errors tend to appear on all repeats of sequencing reads , while sequencing and reverse transcription errors are nearly always revealed as singletons ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . The number of loci where transcript errors were identified from each species ranges from 2006 to 2942 , totaling 9929 loci across all species . M . florum showed a per-site error rate of 1 . 82±0 . 01 ( SEM ) ×10-5 , the highest among the four species ( P=0 . 009 , Mann-Whitney U test ) . The error rates in E . coli , B . subtilis , and A . tumefaciens were 5 . 84±0 . 10 ( SEM ) ×10-6 , 5 . 80±0 . 14 ( SEM ) ×10-6 , and 7 . 26±0 . 35 ( SEM ) ×10-6 , respectively . These error rates are 3 to 4 orders of magnitude higher than the corresponding genomic ( DNA-level ) mutation rates estimated from mutation-accumulation experiments in these species ( Lee et al . , 2012; Lynch et al . , 2016; Sung et al . , 2016; Sung et al . , 2015; Sung et al . , 2012 ) . With such a large number of transcript errors identified , a transcriptome-wide view of the error distribution in each species was uncovered . Based on the circular genomes of bacteria ( except for A . tumefaciens , which has one circular chromosome , one linear chromosome , and two plasmids [Goodner et al . , 2001] ) , we annotated genomic positions of transcript errors with different potential functional effects and plotted transcript-error rates in 10 kb sliding windows ( 1 kb for M . florum ) ( Figure 1 ) . To test whether transcript errors are randomly distributed across different genes , a previously proposed test ( Long et al . , 2016 ) was performed to identify genes enriched with transcript errors . For each gene , the expected number of transcript errors was calculated as the product of the average transcriptome-wide error rate per base and the sequencing coverage of the gene . The Poisson probability of observing a number of errors greater than or equal to the observed number was calculated . Out of 607 , 495 , 586 , and 186 genes with detected transcript errors in E . coli , A . tumefaciens , B . subtilis and M . florum , respectively , 1 , 4 , 0 and 4 genes were revealed to have significantly larger numbers of errors than random expectations ( Bonferroni-corrected P values of 0 . 05 , Supplementary file 1 , Tables 2-5 ) , suggesting that transcript errors are in general randomly distributed across genes . The whole bacterial transcriptome is synthesized by a single type of RNA polymerase . However , RNA products from protein-coding and noncoding RNA ( ncRNA ) regions undergo distinct co- and post-transcriptional processes . mRNAs are mature upon transcription and ready for translation , while ncRNAs , such as ribosomal RNAs ( rRNA ) and transfer RNAs ( tRNA ) , need to be further processed to be functional ( Cooper , 2000 ) . To evaluate whether transcript-error rates of these two genomic regions are different , we calculated the error rates of protein-coding and ncRNA transcripts by dividing the number of errors by the number of nucleotides assayed in corresponding regions . Transcript-error rates of these two regions are similar in E . coli and A . tumefaciens , but the error rate of ncRNA transcripts is higher than that of protein-coding transcripts in B . subtilis and lower in M . florum ( p<0 . 05 , paired t-test ) ( Figure 2 ) . A transition/transversion bias of genetic mutations has been widely observed in different species , with the molecular spectrum mostly dominated by G:C→A:T substitutions ( Hershberg and Petrov , 2010; Hildebrand et al . , 2010; Lynch , 2010 ) . However , knowledge on the molecular spectrum of transcript errors in prokaryotes remains limited ( Imashimizu et al . , 2015; Traverse and Ochman , 2016; Traverse and Ochman , 2018 ) . In this study , we calculated the error rate of all twelve categories of substitutions for each species ( Figure 3 ) , revealing a general bias of transitions over transversions . This bias has been thought to be driven solely by C→U substitutions ( Traverse and Ochman , 2016 ) , which may mainly result from post-transcriptional cytosine deaminations . However , the transition/transversion bias here even holds after C→U substitutions are excluded ( P < 0 . 005 , χ2 test , Supplementary file 1 , Table 6 ) . This observation indicates that the transcriptional machinery in bacteria , similar to the replication machinery , tends to have a low ability to distinguish rNTPs within the same structural class of nitrogenous bases ( Keightley et al . , 2009; Kucukyildirim et al . , 2016; Lee et al . , 2012; Long et al . , 2015a; Long et al . , 2015b; Lynch , 2007; Lynch , 2010; Lynch et al . , 2008; Ossowski et al . , 2010; Sung et al . , 2015 ) . Of all transitions , the C→U substitution rate is consistently high in all four species . In addition , an unexpectedly high G→A substitution rate is revealed in M . florum , which displayed the highest transcript-error rates among four species in the present study . Intriguingly , this substitution bias was also recently observed in yeast and E . coli transcription-machinery mutants with decreased fidelity ( Gout et al . , 2017; Imashimizu et al . , 2015; Traverse and Ochman , 2018 ) . Thus , the G→A substitution bias may be a signature of error-prone RNA polymerase in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes . To evaluate potential functional effects of transcript errors , we categorized transcript errors within protein-coding regions into synonymous , missense , and nonsense substitutions using SnpEff ( Cingolani et al . , 2012; Table 1 ) . Based on the bias of rNTP substitution rates ( Figure 3 ) and codon usages of each bacterium , we also calculated the expected percentages of each error type under the assumption that transcript errors are randomly generated across the genome without error-correction processes ( see Materials and methods , and Supplementary file 1 , Table 7 ) . Consistent with observations , the majority of transcript errors are expected to result in amino-acid changes , if translated ( Table 1 ) . For nonsense errors , the observed percentages are close to or significantly lower than the random expectation ( P < 0 . 005 , χ2 test , Table 1 ) . As shown in Table 1 , nonsense errors represent only a small percentage of all errors . However , they are of particular interest because they will result in the formation of a premature termination codon ( PTC ) and thus truncated proteins if not degraded . To ameliorate the potential severe fitness effects resulting from such errors , eukaryotes have evolved the Nonsense Mediated Decay ( NMD ) mechanism ( Losson and Lacroute , 1979; Maquat , 1995; Peltz et al . , 1993 ) to facilitate the degradation of RNA transcripts carrying PTCs . A key to the success of NMD is distinguishing a PTC from the original stop codon ( Amrani et al . , 2004; Le Hir et al . , 2001 ) , and the ability of the NMD machinery to identify a PTC is thought to diminish as the PTC approaches the 3′ end of a mRNA ( Isken and Maquat , 2007 ) . This hypothesis is supported by yeast transcript-error data that show a marked increase in the frequency of PTCs towards the 3′ end of mRNAs ( Gout et al . , 2017 ) . Although no analog of the eukaryotic NMD system is known in prokaryotes , a destabilizing effect of PTCs on mRNA stability has been observed in bacteria ( Arnold et al . , 1998; Braun , 1998; Morse and Yanofsky , 1969; Nilsson et al . , 1987 ) . Evaluating the distribution of nonsense errors across the whole length of mRNA transcripts , we observed an increased frequency of nonsense errors at the 3′ end of transcripts , although the trend is not statistically significant in A . tumefaciens ( Figure 4A ) . Compared to other three species , a smaller number of nonsense errors were detected in A . tumefaciens ( Supplementary file 1 , Table 7 ) , which may result in a low statistical power to reveal a potential pattern for the distribution of nonsense errors . We further modified the analysis by dividing the frequency of nonsense errors by that of all errors . This ratio tends to be higher at the 3′ end of mRNAs ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) , excluding the possibility that the enrichment of nonsense errors results mainly from a higher overall transcript-error rate at the 3′ end of mRNAs . Of all types of genetic codons , those with one nucleotide difference from a stop codon ( one-off codons ) have a higher probability of mutating into PTCs . We further normalized the frequency of nonsense errors by the abundance of one-off codons at corresponding loci . This still revealed an increased frequency of nonsense errors towards 3′ ends of transcripts ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2 ) , suggesting the higher frequency of nonsense errors is not caused by more abundant one-off codons at the 3′ end of transcripts . The increased frequency of PTCs at the 3′ end of mRNA transcripts suggests the presence of an NMD-like process , albeit by a likely different mechanism than in eukaryotes , which largely rely on the poly-A tail or exon-exon junction complex ( Amrani et al . , 2004 ) . One speculative model for the degradation of PTCs in eukaryotes , the ribosome-release model ( Brogna and Wen , 2009 ) , in which the degradation of RNAs with PTCs depends on the degree of ribosome coverage on RNA molecules , has the potential to hold true in prokaryotes . Ribosomes can load on to nascent transcripts immediately after RNA synthesis . Therefore , a whole transcript with a normal stop codon can be covered by multiple ribosomes towards its 3′ end , with these ribosomes protecting the transcript from degradation by blocking ribonuclease cleavage sites . In contrast , a PTC upstream of the original stop codon will stall the ribosomes , leaving the ribonucleotides between the PTC and the site of the original stop codon unprotected by ribosomes , potentially promoting degradation by cellular ribonucleases ( Figure 4B ) . 3 Discussion A key to accurately identifying bona fide transcript errors is to distinguish them from technical errors and low-frequency genetic mutations . With previous efforts on method development to eliminate sequencing errors ( Acevedo and Andino , 2014; Acevedo et al . , 2014; Lou et al . , 2013 ) and to evaluate the error rate of the reverse transcriptase ( Gout et al . , 2013 ) , it is now possible to ensure that contributions from such technical errors are orders of magnitudes lower than true transcript-error rates by the CirSeq approach ( See Materials and methods ) . Except for M . florum , transcript-error rates in bacteria estimated by the current study are about one order of magnitude lower than those from a previous study ( Traverse and Ochman , 2016 ) . Specifically in E . coli , our error-rate estimates for each type of substitutions tend to be lower than those from Traverse and Ochman ( 2016 ) , the most striking difference involving the C→U substitution rate , which could be partly due to the use of a metal ion-based RNA fragmentation approach in the previous work vs . enzymatic RNA fragmentation in the present study . The latter minimizes RNA damage ( Gout et al . , 2017 ) , in particular cytosine deaminations , introduced during the preparation of the sequencing library . Besides base-substitution errors , a small portion of transcript errors can occur in other forms such as insertions and deletions . Estimates of transcript insertion/deletion ( indel ) error rates from species in this study are 0 . 1 to 0 . 2 of the corresponding base-substitution error rates ( Supplementary file 1 , Table 1 ) . Bacterial transcriptomes predominantly consist of ncRNA transcripts , such as rRNAs and tRNAs ( Westermann et al . , 2012 ) . However , only a small portion of the whole ncRNA transcripts was evaluated in the present study ( Supplementary file 1 , Table 8 ) because of technical limitations . The rRNA depletion procedure in the sequencing library preparation protocol removes the majority of rRNAs . Secondary structures and nucleotide modifications of tRNAs interfere the cDNA synthesis and sequencing adapter ligations . In the future , to achieve a better measurement of transcript-error rates of ncRNA transcripts , total RNAs can be mixed with rRNA-depleted RNAs at a certain ratio to increase the abundance of rRNAs in the sequencing library . Demethylase enzymes and thermophilic reversetranscriptase can be used to remove nucleotide modifications of tRNAs and to improve processivity in generating cDNAs from highly structured RNA templates ( Schwartz et al . , 2018; Zheng et al . , 2015 ) . The molecular spectrum of transcript errors revealed in our work indicates a general C→U substitution bias , which has been proposed to be due to spontaneous deamination ( Imashimizu et al . , 2013; Traverse and Ochman , 2016 ) owing to the chemical instability of cytosine ( Alberts et al . , 2015 ) . Besides this widely accepted mechanism , non-Watson-Crick base pairing during rNTP incorporations may also contribute to this bias . Because dG and rU can form a base pair ( Sugimoto et al . , 2000; Sugimoto et al . , 1997 ) , mispairing between a template DNA ( dG ) and an RNA ( rU ) during rNTP incorporations likely also contributes to the C→U substitution bias . Another intriguing observation from the molecular spectra in the present study is the G→A substitution bias in M . florum . One source for this substitution may be unrepaired uracils on the DNA antisense strand , which pair with rATPs during transcription , resulting in a G→A substitution on the RNA transcript . Although M . florum has a diminutive genome ( 0 . 79 Mb ) and lacks many genes ( RefSeq NC_006055 . 1 ) , a uracil-DNA glycosylase ( UDG ) ortholog whose product presumably removes uracils ( McCullough et al . , 1999 ) does exist in the genome . Therefore , the extent to which mismatches between the unrepaired uracil and rATP can explain the G→A bias remains unclear . Taking data from previous studies ( Gout et al . , 2017; Imashimizu et al . , 2015; Traverse and Ochman , 2018 ) and this work together , G→A substitution bias seems to be a general pattern in cells with error-prone transcription machineries . What might be the underlying mechanism ? The error spectrum is shaped by two factors . One is the ability of an RNA polymerase to distinguish correct rNTPs from incorrect ones . The other factor , which is sometimes neglected , is the rNTP pool within a cell . The error rate of competitive binding of rNTPs to the template can be expressed as , ( kincorrect∙Cincorrect-rNTPs ) / ( kcorrect∙Ccorrect-rNTPs ) , where k refers to the rNTP incorporation rate and C indicates the concentration of rNTPs . As suggested by this equation , a biased cellular rNTP concentration might present an additional challenge to transcriptional fidelity for certain categories of rNTPs . Based on observations that RNA polymerases have a low ability to distinguish rNTPs with the same structural class of nitrogenous bases and that the cellular concentration of rATPs is the highest among all types of nucleotides in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes ( Bennett et al . , 2009; Buckstein et al . , 2008; Traut , 1994 ) , it is reasonable to speculate that the high cellular concentration of rATPs contribute to the observed bias towards G→A substitutions . An additional cellular process influencing transcript errors is RNA quality-control . Because genes involved in NMD , such as up-frameshift ( UPF ) genes , have not been identified in prokaryotes , evidence for the existence of NMD in prokaryotes is still lacking . However , previous studies based on single gene-reporters ( Baker and Mackie , 2003; Braun , 1998; Nilsson et al . , 1987 ) and our transcriptome-wide survey suggest a Nonsense-Mediated Decay-like quality-control mechanism in prokaryotes . A key implication of the increased frequency of nonsense errors at the 3′ end of mRNAs ( Figure 4A ) is that the degradation of RNAs carrying nonsense errors may simply result from a higher degree of exposure to cellular ribonucleases rather than from a reliance on specific protein-based systems . Current models of mRNA surveillance mechanisms mostly focus on stop codon-related errors ( Deutscher , 2006; Richards et al . , 2008 ) , which are expected to represent only a small portion of the total transcript errors in a cell . It is largely unknown whether , and if so by which mechanisms the major transcript errors ( missense errors ) get degraded . To resolve this , future research will be required to evaluate the rate at which transcript errors are degraded after initially being generated during transcription . This might be possible by comparing transcript errors on nascent transcripts bound to RNA polymerases with those on mature transcripts associated with ribosomes . 4 Materials and methods All bacteria strains were inoculated into liquid culture from single colonies and grew to mid-exponential growth phase upon harvest . E . coli MG1655 and B . subtilis NCIB 3610 were grown at 37°C in LB liquid medium . M . florum L1 ( ATCC #33453 ) was grown at 30°C in SNE liquid medium . A . tumefaciens C58 was grown at 28°C in LB liquid medium . Bacteria were harvested from liquid culture media by centrifugation and total RNA was extracted and purified using the FastRNA Blue Kit ( MPBiomedicals ) , RNase-free DNase set ( Qiagen ) , and the RNeasy Mini Kit ( Qiagen ) . rRNA was depleted by the Ribo-Zero rRNA Removal Kit ( Bacteria ) ( Illumina ) for the following library preparations . We followed a refined protocol of CirSeq ( Gout et al . , 2017 ) to prepare libraries for transcript error identifications . Five hundred nanograms of rRNA-depleted RNAs were firstly fragmented with the NEBNext RNase III RNA Fragmentation Module ( New England Biolabs ) for 90 min at 37°C . After a clean-up using the Oligo Clean and Concentrator kit ( Zymo Research ) , RNA fragments were circularized with RNA ligase 1 ( New England Biolabs ) according to the manufactuer’s guidelines . cDNA with tandem repeats was generated by the rolling-circle reverse transcription as described in the refined CirSeq protocol . Synthesis of the second strand of cDNA and sequencing library preparation were performed using the NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit and NEBNext Multiplex Oligos for Illumina ( New England Biolabs ) . The size selection and clean-up during sequencing library preparations were performed by Agencourt AMPure XP Beads ( Beckman Coulter ) according the NEB guideline that is optimized for approximately 200nt RNA inserts . A final gel-based size selection was performed to enrich PCR amplified products that are longer than 300nt . Single-end reads ( 300nt ) were then generated using Illumina HiSeq 2500 System . The sequencing data were deposited in NCBI with the BioProject Number PRJNA592142 . The accession numbers of genome references for E . coli , B . subtilis , and M . florum are NC_000913 . 3 , NZ_CM000488 . 1 , and NC_006055 . 1 . For A . tumefacien , accession numbers are NC_003062 . 2 , NC_003063 . 2 , NC_003064 . 2 and NC_003065 . 3 . The corresponding genome annotation files are from RefSeq . Several analysis pipelines already existed to process reads with multiple tandem repeats and call transcript errors , but with their own limitations . The CirSeq_v2 pipeline ( Acevedo and Andino , 2014; Acevedo et al . , 2014 ) can only analyze reads with exactly three repeats and reads generated by CirSeq approach can contain more than four repeats if the original RNA template is smaller than 75 nt . Another pipeline described in a recent work in yeast ( Gout et al . , 2017 ) cannot generate consensus calls and recalculate the quality score from a site where not all base calls are identical . Therefore , we developed Python scripts following the methods outlined by Lou et al . ( 2013 ) ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ) . The structure of repeats within one read was identified by an autocorrelation-based method , in which the length of one potential repeat P is detected by the maximum fraction of identical base calls that are separated by a distance P within one read . The consensus sequence was constructed and the corresponding new quality score was calculated by a Bayesian approach where an inferred consensus call is taken with the maximum posterior probability given all observed base calls . This approach also allows the processing of varied numbers and types of base calls at one site . To identify the ligation junction of circular templates and to reorganize the consensus sequence , a tandem duplicate of the consensus sequence was constructed and then mapped back to the reference genome by BWA ( Li and Durbin , 2009 ) . The longest continuous mapped regions of the duplicated consensus sequences therefore correspond to original RNA fragments . We also excluded the 4 nucleotides at both ends of the reorganized consensus sequence to minimize potential confusions , because mapping can be ambiguous at the two ends of RNA fragments . After mapping of reconstructed consensus sequences , reads uniquely mapped to protein-coding regions and all reads mapped to ncRNA regions were kept . Transcript errors were called if a mismatch between a consensus call and the reference was supported by less than 1% of reads at corresponding loci . To exclude false positives of transcript errors from genetic mutations in multiple copies of ncRNA genes ( such as rRNA and tRNA genes ) , an additional filter was included to exclude an error call that is supported by genetic variations from different copies of ncRNA genes . The transcript error rate of a given region was calculated as the number of transcript errors divided by the total number of rNTPs assayed from the corresponding region . The code for the bioinformatic pipeline can be found at https://github . com/LynchLab/CirSeq4TranscriptErrors ( Li , 2020; copy archived at https://github . com/elifesciences-publications/CirSeq4TranscriptErrors ) . First , reverse transcription and sequencing errors need to be filtered out in the analysis . Because the rate of transcript error is generally 10-6 ∼ 10-5 /nt , the recalculated probability of an erroneous base call at 10-7 or lower was required to minimize contaminations from sequencing errors . Because the error rate of the reverse transcriptase used here is ∼10-4 /nt ( Gout et al . , 2013 ) , at least two tandem repeats were required in the analysis to minimize false positives from reverse transcription errors . Second , genetic mutations ( DNA level ) can arise during cell culture and low frequency mutations can behave like transcript errors in the sequencing data . The probability of capturing a genetic mutation can be calculated by dividing the expected number of genetic mutations generated during cell propagations by the total transcriptome size at the time point of sample collection , μ⋅g⋅T⋅nT⋅n , in which µ is the per site per generation mutation rate , g is the number of generations during cell culture , T is the size of genome regions get transcribed , and n is the average expression level per site . This equation can be further simplified as µg . Because we know the mutation rate from mutation accumulation experiments ( Lee et al . , 2012; Lynch et al . , 2016; Sung et al . , 2016; Sung et al . , 2015; Sung et al . , 2012 ) and the number of generations from culture-growth dynamics ( ~30 generations ) , Low frequency genetic mutation can only inflate the transcript-error rate we calculated here by ~1‰ -1% . Take the calculation for synonymous substitution as one example . The percentage can be calculated by summing the probabilities of each codon to have a synonymous change , P ( syn ) =∑i=164Pi∙Pi ( syn ) . Pi refers to the probability of having codon i based on the codon usage of a specific genome and there are 64 codons in total . Pi ( syn ) is the probability that codon i has a synonymous substitution and it can be calculated from , Pisyn=∑j=19μj∙1j results in syn . μj denotes the substitution probability of 1 of the 9 single-base substitutions that can happen in one codon . And it can be calculated by , μj=ej∑j=19ej , in which ej refers to the error rate of 1 of the 9 substitutions in one codon . Estimates of ej are displayed in Figure 3 . The sliding window analysis ( window size = 100nt and step size = 1nt ) of the distribution of nonsense errors across mRNAs was used for data visualization . To evaluate whether or not the negative correlation between the frequency of nonsense errors and the corresponding distance from a nonsense error to the original stop codon is statistically significant , a weighted linear regression method was used . The weight was calculated as the reciprocal of a variance of a nonsense error frequency . Because the observed number of transcript errors at each locus is expected to follow a binomial distribution , the variance of the nonsense error frequency can be estimated as p ( 1-p ) n , where p is the estimated frequency of errors and n refers to the read coverage at the corresponding locus ."}

This condition , which is incurable , is characterised by the death of brain cells leading to tremors and loss of motor control . So far scientists have been able to link mutations in nearly 20 different genes to Parkinson’s disease . This includes the gene that codes for an enzyme called PINK1 . Mutations that affect PINK1 are often seen in people with early-onset Parkinson’s disease and cases that are inherited through families . Changes to PINK1 affects the ability of cells to keep producing energy . Without enough energy to power biochemical processes , affected cells will eventually die . Understanding why PINK1 has this effect and how to prevent it could be helpful in treating Parkinson’s disease . One way to understand the role of PINK1 is to study the three-dimensional structure of the protein to examine how it interacts with other molecules . The PINK1 protein from the flour beetle Tribolium castaneum is easier to produce than human PINK1; this makes it easier to study its structure in the laboratory . Using flour beetle PINK1 and a technique called X-ray crystallography , Kumar , Tamjar , Waddell et al . made a detailed three-dimensional model of the structure of the PINK1 protein . This revealed new details of the structure including a region at one end called the “C-terminal extension” , which is involved in PINK1’s enzyme activities . The structure also highlighted the purposes of two loop regions , one that controls PINK1 activity and one that affects its interactions with other proteins . Further examination of some of these features showed that they are also part of human PINK1 proteins . Using this new protein structure , Kumar et al . went on to examine 20 mutations that are found in patients with Parkinson’s disease and have been able to show the effect that these changes have on PINK1 at a molecular level . It may now be possible to begin designing drugs to prevent or reverse these changes , which could lead to new treatments for Parkinson’s disease .", "article": "1 Introduction Autosomal recessive inherited loss-of-function mutations in human PTEN-induced kinase 1 ( hPINK1 ) , represent the second most frequent cause of early-onset Parkinson’s disease ( PD ) ( Valente et al . , 2004 ) . hPINK1 has been proposed to act as a master regulator of mitochondrial quality control , promoting the elimination of damaged mitochondria via autophagy known as mitophagy ( McWilliams and Muqit , 2017 ) . In response to mitochondrial depolarisation , hPINK1 is activated and phosphorylates ubiquitin at Serine65 ( Ser65 ) . Ser65-phosphorylated ubiquitin then binds to the ubiquitin E3 ligase Parkin with high affinity , serving to prime Parkin for phosphorylation by hPINK1 at an equivalent Ser65 residue that lies within its N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain ( Ubl ) ( Kondapalli et al . , 2012; Kazlauskaite et al . , 2014; Kane et al . , 2014; Koyano et al . , 2014 ) . This chain of phosphorylation events stimulates maximal activation of Parkin E3 ligase activity , resulting in ubiquitylation of multiple substrates at the outer mitochondrial membrane and represents a critical upstream step in the induction of mitophagy ( McWilliams and Muqit , 2017 ) . The molecular mechanisms of hPINK1 activation and substrate recognition are poorly understood . hPINK1 is distinct from other protein kinases due to the presence of three unique insertions ( Ins1 , Ins2 and Ins3 ) within the kinase domain and a C-terminal extension ( CTE ) of unknown function that bears no homology to any known protein domain ( Figure 1A ) . Nearly , 30 missense and nonsense hPINK1 mutations have been reported in patients worldwide ( Deas et al . , 2009 ) , located predominantly within the kinase domain or predicted to truncate the CTE . However , the molecular mechanism by which they disrupt hPINK1 catalysis and/or recognition of its physiological substrates ubiquitin and Parkin is unknown . We have previously identified a hPINK1 orthologue in Tribolium castaneum ( TcPINK1 ) , which in contrast to human hPINK1 , almost entirely lacks the first kinase domain insertion ( Woodroof et al . , 2011 ) ( Figure 1A ) . TcPINK1 exhibits constitutive catalytic activity towards ubiquitin , Parkin and generic substrates in vitro ( Woodroof et al . , 2011; Kazlauskaite et al . , 2015 ) . Furthermore , the motor defects of Drosophila PINK1 null flies can be efficiently rescued in vivo by crossing lines that over-express TcPINK1 ( Woodroof et al . , 2011 ) . Herein , we report the crystal structure of TcPINK1 , revealing structural insights into the CTE and kinase domain loop insertions . In particular , we show that the third insertion contributes to formation of a bowl-shaped binding site for ubiquitin that is critical for either TcPINK1 or hPINK1 mediated ubiquitin and Parkin Ubl phosphorylation . Furthermore , we have elaborated an important regulatory role for TcPINK1 autophosphorylation of Serine205 ( Ser205 ) , which together with the third insertion , aids in physiological substrate recognition . Overall , these findings provide molecular insights into the mechanisms of hPINK1 kinase activity , ubiquitin substrate recognition , and define the molecular basis of Parkinson’s disease-causing mutations . 2 Results and discussion The crystal structure of a catalytically active fragment of TcPINK1 was solved and refined to 2 . 78 Å using E . coli expression of a cDNA construct encompassing the kinase domain and CTE ( Ser150 - Asp570 ) , and possessing mutations to reduce surface entropy ( Glu527Ala and Lys528Ala ) , a 10 amino acid deletion in a large loop ( Δ261–270 ) , and a phospho-mimetic mutation ( Ser205Glu ) ( Figure 1A ) . The crystal structure of TcPINK1 reveals core secondary structure elements of a typical protein kinase domain ( Hanks and Hunter , 1995 ) ( Figure 1B , C ) . As described previously ( Woodroof et al . , 2011 ) , the N-lobe of the TcPINK1 kinase domain contains three insertions: Lys182–Pro192 ( Ins1 ) , Glu221–Ala253 ( Ins2 ) , and Leu260–Met288 ( Ins3 ) and in contrast to hPINK1 , Ins1 exists as a loop remnant in TcPINK1 ( Figure 1A , B ) . Ins2 forms a small domain containing a βi-strand ( 222-226 ) and an αi-helix ( 231-242 ) followed by a loop ( 243-253 ) . Ins3 is disordered and is not included in the final model ( Figure 1B , C ) . Finally , the majority of the TcPINK1 CTE ( Ala487–Leu556 ) is α-helical in nature ( Figure 1B , C ) , and rather than forming a separate domain , is tightly packed on the E , G and H α-helices of the C-lobe of the kinase domain ( 3747 Å2 buried surface area ) , supporting previous data on the importance of this region for catalysis ( Woodroof et al . , 2011 ) . A DALI structure similarity search revealed that Ins2 and the CTE structural elements are unique to TcPINK1 and not found in the almost thousand kinase structures solved to date . Although TcPINK1 was crystallised without ATP , the kinase domain appears to adopt an active , closed conformation , based on the positioning of the αC helix , activation segment conformation , and the ‘in’ position of the DFG motif ( Hari et al . , 2013; Huse and Kuriyan , 2002; Nolen et al . , 2004 ) ( Figure 1B ) . A model of the ATP was included by superposition with the conformationally similar cAMP dependent protein kinase-ATP complex ( RMSD 3 . 2 Å on 252 equivalent Cα atoms ) . This suggested that residues Ala194 , Lys196 , Leu344 , Tyr297 and Glu217 are critical for ATP binding ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1A ) . In agreement with this , biochemical analysis revealed that the Ala194Asp , Lys196Ala and Glu217Lys TcPINK1 mutants prevented phosphorylation of its physiological substrates , ubiquitin and the Parkin Ubl domain ( Figure 1D , Figure 1—figure supplement 1B ) . Furthermore , inspection of the structure indicates that the conformation of residues forming two conserved hydrophobic networks ( the ‘R-spine’ comprising residues Ile253 , Val219 , Phe360 , His335 and Asp410 , and the ‘C-spine’ residues Val176 , Leu301 , Leu343 , Leu344 , Leu345 , ILe421 and Ile417 ) is compatible with an active conformation ( Kornev et al . , 2006 , 2008 ) . hPINK1-dependent phosphorylation of Ser65 on ubiquitin and the Ubl domain of Parkin is critical for maximal Parkin activation ( Wauer et al . , 2015; Kumar et al . , 2017 ) . However , the regions of hPINK1 that recognize and bind its substrates remain unknown . Via DALI structure similarity search , we identified the LIM kinase-cofilin complex ( Hamill et al . , 2016 ) as being conformationally similar to TcPINK1 ( RMSD 2 . 8 Å on 298 equivalenced Cα atoms ) . Using the phosphopeptide in this complex as an anchor ( Figure 2A ) , we superimposed Ser65 of ubiquitin onto the TcPINK1 active site , resulting in a model of the TcPINK1-ubiquitin complex , free of steric clashes ( Figure 2B ) . Using this model , we explored the key structural elements in TcPINK1 that may contribute to recognition of ubiquitin . Although Ins3 in the TcPINK1 kinase domain is mostly disordered and could not be built as part of the structure; its predicted location places it proximal to the ubiquitin in the model of the complex and therefore we hypothesized that it is likely to contribute a critical role towards substrate recognition and binding . To test this , we deleted 10 residues ( residues 261–270 , equivalent to the deletion used in the crystallisation construct ) of Ins3 and measured TcPINK1 catalytic activity using multiple physiological readouts , including TcPINK1 catalysed phosphorylation of ubiquitin and the Parkin Ubl domain , and transphosphorylation of a kinase-inactive ( D359A ) TcPINK1 fragment ( residues 125–570; His-SUMO cleaved ) ( Figure 2C , D , Figure 2—figure supplement 1A ) . Strikingly , deletion of Ins3 resulted in complete loss of ubiquitin or Parkin Ubl phosphorylation , while preserving transphosphorylation activity towards kinase-inactive TcPINK1 ( Figure 2C , D , Figure 2—figure supplement 1A ) . We also found that mutation of key residues Leu371 , Tyr375 , Lys382 and Lys435 within the canonical substrate binding pocket of kinases resulted in loss of activity against ubiquitin ( Figure 2B , Figure 2—figure supplement 1B ) . We have previously identified multiple autophosphorylation sites for TcPINK1 by mass spectrometry , including Ser205 ( equivalent to Ser228 in hPINK1 ) and Ser207 ( equivalent to Ser230 in hPINK1 ) ( Woodroof et al . , 2011 ) . Ser207 phosphorylation was also observed in the crystal structure ( Figure 2B ) . Inspection of the structure revealed that Glu205 ( the phosphomimetic of Ser205 ) lies only 4 Å away from the tail ( Asn287 ) of the disordered Ins3 ( Figure 2B ) . We therefore hypothesized that autophosphorylation of Ser205 may influence and/or contribute to ubiquitin recognition and binding mediated by Ins3 . Therefore , to test the effect of Ser205 phosphorylation in substrate recognition , we performed parallel assays with ubiquitin , Parkin Ubl domain and transphosphorylation of kinase-inactive TcPINK1 as performed for the Ins3 deletion . Critically Ser205Ala , but not Ser207Ala , prevented ubiquitin and Parkin Ubl phosphorylation while preserving transphosphorylation activity towards kinase-inactive TcPINK1 ( Figure 2C , D , Figure 2—figure supplement 1A ) . Overall , these findings indicate that Ins3 , unique to the PINK1 kinases , together with autophosphorylation at Ser205 , is critical for ubiquitin and Parkin Ubl phosphorylation and may form part of the ubiquitin/Ubl fold recognition pocket . Multiple lines of evidence suggest that hPINK1 is autoinhibited under basal conditions , including lack of significant activity of hPINK1 in vitro ( Woodroof et al . , 2011 ) and the detection of robust activity of hPINK1 in cells only under conditions of mitochondrial depolarization triggering hPINK1 activation via an unknown mechanism ( Kondapalli et al . , 2012 ) . In contrast to hPINK1 , insect orthologues isolated from Drosophila melanogaster , Pediculus humanus corporis and Tribolium castaneum exhibit constitutive catalytic activity in vitro ( Woodroof et al . , 2011; Wauer et al . , 2015 ) . Since the TcPINK1 kinase domain adopts an active conformation in our crystal structure , we sought to exploit this knowledge to probe possible mechanisms of hPINK1 activation . Activation loop phosphorylation is the most common mechanism of protein kinase activation ( Hanks and Hunter , 1995 ) , with phosphorylation stabilising the active conformation via electrostatic interaction between the phospho-serine/threonine residue and a basic pocket consisting of the arginine in the HRD motif ( Nolen et al . , 2004 ) . Previous mass spectrometry analysis of TcPINK1 did not identify activation loop phosphorylation , and furthermore , alanine mutation of a candidate T-loop phosphorylation site residue , Ser377 , did not impair TcPINK1 catalytic activity ( Woodroof et al . , 2011 ) . Consistent with this , we do not observe phosphorylation of Ser377 in the TcPINK1 structure and furthermore , Ser377 is located too distant ( 12 . 2 Å ) from Arg336 of the HRD motif to form an electrostatic interaction ( Figure 3A ) . Instead the TcPINK1 structure reveals that a highly conserved aspartate ( Asp381 ) within the activation loop , an arginine residue ( Arg336 ) of the HRD motif and an arginine residue ( Arg216 ) in the αC-helix , form an equivalent interaction ( Figure 3A ) , which is further stabilized via interaction with basic residues ( Lys212 on the αC-helix; Arg240 and Arg241 in Ins2 ) and another conserved aspartate ( Asp366 ) . To explore which residues were important for TcPINK1 catalysed phosphorylation of its substrates , we investigated point mutants of residues lying within this region . The Asp366Ala TcPINK1 mutant was unstable under our expression conditions and was not assessed . Importantly , our data revealed that mutants in this region , particularly the Asp381Ala and Arg240Ala mutants , were associated with a significant reduction in TcPINK1 catalytic kinase activity towards ubiquitin ( Figure 3B ) . Although Asp381 and Asp366 are conserved in hPINK1 , Lys212 and Arg216 form a basic patch on the αC-helix that is conserved among the insect orthologues but not in hPINK1 , where the equivalent residues are Asn235 and Gln239 . Furthermore , Arg240 and Arg241 of TcPINK1 are replaced by Gly264 and Pro265 in hPINK1 , respectively ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1A ) . We hypothesized that these differences in basic residues between TcPINK1 and hPINK1 could explain the lack of recombinant hPINK1 activity . To test this , we generated a mutant of hPINK1 incorporating Asn235Lys/Gln239Arg/Gly264Arg/Pro265Arg substitutions , however , this did not lead to any significant enhancement in hPINK1 activity ( data not shown ) . Inspection of the TcPINK1 structure suggests another potential regulatory mechanism of activation through interaction of Ins2 with the αC-helix ( 1120 Å2 buried surface area ) ( Figure 3C ) . This interaction is reminiscent of the activation mechanism of cyclin dependent kinases ( CDKs ) , whereby intermolecular stabilization of the CDK αC-helix occurs due to interactions with the cyclin α5-helix ( Figure 3C ) ( Jeffrey et al . , 1995 ) . The TcPINK1 αi-helix ( residues 231–242 ) of Ins2 ( residues 221–253 ) occupies a similar position to cyclin , inducing a displacement of the αC-helix and allowing formation of the key salt bridge between the conserved Glu217 on the αC-helix and the conserved Lys196 on the N-lobe , maintaining the kinase in an active conformation ( Figure 3C ) . Akin to the intermolecular CDK-cyclin interaction , the TcPINK1 αC-helix-αi-helix intramolecular interface also consists of hydrophobic interactions ( Figure 3C ) . Whilst the overall conservation of Ins2 ( residues 221–253 ) is low , the C-terminal/distal region ( 243-253 ) of Ins2 remains highly conserved ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1A ) , forming a loop ( Ins2 loop ) which tethers the proximal region of Ins2 ( βi-strand and αi-helix ) with the rest of the C-lobe mediated by interactions between His247 and Asn249 of Ins2 and Ser545 of CTE and Gln320 of the C-lobe , respectively . Furthermore , a hydrophobic core is formed between Leu244 and Ile250 of Ins2 with Phe360 of the ‘DFG motif’ and Ile357 ( Figure 3C ) . Interestingly , deletion of the αi-helix ( residues 231–242 ) alone or in combination with the βi-strand ( residues 222–242 ) region of Ins2 does not affect the catalytic activity of TcPINK1 . However , deletion of the Ins2 loop ( residues 243–253 ) abolishes the kinase activity of TcPINK1 ( Figure 3D , Figure 3—figure supplement 1B ) . Therefore , our analysis suggests a critical role for the Ins2 loop ( 243-253 ) as an anchor , to maintaining the kinase domain in an active state , although the function of the proximal region of Ins2 ( 222-242 ) remains to be fully elucidated . Sequence alignment of hPINK1 and TcPINK1 reveals an overall high degree of conservation with the exception of the relative absence of Ins1 in TcPINK1 ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) . Therefore , we next explored the structural and functional conservation between insect and human PINK1 in cells expressing hPINK1 whose kinase activity can be stimulated by carbonyl cyanide m-cholorophenylhydrazone ( CCCP ) that induces mitochondrial depolarization ( Kazlauskaite et al . , 2015 ) . We transiently expressed wild type hPINK1 or mutants of key ATP-binding residues predicted from the TcPINK1 structure ( Figure 1D , Figure 1—figure supplement 1A ) into HeLa hPINK1 knockout cells generated by TALEN technology ( Narendra et al . , 2013 ) . Cells were treated with 10 μM CCCP or DMSO for 3 hr and extracts immunoblotted with phospho-specific antibodies raised against hPINK1 substrates Ser65 Parkin and Ser65 ubiquitin . Consistent with our analysis of TcPINK1 ( Figure 1D ) , we found that Parkin and ubiquitin phosphorylation was abolished in cells expressing mutant A217D , K219A , E240K and L369P forms of hPINK1 upon CCCP stimulation ( Figure 4A ) . This indicates that the ATP-binding pocket is well conserved between TcPINK1 and hPINK1 . We next explored whether Ins3 , which is well conserved between TcPINK1 and higher species , is critical for ubiquitin and Parkin Ubl recognition by hPINK1 . Consistent with TcPINK1 , we observed abrogation of phosphorylation of ubiquitin and Parkin in cells expressing hPINK1 harbouring a deletion of Ins3 ( Δ285–294 – corresponding to deletion in TcPINK1 Δ261–270 ) in striking contrast to cells expressing hPINK1 containing a deletion in Ins1 ( Δ180–209 ) or a deletion in the proximal region of Ins2 ( Δ245–265 - corresponding to βi-strand and αi-helix of TcPINK1 ) . Overall , these findings indicate that hPINK1 and TcPINK1 share similar mechanisms for substrate recognition and kinase activity , suggesting that the TcPINK1 structure will provide an important framework to direct future studies aimed at structural studies of the hPINK1 enzyme . Mutations in hPINK1 are a leading cause of familial early-onset PD and whilst previous studies have demonstrated that mutations disrupt hPINK1-dependent activity and mitophagy in cells ( McWilliams and Muqit , 2017; Deas et al . , 2009 ) , very little is known about how these impact hPINK1 structure . Of the approximately thirty reported homozygous or compound heterozygous pathogenic mutations ( Deas et al . , 2009 ) , twenty are conserved in TcPINK1 ( Supplementary file 1 ) . Mapping of these pathogenic mutations onto the structure of TcPINK1 ( Figure 5 , Supplementary file 1 ) , reveals that they cluster within functionally distinct regions of hPINK1 . A major group of PD-associated mutations lie within the ATP-binding pocket including Ala217Asp , Glu240Lys , Ala244Gly and Leu369Pro and perturb interactions with ATP . A second group of mutations that lie in the catalytic motif or activation loop include Gly386Ala , Pro416Arg/Leu and Glu417Gly ( Figure 5A , C ) result in catalytically inactive hPINK1 ( Deas et al . , 2009 ) . The His271Gln mutation lies within the critical distal Ins2 loop of hPINK1 ( Figure 5A , C ) , that anchors the proximal Ins2 to the C-lobe ( Figure 3C ) , and has previously been found to abolish catalytic activity in vitro ( Woodroof et al . , 2011 ) as well as hPINK1 activity in cells ( Okatsu et al . , 2012 ) . In contrast , the Gly309Asp ( G309D ) PD mutation located within Ins3 ( Figure 2 ) would be predicted to perturb hPINK1 and substrate ( ubiquitin/Ubl domain of Parkin ) interaction as our analysis suggests that Ins3 is required for ubiquitin phosphorylation ( Figure 2C , Figure 2—figure supplement 1A ) . Consistent with this , a previous study showed that the G309D hPINK1 mutant fails to phosphorylate Parkin Ubl in cells ( Iguchi et al . , 2013 ) whereas the equivalent TcPINK1 G285D mutant continues to exhibit catalytic activity towards generic and peptide substrates in vitro ( Woodroof et al . , 2011 ) . The remainder of mutations mainly affects residues critical for structural integrity of hPINK1 . In particular , the CTE of TcPINK1 forms a hydrophobic core against the E , G and H helices of the C-lobe ( Figure 5B ) , and a cluster of PD mutations in hPINK1 including Leu539Phe , Leu347Pro and Leu489Pro located in this vicinity suggest the importance of this hydrophobic core ( Figure 5B ) . Attempts to purify soluble protein for a number of point mutants targeting this hydrophobic interface were unsuccessful , underscoring the importance of this hydrophobic core which explains loss of kinase activity of TcPINK1 upon CTE deletion in previous studies ( Woodroof et al . , 2011 ) . Although it has previously been suggested that CTE may be important for dimerization ( Okatsu et al . , 2013 ) , we did not find evidence for a functional dimer in our TcPINK1 purification procedures or crystal structure . Overall the TcPINK1 structure provides molecular insights into the structural regulation of hPINK1 and in particular defines functional roles for its unique loop insertions in ubiquitin substrate recognition and catalytic activity . The structure provides clarity on the impact of loss of function disease-associated mutations , which may stimulate future drug discovery efforts for both familial and idiopathic PD . 3 Materials and methods BL21 codon plus ( DES ) RIPL ( Stratagene ) were transformed with pET15 6HIS SUMO TcPINK1S150-D570 ΔI261-L270 S205E E527A K528A ( available from MRC PPU Reagents and Services: http://mrcppureagents . dundee . ac . uk ) . For overexpression , 1 L of Terrific broth ( TB ) medium was inoculated with 10 ml of overnight culture . Cultures were propagated in a shaking incubator ( Infors HT ) at 37°C and 200 rpm until OD600 ~0 . 6–0 . 8 . Temperature was then reduced to 16°C upon which cultures were supplemented with 100 µM IPTG and grown overnight . Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 25 min ( Beckman coulter J6-Mi centrifuge ) . Cell pellets were carefully resuspended in ~4 × cell volume of lysis buffer ( 50 mM EPPS pH 8 . 6 , 500 mM NaCl , 5% glycerol , 3% sucrose , 5 mM imidazole ) at 12°C by gentle shaking ( 150 rpm ) . Before lysis , 0 . 5 mM TCEP pH 7 . 5 ( from Apollo Scientific , United Kingdom ) , 0 . 1 mM Pefabloc ( Sigma Aldrich , United Kingdom ) , and 10 µM Leupeptin ( Apollo Scientific ) were added to the mixture . Cells were then lysed by sonication ( 6 × 10 s pulses at 10 s intervals , 45% amplitude ) and to remove the cell debris , the cell lysates were centrifuged at 28 , 000 rpm for 25 min at 4°C ( Beckman Avanti J-30 I centrifuge ) . For protein purification , the supernatant was incubated with Nickel sepharose beads previously equilibrated with 10 CV binding buffer ( 50 mM EPPS pH 8 . 6 , 500 mM NaCl , 5% glycerol , 3% sucrose , 5 mM imidazole , 0 . 5 mM TCEP , pH 7 . 5 ) for 1 hr at 4°C on a roller . Thereafter , the beads were collected by filtration and washed thoroughly ( 800 ml −1 L ) with binding buffer containing 30 mM imidazole . The protein was then eluted from the beads using the elution buffer ( 50 mM EPPS pH 8 . 6 , 500 mM NaCl , 5% glycerol , 3% sucrose , 400 mM imidazole , 0 . 5 mM TCEP , pH 7 . 5 ) . The eluted protein was mixed with His-SENP1 protease ( 1 mg of His-SENP1 per 25 mg of TcPINK1 ) to cleave off the SUMO tag and dialyzed into 30 mM HEPES pH 7 . 5 , 500 mM NaCl , 5% glycerol , 3% sucrose , 0 . 25 mM TCEP , pH 7 . 5 at 4°C overnight ( using 3 . 5 kDa SnakeSkin dialysis tubing; Thermo Fisher ) . The dialyzed mixture was subjected to negative pull down using Nickel sepharose resin to remove the His-SUMO and TcPINK1 was concentrated to ~5 ml . Reductive methylation of lysine residues was then performed ( as described in Hampton Research Protocols ) before loading onto a gel filtration column ( HiLoad Superdex 16/600 , GE Healthcare ) , previously equilibrated with the gel filtration buffer ( 25 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 5 , 300 mM NaCl , 5% glycerol , 3% sucrose , 2 mM TCEP , pH 7 . 5 ) . Following gel filtration , methylated TcPINK1 was concentrated to 9 mg/ml flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C for further use . For overexpression , purification and methylation of selenomethionine ( SeMet ) TcPINK1 derivatives , an identical protocol was used ( using MD12-500 kit from Molecular Dimensions to incorporate selenomethionine ) . Native and selenomethionine derivatised TcPINK1 was crystallised using 5 mg/ml of protein mixing with 200 mM MgCl2 , 100 mM HEPES pH 7 . 0 , 20% PEG 6000 and 200 mM MgCl2 or 100 mM HEPES pH 7 . 5 , 25% PEG 3350 and 200 mM MgCl2 , respectively , under vapor diffusion sitting drop method . Crystals were flash frozen using 20% of glycerol with mother liquor . Data were collected at ESRF , with a SeMet anomalous data set collected at the selenium absorption edge . Selenomethionine-incorporated and native crystals diffracted to 3 . 4 Å and 2 . 8 Å , respectively . Data were processed using XDS ( Kabsch , 2014 ) and AIMLESS ( Winn et al . , 2011 ) . SAD phasing was performed on the anomalous data set using CRANK2 in the CCP4 program suite . Phases were improved by iterative cycles of manual model building and refinement using Coot ( Emsley and Cowtan , 2004 ) and Refmac ( Winn et al . , 2011 ) , respectively ( Table 1 ) . Ramachandran values were calculated using MolProbity ( Chen et al . , 2010 ) with 94% of residues in the most favored regions . Full length wild-type and mutant TcPINK1 were expressed in E . coli ( BL21-codonplus ) as maltose-binding protein fusion proteins .

In the highly diversified insect order Lepidoptera , male PRs tuned to female-emitted type I pheromones ( which make up the vast majority of pheromones identified ) form a dedicated subfamily of odorant receptors ( ORs ) . Here , using a combination of heterologous expression and in vivo genome editing methods , we bring functional evidence that at least one moth PR does not belong to this subfamily but to a distantly related OR lineage . This PR , identified in the cotton leafworm Spodoptera littoralis , is highly expressed in male antennae and is specifically tuned to the major sex pheromone component emitted by females . Together with a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of moth ORs , our functional data suggest two independent apparitions of PRs tuned to type I pheromones in Lepidoptera , opening up a new path for studying the evolution of moth pheromone communication .", "plain language summary": "Many animals make use of chemical signals to communicate with other members of their species . Such chemical signals , called pheromones , often allow males and females of the same species to recognize each other before mating . Since the discovery of the very first pheromone in the silkworm moth Bombyx mori at the end of the 1950s , moths have been a model for pheromone research . The sex pheromone communication system in these insects has thus been well described: females emit a mixture of volatile chemicals , which can be detected by the antennae of males up to several hundred meters away . This detection is achieved through neurons with specialized proteins known as pheromone receptors that bind to the chemical signals produced by the females . Recognizing mates by detecting a very specific pheromone signature prevents moths from interbreeding with other species . The evolution of pheromone signals and their corresponding receptors can therefore lead to the rise of new reproductive barriers between populations , and eventually to the emergence of new species . The rate at which sex pheromones have diversified is likely one reason for the existence of over 160 , 000 species of moths . But how did moths’ sex pheromone receptors evolve in the first place ? Previous studies suggested that moth pheromone receptors had appeared just once during evolution . Specifically , they revealed that these receptors belong to the same branch or lineage in the ‘family tree’ of all receptors that detect chemical compounds in moths . This meant that when researchers looked for pheromone receptors in a new species of moth , they always focused on this lineage . But Bastin-Héline et al . have now found that one pheromone receptor from a pest moth called Spodoptera littoralis does not belong to this established group . First , Bastin-Héline et al . inserted this receptor into animal cells grown in the laboratory to confirm that it responds to a specific pheromone produced by S . littoralis . Next , they genetically modified moths of this species and showed that males need this receptor in order to mate . An evolutionary analysis showed that the receptor belongs to a different lineage than all the other known pheromone receptors . Together these results indicate the receptors for sex pheromones must have evolved multiple times independently in moths . These results will open new avenues for deciphering pheromone communication in moths , and lead to further research into this newly discovered lineage of candidate pheromone receptors . Such studies may foster the development of new strategies to control agricultural pests , given that some species of moths can have devastating effects on the yields of certain crops .", "article": "1 Introduction The use of pheromone signals for mate recognition is widespread in animals , and changes in sex pheromone communication are expected to play a major role in the rise of reproductive barriers and the emergence of new species ( Smadja and Butlin , 2009 ) . Since the first chemical identification of such a pheromone in Bombyx mori ( Butenandt et al . , 1959 ) , moths ( Insecta , Lepidoptera ) have been a preferred taxon for pheromone research ( Cardé and Haynes , 2004; Kaissling , 2014 ) . The diversification of pheromone signals has likely played a prominent role in the extensive radiation observed in Lepidoptera , which represents almost 10% of the total described species of living organisms ( Stork , 2018 ) . Female moths generally release a species-specific blend of volatile molecules , which attract males over a long distance ( Cardé and Haynes , 2004 ) . Four types of sex pheromones have been described in moths ( types 0 , I , II and III ) , with distinct chemical structures and biosynthetic pathways ( Löfstedt et al . , 2016 ) . 75% of all known moth sex pheromone compounds belong to type I and are straight-chain acetates , alcohols or aldehydes with 10 to 18 carbon atoms ( Ando et al . , 2004 ) . Type I pheromones have been found in most moth families investigated , whereas the other types are restricted to only a few families ( Löfstedt et al . , 2016 ) . In moth male antennae , pheromone compounds are detected by dedicated populations of olfactory sensory neurons ( OSNs ) . Each type of OSN usually expresses one pheromone receptor ( PR ) responsible for signal transduction . PRs are 7-transmembrane domain proteins belonging to the odorant receptor ( OR ) family and , as ORs , are co-expressed in OSNs together with the conserved co-receptor Orco ( Chertemps , 2017; Fleischer and Krieger , 2018 ) . Since the first discovery of moth PRs ( Krieger et al . , 2004; Sakurai et al . , 2004 ) , numerous pheromone receptors tuned to type I pheromone compounds have been characterized through different hererologous expression systems , and most appeared to be specific to only one compound ( Zhang and Löfstedt , 2015 ) . More recently , a few receptors tuned to type 0 and type II pheromones have also been characterized ( Zhang et al . , 2016; Yuvaraj et al . , 2017 ) . Type I PRs belong to a dedicated monophyletic subfamily of ORs , the so-called ‘PR clade’ , suggesting a unique emergence early in the evolution of Lepidoptera ( Yuvaraj et al . , 2018 ) . Another hallmark of type I PRs is their male-biased expression ( Koenig et al . , 2015 ) . The phylogenetic position and the expression pattern have thus been the main criteria used to select candidate PRs for functional studies . Likewise , we selected PRs from the male transcriptome of the cotton leafworm Spodoptera littoralis ( Legeai et al . , 2011 ) , a polyphagous crop pest that uses type I sex pheromone compounds ( Muñoz et al . , 2008 ) and that has been established as a model in insect chemical ecology ( Ljungberg et al . , 1993; Binyameen et al . , 2012; Saveer et al . , 2012; Poivet et al . , 2012; de Fouchier et al . , 2017 ) . Through heterologous expression , we characterized two PRs tuned to minor components of the S . littoralis pheromone blend ( Montagné et al . , 2012; de Fouchier et al . , 2015 ) , but none of the tested candidate PRs detected the major pheromone component ( Z , E ) -9 , 11-tetradecadienyl acetate ( hereafter referred as ( Z , E ) -9 , 11-14:OAc ) , which is necessary and sufficient to elicit all steps of the male mate-seeking behavioral sequence ( Quero et al . , 1996 ) . In order to identify new type I PR candidates , we focused on male-biased ORs , whether they belong to the PR clade or not . Notably , a preliminary analysis of S . littoralis OR expression patterns led to the identification of such a receptor , SlitOR5 , which was highly expressed in male antennae but did not belong to the PR clade ( Legeai et al . , 2011 ) . Furthermore , a recent RNAseq analysis showed that SlitOR5 was the most abundant OR in S . littoralis male antennae ( Walker et al . , 2019 ) . Here , we demonstrate that SlitOR5 is the receptor for ( Z , E ) -9 , 11-14:OAc using a combination of heterologous expression and in vivo genome editing methods . Based on a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of lepidopteran ORs , we show that SlitOR5 belongs to an OR subfamily that is distantly related to the PR clade but harbors numerous sex-biased ORs from distinct moth families . Altogether , these results suggest that PRs detecting type I pheromones evolved at least twice in Lepidoptera , which offers a more detailed and complex panorama on moth PR evolution . 2 Results We first used quantitative real-time PCR to compare the relative expression levels of the SlitOr5 gene in S . littoralis male and female adult antennae . We found SlitOr5 expressed with a more than 50-fold enrichment in the male antennae ( Figure 1A ) , thus confirming previous observations ( Legeai et al . , 2011; Walker et al . , 2019 ) . We reconstructed a maximum likelihood phylogeny of lepidopteran ORs , based on entire OR repertoires from nine different species . Among the 20 paralogous lineages identified ( each having evolved in principle from an ancestral OR present in the last common ancestor of Lepidoptera ) , SlitOR5 belonged to a lineage distantly related to the type I PR clade , as well as to the lineages containing type 0 and type II PRs ( Figure 1B ) . These four paralogous lineages grouped within a larger clade highly supported by the bootstrap analysis ( highlighted in grey in Figure 1B ) . This clade has been previously shown to contain ORs tuned to terpenes and aliphatic molecules – including sex pheromones – and exhibits higher evolutionary rates compared to more ancient clades that contain many receptors for aromatics ( de Fouchier et al . , 2017 ) . We next used two complementary heterologous systems to characterize the function of SlitOR5 and assess whether it is the receptor to ( Z , E ) -9 , 11-14:OAc , the major component of the S . littoralis sex pheromone blend . First , we expressed SlitOR5 in Drosophila melanogaster OSNs housed in at1 trichoid sensilla , in place of the endogenous PR DmelOR67d ( Kurtovic et al . , 2007 ) . Single-sensillum recordings were performed to measure the response of at1 OSNs to 26 type I pheromone compounds ( Supplementary file 1 ) , including all the components identified in the pheromones of Spodoptera species ( El-Sayed , 2018 ) . SlitOR5-expressing OSNs strongly responded to ( Z , E ) -9 , 11-14:OAc ( 65 ± 15 spikes . s−1 ) , whereas there was no significant response to any other compound ( Figure 2A ) . Then , we co-expressed SlitOR5 with its co-receptor SlitOrco in Xenopus oocytes and recorded the responses to the same panel of pheromone compounds using two-electrode voltage-clamp . A strong current was induced in SlitOR5-expressing oocytes when stimulated with ( Z , E ) -9 , 11-14:OAc ( 3 . 9 ± 0 . 3 µA ) , whereas only minor currents were recorded in response to ( Z , E ) -9 , 12-14:OAc and ( Z ) 9-12:OAc ( Figure 2B ) . SlitOR5 sensitivity was assessed with a dose-response experiment that showed a low detection threshold ( 10−8 M ) and an EC50 of 1 . 707 × 10−7 M ( Figure 2D–E ) . We compared the response spectra of heterologously expressed SlitOR5 with that of S . littoralis male OSNs housed in type one long trichoid sensilla ( LT1A OSNs , Figure 2C ) , known to detect ( Z , E ) -9 , 11-14:OAc ( Ljungberg et al . , 1993; Quero et al . , 1996 ) . When stimulated with the 26 pheromone compounds , LT1A OSNs significantly responded to ( Z , E ) -9 , 11-14:OAc ( 55 ± 4 spikes . s−1 ) and to a lesser extent to its stereoisomer ( Z , Z ) -9 , 11-14:OAc , which is absent from any Spodoptera pheromone . This mirrored the response spectra of heterologously expressed SlitOR5 , especially the one observed in Drosophila OSNs ( Figure 2A ) . To confirm in vivo that SlitOR5 is the receptor for the major sex pheromone component of S . littoralis , we carried out a loss-of-function study by generating mutant insects for the gene SlitOr5 . The CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system was used to create a mutation in the first exon of SlitOr5 with the aim of disrupting the open-reading frame . Guide RNAs were injected along with the Cas9 protein in more than one thousand eggs . We genotyped 66 G0 hatched larvae and found seven individuals carrying at least one mutation in SlitOr5 . These 7 G0 individuals were back-crossed with wild-type individuals to create 7 G1 heterozygous mutant lines . We selected a line carrying a single mutation that consisted of a 10 bp deletion at the expected location , introducing a premature STOP codon within the SlitOr5 transcript after 247 codons ( Figure 3A ) . We next generated G2 homozygous mutant males ( SlitOr5-/- ) and compared their ability to detect ( Z , E ) -9 , 11-14:OAc to that of wild-type and heterozygous ( SlitOr5+/- ) males , using electroantennogram ( EAG ) recordings ( Figure 3B ) . When stimulated with ( Z , E ) -9 , 11-14:OAc , wild-type and SlitOr5+/- antennae exhibited similar EAG amplitudes ( 0 . 89 mV and 1 . 16 mV , respectively ) , whereas the response was completely abolished in SlitOr5-/- antennae ( 0 . 02 mV ) . Control experiments using a S . littoralis minor pheromone component and plant volatiles known to induce EAG responses in S . littoralis ( Saveer et al . , 2012; López et al . , 2017 ) showed that antennal responses were not impaired in SlitOr5-/- mutants , as these odorants elicited similar responses in wild-type , heterozygous and homozygous moths ( Figure 3B ) . Then , we analyzed the courtship behavior of SlitOr5-/- and wild-type males in the presence of ( Z , E ) -9 , 11-14:OAc , and found a strong behavioral defect in mutants . Whereas more than 80% of wild-type males initiated a movement toward the pheromone source in the first 8 min , only a minority of SlitOr5 mutants initiated such a movement ( even after 30 min of test ) , a response similar to that of control wild-type males not stimulated with the pheromone ( Figure 3C ) . All the steps of the courtship behavior were similarly affected ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) . We also verified whether SlitOr5 knock-out would result in mating inability . When paired with a wild-type virgin female , only 1 out of the 13 SlitOr5-/- males tested was able to mate , compared to ~75% for wild-type males ( Figure 3D ) . This behavioral defect was further confirmed by analyzing the number of eggs laid by the females and the number of offspring ( Figure 3E ) . Overall , these results confirm that SlitOR5 is the receptor responsible for the detection of the major component of the S . littoralis female pheromone blend . In view of these results and the unexpected phylogenetic position of SlitOR5 , we rebuilt the phylogeny of the lepidopteran OR clade containing SlitOR5 and the known receptors for type 0 , type I and type II pheromones ( highlighted in grey in Figure 1B ) , adding all ORs showing a strong sex-biased expression ( at least 10-fold in one sex compared to the other ) and ORs whose ligands were known as of September 2018 ( Supplementary file 2 ) . ORs grouped within eight different paralogous lineages , four of which including PRs ( Figure 4 ) . One was the so-called PR clade that , as previously observed , contained all type I PRs characterized so far ( except SlitOR5 ) as well as two type II PRs ( Zhang et al . , 2016 ) . The other three lineages harboring PRs consisted of one containing SlitOR5 , one containing EgriOR31 ( a type II PR from the geometrid Ectropis grisescens; Li et al . , 2017 ) and one containing EsemOR3 and 5 ( type 0 PRs from the non-dytrisian moth Eriocrania semipurpurella; Yuvaraj et al . , 2017 ) . Interestingly , most sex-biased lepidopteran ORs identified to date clustered within the PR clade and the lineage containing SlitOR5 . While sex-biased ORs within the PR clade were mainly male-biased , the SlitOR5 lineage contained an equal proportion of male and female-biased receptors , identified from species belonging to different families of Lepidoptera . Deep nodes within the phylogeny were highly supported by the bootstrap analysis , enabling us to state that these two PR-containing clades were more closely related to clades harboring receptors for plant volatiles than to each other . This suggests that receptors tuned to type I pheromone compounds emerged twice independently during the evolution of Lepidoptera , and that the clade containing SlitOR5 may constitute a novel lineage of candidate PRs . 3 Discussion While moth sex pheromone receptors have been the most investigated ORs in Lepidoptera , with more than 60 being functionally characterized ( Zhang and Löfstedt , 2015 ) , it remains unclear how and when these specialized receptors arose . Type I PRs have been proposed to form a monophyletic , specialized clade of ORs , the so-called ‘PR clade’ , which emerged early in the evolution of Lepidoptera ( Yuvaraj et al . , 2017; Yuvaraj et al . , 2018 ) . Here , we bring functional and phylogenetic evidence that type I PRs are not restricted to this clade and likely appeared twice independently in Lepidoptera . We focused on an atypical OR , SlitOR5 , which exhibited a strong male-biased expression in antennae of the noctuid moth S . littoralis but did not group with the PR clade . We demonstrated , using a combination of heterologous expression and loss-of-function studies , that this OR is responsible for the detection of ( Z , E ) -9 , 11-14:OAc , the major component of the S . littoralis sex pheromone blend . Due to the unexpected phylogenetic position of SlitOR5 outside of the previously defined PR clade , the question arose whether SlitOR5 is an exception or belongs to a previously unknown clade of moth PRs . This latter hypothesis is supported by the observation that the paralogous lineage containing SlitOR5 harbored many other sex-biased ORs , identified in species from six distinct lepidopteran families . Notably , male-biased ORs have been found in Lasiocampidae , Sphingidae , Noctuidae and Tortricidae . Among these , two ORs from Ctenopseustis obliquana and C . herana ( Tortricidae ) have been functionally studied by heterologous expression in cell cultures , but no ligand could be identified ( Steinwender et al . , 2015 ) . In the Lasiocampidae species Dendrolimus punctatus , these male-biased ORs have been referred to as ‘Dendrolimus-specific odorant receptors’ , with the suspicion that they would represent good PR candidates since in Dendrolimus species , there is no OR clustering in the PR clade ( Zhang et al . , 2014; Zhang et al . , 2017 ) . No functional data yet confirmed this suspicion . Conversely , within the SlitOR5 lineage , almost half of the sex-biased ORs were female-biased ( 13 out of 28 , compared to 4 out of 63 in the classical PR clade ) . Female-biased ORs have been generally proposed to be involved in the detection of plant-emitted oviposition cues , as demonstrated in Bombyx mori ( Anderson et al . , 2009 ) . However , another interesting hypothesis is that they could be tuned to male sex pheromones . In moths , little attention has been put on male pheromones , which are known to be involved in various mating behaviors such as female attraction , female acceptance , aggregation of males to form leks , mate assessment or inhibition of other males ( reviewed in Conner and Iyengar , 2016 ) . The use of male pheromone systems has been selected multiple times in distinct moth families , as reflected by the chemical diversity of male pheromone compounds and of the disseminating structures ( Birch et al . , 1990; Phelan , 1997; Conner and Iyengar , 2016 ) . It is thus expected that this polyphyletic nature of male pheromones would result in a large diversity of female PR types . Accordingly , female-biased ORs were found in different clades within the phylogeny . However , most remain orphan ORs , including BmorOR30 that does belong to the SlitOR5 lineage but for which no ligand could be identified ( Anderson et al . , 2009 ) . Although the most common male-emitted volatiles are plant-derived pheromones ( Conner and Iyengar , 2016 ) , some male courtship pheromones are long-chained hydrocarbons related to type I female pheromone compounds ( Hillier and Vickers , 2004 ) that could be detected by female-biased type I PRs such as those identified within the SlitOR5 lineage . The ancestral protein from which the so-called ‘PR clade’ would have arisen is thought to be an OR tuned to plant-emitted volatiles ( Yuvaraj et al . , 2017; Yuvaraj et al . , 2018 ) . Here , we evidence that SlitOR5 is a new type I PR that belongs to a distinct early diverging lineage for which a role in pheromone detection had never been demonstrated . Together with the findings that PRs for Type 0 ( Yuvaraj et al . , 2017 ) and one PR for type II pheromones ( Li et al . , 2017 ) group in distinct paralogous lineages also unrelated to the PR clade , our data suggest that lepidopteran PRs have evolved four times in four paralogous lineages . Whether the SlitOR5 lineage has evolved from ORs that detected structurally related plant volatiles - as has been proposed for type 0 ( Yuvaraj et al . , 2017 ) and classical type I PRs - remains elusive . Yet , no OR tuned to plant volatiles has been identified in closely related lineages . More functional data on SlitOR5 paralogs and orthologs in different moth species , possibly revealing more type I PRs , will help in understanding evolutionary history of this lineage , as to when and how these receptors have evolved , and confirm that we are facing a novel type I PR clade . 4 Materials and methods S . littoralis were reared in the laboratory on a semi-artificial diet ( Poitout and Buès , 1974 ) at 22°C , 60% relative humidity and under a 16 hr light:8 hr dark cycle . Males and females were sexed as pupae and further reared separately . D . melanogaster lines were reared on standard cornmeal-yeast-agar medium and kept in a climate- and light-controlled environment ( 25°C , 12 hr light:12 hr dark cycle ) . The 26 pheromone compounds used for electrophysiology experiments ( Supplementary file 1 ) were either synthesized in the lab or purchased from Sigma-Aldrich ( St Louis , MO ) and Pherobank ( Wijk bij Duurstede , The Netherlands ) . Paraffin oil was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and hexane from Carlo Erba Reagents ( Val de Reuil , France ) . Total RNA from three biological replicates of 15 pairs of antennae of two-day-old virgin male and female S . littoralis was extracted using RNeasy Micro Kit ( Qiagen , Hilden , Germany ) , which included a DNase treatment . cDNA was synthesized from total RNA ( 1 μg ) using Invitrogen SuperScript II reverse transcriptase ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA ) . Gene-specific primers were designed for SlitOr5 ( Or5up: 5’-TCGGGAGAAACTGAAGGACGTTGT-3’ , Or5do: 5’-GCACGGAACCGCACTTATCACTAT-3’ ) and for the reference gene SlitRpl13 ( Rpl13up: 5’-GTACCTGCCGCTCTCCGTGT-3’ , Rpl13do: 5’-CTGCGGTGAATGGTGCTGTC-3’ ) . qPCR mix was prepared in a total volume of 10 μL with 5 μL of LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master ( Roche , Basel , Switzerland ) , 4 μL of diluted cDNA ( or water for the negative control ) and 0 . 5 μM of each primer . qPCR assays were performed using the LightCycler 480 Real-Time PCR system ( Roche ) . All reactions were performed in triplicate for the three biological replicates . The PCR program began with a cycle at 95°C for 13 . 5 min , followed by 50 cycles of 10 s at 95°C , 15 s at 60°C and 15 s at 72°C . Dissociation curves of the amplified products were performed by gradual heating from 55°C to 95°C at 0 . 5 °C . s−1 . A negative control ( mix without cDNA ) and a fivefold dilution series protocol of pooled cDNAs ( from all conditions ) were included . The fivefold dilution series were used to construct relative standard curves to determine the PCR efficiencies used for further quantification analyses . Data were analyzed with the LightCycler 480 software ( Roche ) . Normalized expression of the SlitOr5 gene was calculated with the Q-Gene software ( Joehanes and Nelson , 2008 ) using SlitRpl13 as a reference , considering it displays consistent expression as previously described in Durand et al . ( 2010 ) . The SlitOr5 full-length open-reading frame ( 1191 bp , GenBank acc . num . MK614705 ) was subcloned into the pUAST . attB vector . Transformant UAS-SlitOr5 balanced fly lines were generated by BestGene Inc ( Chino Hills , CA ) , by injecting the pUAST . attB-SlitOr5 plasmid ( Endofree prepared , Qiagen ) into fly embryos with the genotype y1 M{vas-int . Dm}ZH-2A w*; M{3xP3-RFP . attP}ZH-51C ( Bischof et al . , 2007 ) , leading to a non-random insertion of the UAS-SlitOr5 construct into the locus 51C of the second chromosome . The UAS-SlitOr5 balanced line was then crossed to the Or67dGAL4 line ( Kurtovic et al . , 2007 ) to obtain double homozygous flies ( genotype w; UAS-SlitOr5 , w+; Or67dGAL4 ) expressing the SlitOr5 transgene in at1 OSNs instead of the endogenous Drosophila receptor gene Or67d . The correct expression of SlitOr5 was confirmed by RT-PCR on total RNA extracted from 100 pairs of antennae . Single-sensillum extracellular recordings on Drosophila at1 OSNs were performed as previously described ( de Fouchier et al . , 2015 ) . OSNs were stimulated during 500 ms , using stimulus cartridges containing 10 μg of pheromone ( 1 μg/μl in hexane ) dropped onto a filter paper . Single-sensillum recordings on S . littoralis LT1A OSNs were performed using the tip-recording technique , as previously described ( Pézier et al . , 2007 ) . Briefly , the tips of a few LT1 sensilla were cut off using sharpened forceps and a recording glass electrode filled with a saline solution ( 170 mM KCl , 25 mM NaCl , 3 mM MgCl2 , 6 mM CaCl2 , 10 mM HEPES and 7 . 5 mM glucose , pH 6 . 5 ) was slipped over the end of a cut LT1 sensillum . OSNs were stimulated with an air pulse of 200 ms ( 10 L . h−1 ) , odorized using a stimulus cartridge containing 1 μg of pheromone ( diluted at 1 μg/μl in hexane ) . Odorants were considered as active if the response they elicited was statistically different from the response elicited by the solvent alone ( one-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey’s post hoc test ) . Open-reading frames of SlitOr5 and SlitOrco ( GenBank acc . num . EF395366 , Malpel et al . , 2008 ) were subcloned into the pCS2+ vector ( Turner and Weintraub , 1994 ) . Template plasmids were fully linearized with PteI for pCS2+-SlitOr5 and NotI for pCS2+-SlitOrco and capped cRNAs were transcribed using SP6 RNA polymerase . Purified cRNAs were re-suspended in nuclease-free water at a concentration of 2 μg/μL and stored at −80°C . Mature healthy oocytes were treated with 2 mg/ml collagenase type I in washing buffer ( 96 mM NaCl , 2 mM KCl , 5 mM MgCl2 and 5 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 6 ) for 1–2 hr at room temperature . Oocytes were later microinjected with 27 . 6 ng of SlitOr5 cRNA and 27 . 6 ng of SlitOrco cRNA . After 4 days of incubation at 18°C in 1 × Ringer’s solution ( 96 mM NaCl , 2 mM KCl , 5 mM MgCl2 , 0 . 8 mM CaCl2 , and 5 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 6 ) supplemented with 5% dialyzed horse serum , 50 mg/ml tetracycline , 100 mg/ml streptomycin and 550 mg/ml sodium pyruvate , the whole-cell currents were recorded from the injected oocytes with a two-electrode voltage clamp . Oocytes were exposed to the 26 pheromone compounds diluted at 10−4 M in Ringer’s solution , with an interval between exposures which allowed the current to return to baseline . Data acquisition and analysis were carried out with Digidata 1440A and pCLAMP10 software ( Molecular Devices , San Jose , CA ) . Odorants were considered as active if the mean response they elicited was statistically different from 0 ( Wilcoxon signed rank test ) . Dose–response experiments were performed using pheromone concentrations ranging from 10−9 up to 10−5 M and data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 5 . A guide RNA ( gRNA sequence: AGCATAAATACTGGACCCAG TGG ) was designed against the first exon of the SlitOr5 gene using the CRISPOR gRNA design tool ( crispor . tefor . net; Haeussler et al . , 2016 ) and transcribed after subcloning into the DR274 vector using the HiScribe T7 High Yield RNA Synthesis Kit ( New England Biolabs , Ipswich , MA ) . The Cas9 protein was produced in Escherichia coli as previously described ( Ménoret et al . , 2015 ) . A mix of Cas9 protein and gRNA was injected in freshly laid eggs using an Eppendorf - Transjector 5246 , as previously described ( Koutroumpa et al . , 2016 ) . Individual genotyping at every generation was performed via PCR on genomic DNA extracted from larvae pseudopods ( Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit , Promega , Madison , WI ) using gene-specific primers ( Or5_forward: 5’-CCAAAAGGACTTGGACTTTGAA-3’; Or5_reverse: 5’-CCCGAATCTTTTCAGGATTAGAA-3’ ) amplifying a fragment of 728 bp encompassing the target sequence . Mutagenic events were detected by sequencing the amplification products ( Biofidal , Vaulx-en-Velin , France ) . G0 larvae carrying a single mutagenic event were reared until adults and crossed with wild-type individuals . Homozygous G2 individuals were obtained by crossing G1 heterozygous males and females . Electroantennogram recordings were performed as previously described ( Koutroumpa et al . , 2016 ) on isolated male antennae from wild-type animals and from heterozygous and homozygous SlitOr5 mutants . Antennae were stimulated using stimulus cartridges loaded with 10 μg of linalool or benzyl alcohol diluted in paraffin oil , and 1 μg of ( Z , E ) -9 , 11-14:OAc or ( Z , E ) -9 , 12-14:OAc diluted in hexane . Stimulations lasted for 500 ms ( 30 L/h ) . Negative controls consisted of paraffin oil and hexane alone . The maximum depolarization amplitude was measured using the pCLAMP10 software . Normalized mean responses were calculated ( response to the solvent was subtracted ) and data were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey’s post hoc test . For courtship monitoring , 2-day-old wild-type or homozygous SlitOr5 mutant males were placed individually in a plastic squared petri dish ( size = 12 cm ) before the onset of the scotophase , and experiments started at the middle of the scotophase ( 22°C , 70% relative humidity ) . Odorant stimulation was performed using Pasteur pipettes containing a filter paper loaded with 100 ng of ( Z , E ) -9 , 11-14:OAc ( 10 ng/μl in hexane ) , or hexane alone as control . The narrow end of the pipette was inserted into the petri dish , and a constant stream of charcoal-filtered , humidified air ( 0 . 2 L . min−1 ) passed through the pipette during all the experiment . Male courtship behavior was recorded under dim red light during 30 min using a webcam ( Logitech QuickCam Pro 9000 ) . The latency of each of the following stereotyped behavioral items was individually screened: antennal flicking , movement toward the odor source , wing fanning , abdomen curving and extrusion of genitalia . Results were presented as cumulative occurrence of each item along the time of the experiment . Statistical analysis of the distributions obtained for each treatment were compared using a log-rank ( Mantel-Cox ) test . For mating experiments , 2-day-old wild-type or homozygous SlitOr5 mutant males were paired with a 2-day-old wild-type virgin female in a cylindrical plastic box ( diameter 8 cm , height 5 cm ) , the walls of which were covered up with filter paper . Experiments started at the onset of the scotophase and lasted over 6 hr . Copulation events were visually inspected every 20 min under dim red light . After the end of the experiment , females were kept in the boxes for 12 hr . Then , females were discarded and filter papers were examined for the presence of egg clutches . When present , eggs were transferred to a rearing plastic box , hatch was monitored every day during 7 days and second-instar larvae were counted , if any . Statistical analysis of mating rates was done using a Fisher’s exact test , and analyses of the number of eggs and offspring were done using a Mann-Whitney U test . The dataset of lepidopteran amino acid OR sequences used to build the phylogeny shown in Figure 1 included entire OR repertoires from the following nine species , each belonging to a different lepidopteran superfamily: Bombyx mori ( Bombycoidea; Tanaka et al . , 2009 ) , Dendrolimus punctatus ( Lasiocampoidea; Zhang et al . , 2017 ) , Ectropis grisescens ( Geometroidea; Li et al . , 2017 ) , Epiphyas postvittana ( Tortricoidea; Corcoran et al . , 2015 ) , Eriocrania semipurpurella ( Eriocranioidea; Yuvaraj et al . , 2017 ) , Heliconius melpomene ( Papilionoidea; Heliconius Genome Consortium , 2012 ) , Ostrinia furnacalis ( Pyraloidea; Yang et al . , 2015 ) , Plutella xylostella ( Yponomeutoidea; Engsontia et al . , 2014 ) and Spodoptera littoralis ( Noctuoidea; Walker et al . , 2019 ) . The dataset used to build the phylogeny shown in Figure 4 contained amino acid sequences from the same nine species falling into that clade , plus all the sequences of ORs within that clade showing a marked sex-biased expression ( threshold of a 10-fold difference in expression rate between male and female antennae , based on RNAseq or qPCR experiments ) and/or for which ligands have been identified as of September 2018 ( Supplementary file 2 ) . Alignments were performed using Muscle ( Edgar , 2004 ) as implemented in Jalview v2 . 10 . 5 ( Waterhouse et al . , 2009 ) . Phylogenetic reconstruction was performed using maximum likelihood . The best-fit model of protein evolution was selected by SMS ( Lefort et al . , 2017 ) and tree reconstruction was performed using PhyML 3 . 0 ( Guindon et al . , 2010 ) . Node support was first assessed using 100 bootstrap iterations , then the file containing bootstrap trees was uploaded on the Booster website ( Lemoine et al . , 2018 ) to obtain the TBE ( Transfer Bootstrap Expectation ) node support estimation . Figures were created using the iTOL web server ( Letunic and Bork , 2016 ) ."}

For example , we perceive a park landscape differently when we are running through it than when we are sitting on a park bench . Behavior can also alter neuronal responses in the brain . Indeed , the neurons in the part of the brain that receives information related to vision ( known as the visual cortex ) respond differently to visual stimuli when an animal is moving compared to when the animal is still . However , while some recent studies revealed that specific types of neurons become more or less responsive during movement , others reported the opposite results . One hypothesis that would explain these contradictory findings would be if the way that behavior , in this case movement , affects neuronal responses also depends on the external context in which the movement happens . Now , Pakan et al . have tested this hypothesis by imaging the activity of different types of neurons in the primary visual cortex of mice that were either running on a treadmill or staying still . The experiments were conducted in two different contexts: in total darkness ( in which the mice could not see ) and in the presence of display screens ( which provided the mice with visual stimulation ) . Pakan et al . confirmed that running does indeed affect the activity of specific neurons in different ways in different contexts . For example , when the mice received visual stimulation , the three main classes of neurons that send inhibitory signals in the visual cortex became more active during running . However , when the mouse ran in the dark , two of these neuron types became more active during running while the third type of neuron was unresponsive . This finding reveals more about the dynamic nature of inhibitory activity that strongly depends on the animal’s behaviour . It also shows how these neurons influence the excitatory neurons in the visual cortex , which send information to the rest of the brain for further processing towards perception . The next step will be to identify what precise mechanism makes these neurons respond differently in unique contexts , and to tease apart how these movement-dependent signals affect the way animals perceive visual stimuli .", "article": "1 Introduction Sensory perceptions are modulated by the context in which they are experienced . In primary sensory areas , neuronal responses to sensory inputs are also modulated by behavioral states , including level of arousal , attention and locomotion ( Iriki et al . , 1996; Petersen and Crochet , 2013; Bennett et al . , 2014; McGinley et al . , 2015 ) . In vivo recordings in awake mice have shown that locomotion modulates the response properties of neurons in the primary visual cortex ( V1 ) , resulting in an increased gain of excitatory neuron responses to visual stimuli ( Niell and Stryker , 2010; Keller et al . , 2012; Bennett et al . , 2013; Polack et al . , 2013; Saleem et al . , 2013; Erisken et al . , 2014; Reimer et al . , 2014 ) . However , the neuronal circuits underlying this response modulation are unclear . Recent studies have revealed that a specific subclass of inhibitory neurons , expressing vasoactive intestinal peptide ( VIP ) , strongly increase their activity during locomotion ( Fu et al . , 2014; Reimer et al . , 2014; Jackson et al . , 2016 ) . VIP neurons mainly inhibit a second class of inhibitory neurons , expressing somatostatin ( SST; Figure 1A; Pfeffer et al . , 2013; Jiang et al . , 2015; Urban-Ciecko and Barth , 2016 ) . It has been proposed that cholinergic activation of VIP neurons during locomotion would inhibit SST neurons , alleviating inhibition onto excitatory neurons and , as a consequence , increase the gain of excitatory neuron visual responses ( Figure 1B; Fu et al . , 2014 ) . However , a previous study has reported an increase of SST spiking activity in layer 2/3 during locomotion ( Polack et al . , 2013 ) , an observation that challenges the hypothesis of an SST-cell mediated disinhibitory circuit . The aforementioned recordings of SST neuronal activity were acquired in different sensory contexts , either in darkness or during the presentation of visual stimuli . One hypothesis that would explain the discrepancies between these results is that V1 neuronal responses to locomotion are context-dependent . 10 . 7554/eLife . 14985 . 003Figure 1 .

( B ) Proposed disinhibition model: locomotion activates VIP neurons through cholinergic ( ACh ) inputs , SST neurons are inhibited , which leads to a disinhibition of Pyr neurons and an increase in the gain of visual responses during locomotion ( Fu et al . , 2014 ) .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 14985 . 003 In this study , we tested this hypothesis by directly comparing the locomotion responses of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in darkness and during visual stimulation . We used two-photon calcium imaging to monitor the activity of excitatory neurons as well as of three non-overlapping populations of inhibitory neurons ( VIP , SST and parvalbumin [PV] neurons ) in layer 2/3 and layer 4 of V1 in awake behaving mice . Our results show that during visual stimulation these three classes of interneurons increase their activity with locomotion , challenging the model of a disinhibitory circuit mediated through SST neurons . We found that locomotion affects the activity of inhibitory circuits differently in darkness and during visual stimulation , revealing a context-dependent , cell type specific response to locomotion in V1 . The highest proportion of context-dependent responses to locomotion was found among SST neurons , which play a central role in V1 microcircuits . We suggest alternative mechanisms of how locomotion modulates the neuronal activity in V1 , highlighting the dynamic nature of interneurons function that strongly depends on the behavioral context of the animal . 2 Results Isoluminant grey screen stimulation is commonly used to record so called ‘spontaneous activity’ of neurons in the visual cortex . Since our results showed different locomotion responses in the dark and during the presentation of drifting gratings , we tested whether this difference was due to the presence of patterned visual stimuli or , more simply , to the presence of light ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) . We quantified the amplitude of fluorescence changes during stationary and locomotion periods in all three contexts: darkness , grey screen and drifting gratings . We did not find any significant difference for any of the inhibitory populations ( VIP , SST and PV neurons ) between the two types of visual stimulation ( gratings vs grey screen; Figure 2—figure supplement 1C ) . For excitatory neurons , we found a lower LMI during the presentation of a grey screen than during drifting grating presentation ( mean of median LMI: 0 . 17 ± 0 . 02 grey versus 0 . 19 ± 0 . 02 visual stimulation; p=0 . 033 , n = 12 , Kruskal–Wallis test; Figure 2—figure supplement 1C ( i ) ) . Locomotion responses for each type of visual stimulus ( gratings vs grey screen ) were still significantly higher than during darkness ( mean of median LMI: 0 . 07 ± 0 . 02 dark versus 0 . 17 ± 0 . 02 grey; p=0 . 007 , n = 12 , Kruskal–Wallis test ) ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1C ( i ) ) . These results indicate that , during visual stimulation and independently of the presence of patterned visual stimuli , excitatory , VIP , SST and PV neurons show increased activity during locomotion . While comparisons of a neuronal population’s LMI distribution ( Figure 2C ) indicates how , on average , that cell type is modulated by locomotion in different sensory contexts , it does not provide information about the context-dependent responses of single neurons . For instance , the average LMI could be the same in darkness and during visual stimulation even though individual neurons may have large changes in their LMI , which cancel out when considering the population as a whole . In order to show the diversity of locomotion responses within each neuronal subtype , we examined the LMI value in darkness versus during visual stimulation for each neuron ( Figure 3A ) . Neurons near the identity line show context-independent locomotion responses ( similar LMI in darkness and during visual stimulation ) , while the other neurons changed their response to locomotion from one context to another ( context-dependent responses ) . We first quantified this diversity by calculating the difference between the LMI value during visual stimulation and the LMI value in darkness for each neuron ( Figure 3B ) . These results confirmed that VIP neurons displayed mainly context-independent locomotion responses ( Figure 3B ( ii ) , narrow distribution , centered around 0 ) , while locomotion responses of SST neurons were mainly context dependent ( Figure 3B ( iii ) , broad distribution shifted towards positive values ) . Both excitatory and PV neuronal populations included a diversity of locomotion responses ( broad distributions ) . To quantify the proportions of context-independent and context-dependent neurons in each cell type , we first determined the variability of the locomotion responses for each context by comparing neuronal responses across odd and even locomotion periods ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1; see Materials and methods ) . We found high correlation values for all neuronal populations , both in darkness and during visual stimulation ( 0 . 676 < R < 0 . 944; p<0 . 0001 ) , indicating a general low variability of the responses across different locomotion periods in both contexts . We determined the proportion of context-dependent neurons meeting two criteria: i ) with a response that was significantly different across contexts ( neurons distance from the identity line in Figure 3A , to estimate the error on the LMI in both dark and stimulated conditions for each neuron , bootstrapping was employed ( see Materials and methods ) ) , and ii ) with low variability of locomotion responses ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 14985 . 008Figure 3 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 14985 . 010 These results confirm that most VIP neurons were context-independent , remaining locomotion-responsive in both sensory contexts ( 66% ) , with only 17% of neurons showing context-dependent responses ( Figure 3A ( ii ) , Figure 3—figure supplement 2 ) . The proportion of context-dependent neurons was the highest among SST neurons , with 49% of neurons showing context-dependent responses to locomotion ( Figure 3A ( iii ) , Figure 3—figure supplement 2 ) . Both excitatory and PV neurons had approximately the same proportion of context-dependent neurons ( 22% for excitatory and 25% for PV neurons ) ( Figure 3A ( i ) , ( iv ) ) . Finally , we tested whether context-dependent neurons differ from context-independent ones with regard to the following characteristics: percentage of visually responsive neurons , orientation selectivity and direction selectivity . We did not find any significant difference in any neuronal population ( comparisons between context-dependent and context independent neurons for each cell type , OSI , p>0 . 261; DSI p>0 . 093 , Kruskal–Wallis test ) , suggesting that the mechanisms underlying the modulation of locomotion responses differ from those determining the selectivity of visual responses . Layer 2/3 neurons receive sensory information from excitatory neurons in layer 4 , the main thalamo-recipient layer , as well as top-down information from higher cortical areas ( Niell , 2015 ) . In addition , these neurons receive subcortical inputs from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus as well as neuromodulatory inputs ( Polack et al . , 2013; Fu et al . , 2014; Lee et al . , 2014 ) . Context-dependent locomotion responses of layer 2/3 neurons may thus come from one of these distinct inputs or from a combination of them . By using the same approach as for layer 2/3 neurons , we recorded locomotion responses in layer 4 neurons ( excitatory n = 331; VIP n = 57; SST n = 74; PV n = 109; in 6 , 4 , 6 and 6 mice , respectively ) . As in layer 2/3 , we used local injections of AAVs into V1 for the Cre-inducible expression of the genetically-encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6f . However , we observed that on average the GCaMP6f labelling in layer 4 was sparser than in layer 2/3 ( Figure 1D ) . Thus , we cannot exclude that we preferentially labelled subtypes of layer 4 neurons in which transduction efficiency with these AAV vectors would be higher . The quantification of locomotion responses showed no significant difference between layer 2/3 and layer 4 neurons , in any cell type , both in darkness and during visual stimulation ( Figure 4B , C ) . The results showed a higher mean LMI value for PV neurons in layer 4 ( 0 . 45 ± 0 . 04 ) compared to layer 2/3 ( 0 . 35 ± 0 . 04 ) during visual stimulation . However , this did not reach significance; p=0 . 058 , Mann-Whitney U-test ) . In addition , the results showed similar proportions of context-dependent responses in layer 4 as described in layer 2/3 ( Figure 4A , see also Figure 3A; context-dependent neurons: Exc , L2/3: 22% , L4: 17%; VIP , L2/3: 17% , L4: 26%; SST , L2/3: 49% , L4: 42%; PV , L2/3: 25% , L4: 23% ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 14985 . 011Figure 4 .

Negative values indicate increased responses to locomotion in the dark compared with visual stimulation , positive numbers indicate increased responses to locomotion during visual stimulation , and numbers close to 0 ( within red lines; –0 . 2 < LMIStim-LMIDark < 0 . 2 ) indicate context-independent responses . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 14985 . 011 3 Discussion In this study , we used the relative changes in fluorescence of the genetically-encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6f as a reporter of the spiking activity of cortical neurons ( Chen et al . , 2013 ) . For a given fluorescent calcium indicator , the relationship between the amplitude of somatic fluorescence changes and the number of spikes can be affected by a number of factors including the concentration of calcium buffers in the soma , the balance between calcium influx and efflux as well as calcium release from internal stores ( Grienberger et al . , 2012 ) . Consequently , potential confounding factors in the present study would be ( 1 ) different intracellular calcium dynamics in different types of inhibitory neurons as well as ( 2 ) a higher increase of cytosolic free calcium concentration for the same number of spikes during locomotion compared to stationary periods . Considering that neuromodulators can regulate calcium influx ( Fucile , 2004; Shen and Yakel , 2009 ) , this second possibility may result from the action of neuromodulators released during locomotion that would increase the amount of calcium entering the neuron in response to each spike . In that case , for the same number of spikes , the increase in fluorescence of our calcium indicator would be higher during locomotion than during stationary periods . Without an independent readout of the spiking activity for each neuronal type in each behavioral context , we cannot exclude that the relationship between fluorescence transients and the number of spikes differ between different neurons and different contexts . However , the comparison of our results ( mean ΔF/F0 , Figure 2—figure supplement 1B , ‘stim’ column ) with spiking frequencies published in a previous study ( see Supplementary Table 3 of Polack et al . , 2013 ) in mouse V1 strongly suggests that somatic GCaMP6f fluorescence changes do reflect changes in spiking activity related to locomotion . For the same neuronal populations ( layer 2/3 Excitatory , SST and PV neurons; layer 4 Excitatory neurons ) and visual stimulation condition ( drifting gratings ) , both data sets show the same relative change in signal during locomotion compared to stationary periods ( corresponding to an approximate doubling of activity during locomotion for all three cell types ) . This similarity suggests that somatic GCaMP6 fluorescence changes during locomotion do reflect changes in spiking activity , at least in these cell types during visual stimulation . In this study , we found that SST activity increased with locomotion during visual stimulation . This is in line with previous electrophysiological recordings of SST neurons ( Polack et al . , 2013 ) but in contradiction with the current disinhibitory model that relies on the inhibition of SST neurons during locomotion ( Figure 1B; Fu et al . , 2014 ) . Our results provide an explanation for these discrepancies since the aforementioned electrophysiological recordings were acquired during visual stimulation whereas imaging of SST activity was done in the dark ( Fu et al . , 2014 ) . The disinhibitory model was based on the assumption that the locomotion-driven response of SST neurons would be similar in the dark and during visual stimulation ( Fu et al . , 2014 ) . The same assumption was made in the interpretation of membrane potential fluctuations of VIP and SST neurons recorded during the presentation of a blank screen ( Reimer et al . , 2014 ) . While VIP neurons were reliably depolarized during running , the SST population was heterogeneous . The authors distinguished two populations of SST interneurons ( see Supplementary Figure 5C of Reimer et al . , 2014 ) : Type I cells were inhibited by running while Type II cells were depolarized . Importantly , spiking activity of SST neurons was not reported and it is thus not clear how the membrane potential fluctuations relate to spiking activity . Our findings regarding the locomotion responses of SST neurons in darkness are consistent with the previous imaging study performed in similar conditions ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2 of the present study compared to Figure 3 and Figure S3 of Fu et al . , 2014 ) as well as with the heterogeneity of membrane potential fluctuations of SST neurons during locomotion ( Reimer et al . , 2014 ) . We cannot exclude the possibility that a disinhibitory circuit may underlie the activity of a small fraction of neurons in darkness: the majority of VIP neurons increase their activity with locomotion , while a small proportion of SST neurons are inhibited during locomotion , potentially leading to the increase in activity of some pyramidal neurons . However , the results obtained in darkness show that the majority of SST neurons are not responsive to locomotion at all , challenging the generality of a disinhibitory circuit acting through the inhibition of SST neurons . With visual stimulation , the inconsistency of the disinhibitory model is even stronger since the vast majority of SST neurons increase their activity with locomotion ( see Figure 2B ( iii ) ) . Consequently , the results obtained during visual stimulation ( present study and Polack et al . , 2013 ) are incompatible with a model in which VIP neurons disinhibit excitatory neurons by inhibiting SST neurons . Additionally , while the vast majority of VIP neurons are context-independent with regard to their locomotion response , excitatory neurons show significantly increased locomotion responses during visual stimulation compared to darkness conditions . Therefore , the context-dependent responses of excitatory neurons do not result from a disinhibitory circuit initiated by VIP neurons . An appealing aspect of the disinhibitory model was the idea of a canonical circuit for gain modulation of sensory responses ( Pi et al . , 2013 ) . While the connectivity may be canonical , we show that the circuit activity can strongly differ depending on the behavioral context . Therefore , functional properties of inhibitory neurons should not be generalized from one context to the next , and caution should be taken when inferring connectivity from functional recordings obtained in a specific behavioral context . Our results indicate that , in addition to the activation of VIP neurons during locomotion , other pathways are involved in linking locomotion and visual responses in V1 . We suggest that neuromodulatory inputs triggered by locomotion would not only activate VIP neurons through nicotinic acetylcholine receptors as previously shown ( Alitto and Dan , 2012; Arroyo et al . , 2014; Fu et al . , 2014 ) , but would also directly activate PV , SST , and excitatory neurons . Previous work has demonstrated cholinergic facilitation of cortical inhibitory neurons ( Kawaguchi , 1997; Xiang et al . , 1998; Arroyo et al . , 2012; Alitto and Dan , 2012 ) , including SST neurons ( Kawaguchi , 1997; Fanselow et al . , 2008; Xu et al . , 2013; Chen et al . , 2015 ) . Similarly , in vitro studies have shown that norepinephrine can depolarize both excitatory ( McCormick et al . , 1993; Kirkwood et al . , 1999 ) and inhibitory ( Kawaguchi and Shindou , 1998 ) cortical neurons . Finally , in vivo studies have shown that neuromodulatory inputs , cholinergic and noradrenergic , can control the gain and signal-to-noise ratio of V1 excitatory neurons during locomotion ( Pinto et al . , 2013; Polack et al . , 2013; Bennett et al . , 2014; Lee et al . , 2014 ) . We suggest that in darkness , the effect of neuromodulatory inputs remains subthreshold in SST neurons . During visual stimulation , SST neurons are strongly activated and the effect of neuromodulatory inputs becomes suprathreshold . In agreement with the known intra-cortical connectivity in mouse V1 ( Figure 1A; Pfeffer et al . , 2013; Jiang et al . , 2015 ) , our findings support this neuromodulatory hypothesis . In darkness , VIP and PV neurons are activated by locomotion and inhibit SST and excitatory neurons , preventing their activation by locomotion-dependent inputs . During visual stimulation , SST and excitatory neurons are activated: they overcome the intra-cortical inhibition by VIP and PV neurons and become responsive to direct locomotion-dependent inputs . Since SST neurons provide the main intra-cortical input to VIP neurons ( Pfeffer et al . , 2013 ) and are strongly visually-responsive , they likely inhibit VIP neurons ( or a subpopulation of VIP neurons ) during visual stimulation . This is consistent with the decrease in activity of a portion of VIP neurons that was observed during visual stimulation ( Fu et al . , 2014; see also Figure 2—figure supplement 3B ( ii ) . An alternative or complementary hypothesis to the neuromodulatory pathway is that the modulation of visual inputs by locomotion already takes place in subcortical nuclei , such that the thalamo-cortical inputs received by excitatory neurons , and potentially SST neurons , would convey the increased gain of visual responses during locomotion . Indeed , recent studies have shown that projections from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus ( Erisken et al . , 2014; Roth et al . , 2016 ) and from the thalamic latero-posterior nucleus ( Roth et al . , 2016 ) to V1 both convey locomotion signals . The diversity of context-dependent responses to locomotion within SST , PV and , to a lesser extent , VIP populations indicates that there are functional sub-types within each of these interneuron populations . Based on a comprehensive analysis of morphological and electrophysiological properties of inhibitory neurons , a recent in vitro study has identified seven distinct types of cortical interneurons in layer 2/3 ( Jiang et al . , 2015 ) . Further , in vivo characterization of the activity of these sub-types will be necessary to identify how these populations relate to the different context-dependent responses identified in the present study . 4 Materials and methods Three Cre-driver transgenic mice lines were used to label inhibitory interneurons: Sst<tm2 . 1 ( cre ) Zjh> ( SST-Cre ) [RRID:IMSR_JAX:013044] , Pvalb<tm1 ( cre ) Arbr> ( PV-Cre ) [RRID:IMSR_JAX:008069] , Vip<tm1 ( cre ) Zjh> ( VIP-Cre ) [RRID:IMSR_JAX:010908] , all originally obtained from Jackson Laboratory , ME , USA . These lines were cross-bred with Rosa-CAG-LSL-tdTomato [RRID:IMSR_JAX:007914] mice . C57Bl/6 wild type mice ( Jackson Laboratory , ME ) were used for virus injections targeting the expression of GCaMP6 in CaMKII-expressing neurons . Mice were group housed ( typically 2–4 mice ) and both male and female mice were used for the experiments . All procedures were approved by the University of Edinburgh animal welfare committee , and were performed under a UK Home Office project license . Imaging was performed using a custom-built resonant scanning two-photon microscope with a Ti:Sapphire pulsing laser ( Chameleon Vision-S , Coherent , CA , USA; < 70 fs pulse width , 80 MHz repetition rate ) tuned to 920 nm . Using a 40X objective ( 0 . 8 NA , Nikon ) , 600×600 pixel images with a field-of-view of 250 × 250 μm were acquired at 40 Hz with custom-programmed LabVIEW based software ( version 8 . 2; National Instruments , UK ) . We used two-photon calcium imaging in head-fixed mice that ran freely on a cylindrical treadmill ( Figure 1C; Dombeck et al . , 2007 ) . Habituation and imaging started 2–3 weeks after AAV injection . Mice were habituated to head-fixation in the dark for 45 min and began to run freely on a polystyrene cylinder ( 20 cm diameter , on a ball-bearing mounted axis ) . The mice’s running speed on the circular treadmill was continuously monitored using an optical encoder ( E7P , 250cpr , Pewatron , Switzerland ) connected to a data acquisition device ( National Instrument , UK ) with custom-written software in LabView ( National Instrument , UK ) and analyzed in MATLAB ( Mathworks , MA ) . Mice could run freely and spent on average 26 ± 2% of the time running in the dark and 41 ± 2% during visual stimulation ( n = 48 mice , 51 sessions ) . Two-photon imaging was performed at 2–3 focal planes per mouse , at cortical depths between 130 and 350 μm for L2/3 neurons and 350–500 μm for L4 neurons ( cortical layers were confirmed on histological sections , see below ) . Laser power at the brain surface was kept below 50 mW . Mice with excessive brain movement artifacts were excluded . At each focal plane ( n = 100 fields of view ) , 8–12 trials ( 60 s duration ) were acquired in total darkness and 12–20 trials acquired during visual stimulation , with dark and visual stimulation trials randomly interleaved . Visual stimuli were generated using the Psychophysics Toolbox package ( Brainard , 1997 ) for MATLAB ( Mathworks , MA ) and displayed on an LCD monitor ( 51 × 29 cm , Dell , UK ) placed 20 cm from the right eye , covering 104° × 72° of the visual field . Visual stimulation trials consisted of stationary full-field square-wave gratings for 4–5 s and the corresponding drifting phase for 2 s ( 0 . 03 cpd , 1 Hz , 8 equally spaced directions in randomized order , contrast 80% , mean luminance 37 cd/m2 ) . Each trial started and ended with a grey screen ( isoluminance ) . Additional grey screen data were obtained during the presentation of an isoluminant grey screen for 5–15 s preceding the presentation of each oriented grating for 5 s ( 0 . 03 cpd , 1 Hz , 4 equally spaced orientations in randomized order , contrast 80% , mean luminance 37 cd/m2 ) . At the end of the imaging session , red retrograde beads ( Lumafluor , USA ) were injected either at the surface or at 2 different focal planes at which neurons had been imaged . This red labelling was used as a structural landmark in histological sections to confirm which cortical layers had been imaged . Animals were transcardially perfused with 0 . 9% saline and 4% PFA in phosphate buffer ( 0 . 1 M ) . Brains were sliced with a vibratome ( 50 µm thick ) and rinsed in phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) . The slices were then mounted and counterstained with either DAPI ( Vectashield mounting medium , Vector Labs , UK ) or NeuroTrace 640/660 fluorescent Nissl stain ( 1:2000; RRID:nlx_152414 , Life Technologies , NY ) and coverslipped . Sections were imaged with a confocal microscope ( Nikon A1R , Nikon Instruments , UK ) to define the boundaries of cortical layers and localize the retrograde beads injected at the imaged focal planes in vivo ."}

The information in the DNA is stored as a code consisting of four chemical bases , often referred to simply as “A” , “C” , “G” and “T” . The order or sequence of these bases determines the role of a protein . Many organisms – including humans – are built of many different types of cells that perform unique roles . Almost all cells carry the same genetic information , but proteins called transcription factors can regulate the activity of genes so that only a relevant subset of genes is switched on at a particular time . Transcription factors glide along DNA and bind to short DNA sequences by attaching to the DNA bases directly or through bridges made up of water molecules . Two physical concepts known as enthalpy and entropy determine the strength of the connection . Enthalpy relates to how strong the chemical bonds that form between the transcription factors and the DNA bases are , compared to a situation where the transcription factor and DNA do not form a complex and bind to water molecules around them . Entropy measures the disorder of the system – the more disordered the solvent and protein-DNA complex are compared to solvent-containing free DNA and protein , the stronger the binding . A water molecule that bridges a DNA base with an amino-acid of a protein contributes to enthalpy , but results in loss of entropy , because the system becomes more ordered since the water molecule can no longer move freely . Most transcription factors can only bind to DNA sequences that are very similar to each other , but some transcription factors can recognize several different kinds of sequences , and until now it was not clear how they could do this . Morgunova et al . studied four different human transcription factors that can each bind to two distinct DNA sequences . The results showed that the transcription factors bound to both DNA sequences with similar strength , but via different mechanisms . For one DNA sequence , an enthalpy-based mechanism essentially ‘froze’ the transcription factor to the DNA through rigid water bridges . The other DNA sequence was bound equally strongly but through moving water molecules , because this increased the entropy of the system . It is possible that these mechanisms could also apply to many other molecules that interact with each other through water-molecule bridges . A better knowledge of the chemical bonds between transcription factors and DNA bases may in future help efforts to develop new treatments that depend on molecules being able to bind to other molecules . In addition , these findings may one day help scientists to predict how strongly two molecules will interact simply by knowing the structures of the molecules involved .", "article": "1 Introduction The binding of transcription factors ( TFs ) to their specific sites on genomic DNA is a key event regulating cellular processes . Analysis of structures of known TFs bound to DNA has revealed three different mechanisms of recognition of the specifically bound sequences: ( 1 ) the ‘direct readout’ mechanism involving the formation of specific hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions between DNA bases and protein amino acids ( Aggarwal et al . , 1988; Anderson et al . , 1987; Wolberger et al . , 1988 ) ; ( 2 ) ‘indirect readout’ of the DNA shape and electrostatic potential ( Dror et al . , 2014; Hizver et al . , 2001; Joshi et al . , 2007; Lavery , 2005; Rohs et al . , 2005 ) by protein contacts to the DNA backbone or the minor groove , and ( 3 ) water mediated interactions between bases and amino-acids ( Bastidas and Showalter , 2013; Garner and Rau , 1995; Ladbury et al . , 1994; Morton and Ladbury , 1996; Patikoglou and Burley , 1997; Poon , 2012; Spolar and Record , 1994 ) . Each of these mechanisms contributes to binding specificity of most TFs , with their relative importance varying depending on the TF and the recognized sequence . The modes of DNA recognition differ from each other also in their thermodynamic characteristics . For example , direct hydrogen bonds can contribute strongly to enthalpy of binding , whereas indirect hydrogen bonds mediated by water are weaker , due to the loss of entropy caused by immobilization of the bridging water molecule . In many cases , the contributions of the loss of entropy and the gain in enthalpy are similar in magnitude , leading to a phenomenon called ‘enthalpy-entropy compensation’ ( Chodera and Mobley , 2013; Jen-Jacobson et al . , 2000; Klebe , 2015; Patikoglou and Burley , 1997 ) . This leads to binding promiscuity , allowing a TF to bind to several different but closely related sequences with a biologically relevant affinity . Many transcription factors appear to only recognize sequences closely related to a single optimal site . Their binding to DNA can be approximated by a position weight matrix ( PWM ) model , which describes a single optimal site , and assumes that individual substitutions affect binding independently of each other . Thus , the combined effect of multiple mutations is predictable from the individual effects . However , it is well established that several TFs can bind with high affinity to multiple different sequences , and populations of sequences that are closely related to these optimal sites ( Badis et al . , 2009; Johnson et al . , 2007; Jolma et al . , 2013; Morris et al . , 2011; Zhao and Stormo , 2011; Zuo et al . , 2017 ) . In such cases , the effect of substitution mutations is not independent , and instead the mutations display strongly epistatic behavior ( Anderson et al . , 2015; Jolma et al . , 2013; Lehner , 2011; Zuo et al . , 2017 ) , where the combined effect of two mutations can be less severe than what is predicted from the individual effects . Many cases of such multiple specificity can be explained by different spacing of homodimeric TFs ( Aggarwal et al . , 1988; Párraga et al . , 1998 ) , but in some cases a single monomeric TF appears to be able to bind to two distinct sequences with similar affinities . The molecular mechanism behind the multiple specificity phenomenon has been understood at the structural level for some dimers ( Párraga et al . , 1998 ) but not for monomeric TFs . To elucidate the mechanism , we performed structural analysis of two homeodomain proteins , the posterior homeodomain protein HOXB13 , and the parahox protein CDX2 , each bound to two distinct high-affinity sequences . The optimal sequences for HOXB13 are CCAATAAA and CTCGTAAA that differ from each other by the three underlined base pairs , whereas CDX2 binds with high affinity to similar two sequences that begin with a G instead of a C . This analysis , together with thermodynamic measurements of HOXB13 , CDX2 and two other transcription factors , BARHL2 and MYF5 that also display multiple specificity revealed that in each case , one of the optimal sequences is bound primarily due to an optimal enthalpic contribution , whereas the other is bound due to an optimum of entropy . This result is likely to be general to most macromolecular interactions , as they commonly involve interaction of the macromolecules with a network of interconnected water-molecules , whose formation involves a trade-off between enthalpy and entropy . 2 Results and discussion Many TFs have been reported to display multiple specificity . These include many biologically important transcription factors such as the MYF family of basic helix-loop helix factors ( Yin et al . , 2017 ) , the nuclear receptor HNF4A ( Badis et al . , 2009 ) , and the homeodomain proteins BARHL2 , CDX1 and HOXB13 ( Jolma et al . , 2013; Jolma et al . , 2015; Nitta et al . , 2015; Zuo et al . , 2017 ) . Analysis of enrichment of subsequences by MYF6 , BARHL2 , CDX1 and HOXB13 in SELEX reveals that a single PWM model cannot describe the binding affinity of these factors to DNA ( Figure 1A–D ) . Each of these factors has more than one locally optimal sequence . All sequences between these optima have lower affinity and enrich less in SELEX than the optimal sequences . Therefore , more than one positionally independent position weight matrix ( PWM ) model is required for describing their affinity towards DNA ( Figure 1 ) . Combinations of mutations affecting the optimal sites of these TFs display extremely strong epistatic effects . For example , the effect of mutating three first bases of the optimal HOXB13 motif TCGTAAAA is more than 400-fold smaller than what is expected from the individual single mutants ( Figure 1E , F ) , and the generated CAATAAAA site binds to HOXB13 with almost the same affinity as the initial unmutated sequence . To understand the molecular basis of the epistatic effect , we decided to solve the structure of HOXB13 and CDX2 bound to their two optimal sequences . These proteins are related , but diverged significantly in primary sequence , showing 43% identity at amino-acid level ( Figure 1—figure supplements 1 and 2 ) . For structural analysis , the DNA-binding domains ( DBD ) of HOXB13 ( the 75 amino-acids from Asp-209 to Pro-283 ) and CDX2 ( the residues Arg-154 – Gln-256 ) were expressed in E . coli , purified and crystallized bound to synthetic 19 or 18 bp double stranded DNA fragments containing the CTCGTAAA/GTCGTAAA ( DNATCG ) or CCAATAAA/GCAATAAA ( DNACAA ) motifs , respectively . These core sequences were obtained by PBM ( Berger et al . , 2008 ) and HT-SELEX ( Jolma et al . , 2013 ) , and validated by ChIP-seq experiments ( Yin et al . , 2017 ) , and represent the two distinct binding sites of HOXB13 and CDX2 ( Figure 2 ) . The structures were solved using molecular replacement at resolutions 3 . 2 and 2 . 2 Å for HOXB13 , and 2 . 57 and 2 . 95 Å for CDX2 , respectively . All complexes displayed a high overall similarity to HOXB13 bound to methylated DNA ( Yin et al . , 2017 ) , and to the previously known DNA-bound HOX protein structures ( Hovde et al . , 2001; Joshi et al . , 2007; LaRonde-LeBlanc and Wolberger , 2003; Passner et al . , 1999; Piper et al . , 1999; Zhang et al . , 2011 ) ( Figure 2; Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . Two parts of both HOXB13 and CDX2 DBDs interact with DNA: the recognition helix α3 , which tightly packs into the major groove , and the N-terminal tail interacting with the minor groove ( Figure 2A , C ) . The residue Gly-84 that is affected by a coding variant that is strongly implicated in prostate cancer was not included in our construct; two other residues mutated in single prostate cancer families ( Ewing et al . , 2012 ) were predicted to destabilize the protein ( R229G ) , or its interaction with DNA ( G216C ) ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ) . The core interactions between both HOXB13 and CDX2 DBDs and DNA are similar to those known from earlier structures ( Hovde et al . , 2001; Joshi et al . , 2007; LaRonde-LeBlanc and Wolberger , 2003; Passner et al . , 1999; Piper et al . , 1999; Yin et al . , 2017; Zhang et al . , 2011 ) . The TAAA sequence characteristic of the posterior homeodomains is recognized by a combination of a direct hydrogen bond to the A10 base opposite of the T , and an insertion of the N-terminal basic amino-acids to the narrow minor groove induced by the stretch of four As . The overall protein structure in the four complexes is highly similar , showing only minor differences in the conformation of the N-termini , due to the replacement of basic Arg-217 of HOXB13 with the negatively charged Asp-187 in CDX2 ( Figure 2A , B , C , D; Figure 1—figure supplement 2B ) . The most remarkable difference between the complexes is in the conformation of DNA of the HOXB13-DNATCG complex at the position of the divergent bases ( Figure 2A , C; Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) . To quantitate the shape of the DNA in the protein binding region we determined the helicoidal parameters using the program Curves+ ( Lavery et al . , 2009 ) , and found that the most prominent differences between the two complexes were in twist , shift , slide , X- and Y-displacement , minor groove width , and major groove depth at the positions of the divergent CAA and TCG sequences ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1B ) . The DNATCG backbone is bent towards the major groove , facilitating contact with Arg-258 of the recognition helix with the DNA backbone . The corresponding contact ( Arg-228 to backbone ) is also observed in both CDX2 structures . In contrast , the DNACAA backbone is bent towards the minor groove , leading to a contact with N-terminal Arg-217 and Lys-218 ( Figure 2B; Figure 3 ) . Instead of contacting the DNA backbone , Arg-258 assumes an alternative conformation in which it turns inside of the major groove , forming a water-mediated contact with Gln-265 . The Gln-265 , in turn , recognizes C6’ via a direct hydrogen bond . In addition , the CAA sequence is recognized by a hydrophobic interaction between Ile-262 and the T11 methyl group . In CDX2 complexes the DNA bend in CDX2-DNATCG is slightly smaller due to the replacement of Thr-261 with Lys-231 which does not allow the alternative conformation of Arg-228 . The other contacts in the CDX2-DNA complexes are very similar to those listed for HOXB13-DNAs . In order to understand the role of individual residues in binding of specific DNA we created 48 different single and combined mutations in DBD of HOXB13 . This set of experiments was carried out to mechanistically understand the origin of the dual specificity , and the molecular mechanisms that explain different specificities between the posterior HOX proteins . The resulting data are presented in Figure 2E and Figure 2—figure supplement 2 . The replacement of Thr-261 either as a single mutation or in combination with any other amino-acids resulted in changing of HOXB13 specificity from Ctcg/Ccaa towards the sequence recognized by CDX2 ( Gtcg/Gcaa; Figure 2E , left panel ) . No substitutions were identified that would lead to a specific and complete loss of binding to either the TCG or CAA sequence . However , some weaker effects were detected; several mutations affecting backbone contacts between HOXB13 amino-acids and DNA 5' of the divergent trinucleotide moderately increased the relative affinity towards the CAA sequence ( Figure 2E , right panel ) . Analysis of the mutation data together with the structures revealed that amino-acids involved in the protein-DNA interface formation cannot fully explain the specificity preferences of HOXB13 and CDX2 . The lack of direct interactions between protein and DNA in this region instead suggests that the specificity would be conferred in part by bridging water-molecules located at the protein-DNA interface . The main difference between the complexes with DNACAA and DNATCG is revealed by analysis of the bridging water molecules . The HOXB13-DNACAA structure ( 2 . 2 Å ) contains chains of water molecules that interact with both HOXB13 amino-acids and each of the DNA bases in the CAA sequence ( Figure 4A–C ) . In contrast , no water molecules are visible in the HOXB13-DNATCG structure , despite the 3 . 2 Å resolution that should allow identification of strongly bound water molecules . Consistently , only few water molecules were found in the CDX2-DNATCG complex . A relatively large solvent channel ( 6 . 4 Å in smallest diameter ) exists between the α3 helix of HOXB13 and DNATCG ( Figure 4D ) while this space is occupied by well-defined water-net including Arg-258 in HOXB13-DNACAA structure ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1A ) . The electron density in this region of HOXB13-DNATCG structure is low ( σ < 0 . 5 ) , similar to that found in the surrounding solvent , indicating that the water-molecules in this region are highly mobile . Thus , the optimal binding of HOXB13 to the CAA sequence can be rationalized by the visible interactions that contribute to the enthalpy of binding ( ∆H ) . In contrast , no such interactions can be identified that could explain the preference of HOXB13 to the TCG trinucleotide . The absence of ordered solvent molecules , and the lower resolution of the HOXB13-DNATCG structure is consistent with the possibility that the TCG sequence is preferred because it represents a relatively disordered , high entropy state . In complex of CDX2-DNATCG with high resolution ( 2 . 57 Å ) the water molecules were well visible but they did not form the corresponding water-chains ( Figure 4E , F ) supporting the idea of entropically driven binding . The channel is not as clearly visible from one side of the CDX2-DNATCG complex because of the presence of Lys-231 instead of Thr-261 . The long side chain of Lys-231 does not allow Arg-228 ( corresponded to Arg-258 in HOXB13 ) to change its conformation easily . Together , Arg-228 and Lys-231 close the entry of the channel from this side but the other end of the channel is open and well visible in CDX2-DNATCG ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1B , C ) . We next performed molecular dynamics simulations and free energy perturbation calculations to probe the behavior of water molecules in the protein-DNA interface for the two optimal sequences for HOXB13 . The relative free energy ( Hansson et al . , 1998 ) estimates for the affinities of HOXB13 for the two DNA sequences obtained from the simulations indicate that both sequences are bound with similar affinities ( ΔΔG = - 0 . 1 kcal/mol ) . Analysis of the mobility of water molecules at the protein-DNA interface revealed that , while there is a similar number of water molecules in both systems , the waters at the HOXB13-DNATCG interface are more mobile ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) , consistent with a model where this complex has higher entropy than the HOXB13-DNACAA complex . To more directly test if the two states are driven by enthalpy and entropy , we measured these thermodynamic parameters using isothermal titration calorimetry ( ITC ) . ITC directly measures the heat of binding ( ΔH ) and Kd of the binding reaction . Conversion of the Kd to ΔG then allows the inference of the entropy of binding ( ΔS ) from the data . The measured thermodynamic parameters for the TCG site were very similar to those we reported previously ( Yin et al . , 2017 ) . Comparison of the parameters for the TCG and CAA sites revealed that consistent with SELEX ( Jolma et al . , 2013 ) and molecular modeling data , the ΔG values for both sequences were similar . However , as predicted , the CAA site displayed much higher change in enthalpy , and larger loss of entropy compared to those of the TCG site ( Figure 5A , B , Supplementary file 1 ) . These results indicate that HOXB13 binding to one optimal site , CAA , is driven by enthalpy , whereas strong binding to the other , TCG , is due to a lower loss of entropy . To test if the identified mechanism is general to other cases of multiple specificity , we used ITC to determine the thermodynamic parameters for CDX2 and two other TFs , the MYF family TF MYF5 and the homeodomain protein BARHL2 , both of which can optimally bind to two distinct sequence populations . Analysis of the data confirmed that in both cases , the ΔG values for the two optimally bound sequences were similar , whereas the relative contributions of entropy and enthalpy to the binding were strikingly different ( Figure 5C–H ) . These results suggest that the ability of some TFs to bind to two distinct sequences with high affinity can be caused by the presence of both an enthalpic and an entropic optima . In drug development , multiple optimal compounds can often be found that bind to a particular target molecule ( Klebe , 2015 ) . However , biological macromolecules are composed of a small set of relatively large monomers , and thus populate the shape-space more sparsely than synthetic small molecules , which can be modified at the level of single atoms . Therefore , the finding that TFs can bind to two distinct DNA sequences with equal affinity was unexpected ( Badis et al . , 2009; Jolma et al . , 2013 ) and has been controversial in the field . Our initial hypothesis was that the two optimal states could be due to an ability of the TF to adopt two distinct conformational states , or due to a similarity of the shapes of the two distinct DNA sequences ( Kalodimos et al . , 2002; Nakagawa et al . , 2013; Párraga et al . , 1998 ) . To address these hypotheses , we solved the structure of HOXB13 , a central transcription factor involved in both development ( Economides and Capecchi , 2003; Krumlauf , 1994; Nolte et al . , 2015 ) and tumorigenesis ( Ewing et al . , 2012; Huang and Cai , 2014; Pomerantz et al . , 2015 ) bound to its two optimal DNA sequences . Surprisingly , the conformational differences between the HOXB13 proteins in the two structures were minor . Similarly , the two CDX2-DNA structures also displayed very similar overall conformations . In addition , the shape and charge-distribution of the optimally bound DNA sequences were not similar to each other . Thus , the structural analysis failed to support either the dual protein conformation or the DNA shape similarity models . Instead , thermodynamic analyses of HOXB13 , CDX2 , BARHL2 and MYF5 revealed that the two optimal states were bound because of their distinct effects on enthalpy and entropy , principally caused by differential stability of the water network at the protein-DNA interface . We also failed to find mutations in HOXB13 that would specifically abolish binding to one of the DNA sites . This finding is consistent with the thermodynamic model presented , as both TCG and CAA are bound by the same conformation of the HOXB13 protein , using the same contacting amino-acids ( even when the contacts can occur via water or be direct ) . Our findings explain the mechanism behind the observed genetic epistasis at some TF binding sites . In addition , our findings are relevant to evolution of TF binding sites and macromolecular interactions . The ability of one molecular shape ( HOXB13 ) to bind to two distinct molecular shapes ( CAA and TCG ) with similar affinity allows other mechanisms to selectively modulate target sites in the genome . For example , one of the HOXB13 optima , TCG , is affected by DNA methylation ( Yin et al . , 2017; Zuo et al . , 2017 ) , and methylation of this site further increases HOXB13 affinity . The CAA site does not contain a CpG dinucleotide , and thus cannot be inheritably methylated . Thus , the ability of HOXB13 to bind to two distinct sites with similar affinity allows evolution of two types of regulatory sequences , those that are directly and positively affected by CpG methylation , and those that are not . The mechanism by which TFs bind to two optimal DNA sequences is fundamental , and applies to all macromolecular interactions . In principle , enthalpy and entropy of binding vary partially independently as a function of the shape and charge distribution of the interacting molecules . Thus , different sequences are likely to be optimal with respect to enthalpy and entropy , in such a way that one optimal sequence is close to the optimal enthalpy state , and another is close to the optimal entropy state ( Figure 6 ) . We are not aware of work that has previously described such a situation . The observed effect that commonly results in at least two distinct ΔG minima may have been missed before because it is generally strongest when there are solvent molecules at the interacting surface . Interacting through solvent molecules can increase enthalpy of binding , but also causes a large loss of entropy due to fixing of the solvent molecule ( s ) . However , in macromolecular interactions that are driven by direct contact between residues , entropy often has lower impact on binding than enthalpy , and thus one of the optima is at a higher ΔG than the other . Another reason for overlooking this mechanism could have been the fact that multiple local optima can also exist via other mechanisms ( see for example [Klebe , 2015] ) , and measurements that allow inference of entropy and enthalpy separately are not commonly performed in studies of macromolecular interactions . In addition , simple additive binding models such as position weight matrices ( PWMs ) can hide the effect , as they can only describe a single optimal state . The cases we studied here represent some of the strongest deviations from the PWM model , and also present two optima of very similar ΔG that are located relatively far from each other in sequence space . Because we selected for this study cases with two almost equally strong binding sequences , the effect is likely to be stronger here than in most other interactions . Thus , the relative importance of the phenomenon across other types of interactions needs to be evaluated experimentally . The phenomenon we observed exists due to the fact that entropy and enthalpy of binding vary as a function of the shape of the interacting macromolecules . Both functions will have optima , commonly at different exact positions . The binding free energy will also vary as a function of the shape , but is likely to have more optima than its constituent functions because they are partially independent of each other . Thus , it is likely that many other biologically relevant examples of this effect will be identified . Many of these will represent cases where the sequences representing entropic and enthalpic optima are more closely related to each other than in the extreme cases studied here . This would manifest as a ‘flat bottom’ in the affinity landscape , where many sequences would bind with similar affinity . In addition , it is likely that in most cases one of the local optima is located at lower affinity than the other . This would manifest as a minor peak or a shoulder in the affinity landscape away from the optimal sequence . In each case , the measured affinities would deviate from those predicted from a single PWM model . Our results and the underlying theory suggest that the ability of TFs to bind to distinct sequences could thus be widespread , and that the importance of the optimal states in determining TF-DNA binding preferences should be reinvestigated . Moreover , models for TF binding that are used to identify TF sites should also be adjusted to include features that allow two or more optima . In a broader sense , our results are potentially relevant to all macromolecular interactions , particularly in the presence of a polar solvent such as water that can contribute to bridging interactions , whose contributions to the enthalpy and entropy of binding are in the same order of magnitude . Therefore , in addition to explaining the observed epistasis in protein-DNA interactions , the presence of two optima is likely to also explain the molecular mechanisms behind other types of genetic epistasis . 3 Materials and methods Expression and purification of the DNA-binding domain fragment of human HOXB13 ( residues 209–283 ) as well as CDX2 ( residues 184–256 ) were performed as described in Refs . ( Savitsky et al . , 2010 ) and ( Yin et al . , 2017 ) . The DNA fragments used in crystallization were obtained as single strand oligos ( Eurofins ) , and annealed in 20 mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 5 ) containing 150 mM NaCl and 0 . 5 mM Tris ( 2-carboxyethyl ) phosphine ( TCEP ) and 5% glycerol . For each complex , the purified and concentrated protein was first mixed with a solution of annealed DNA duplex at a molar ratio 1:1 . 2 and after one hour on ice subjected to the crystallization trials . The crystallization conditions for all complexes were optimized using an in house developed crystal screening kit of different PEGs . Complexes were crystalized in sitting drops by vapor diffusion technique from solution containing 50 mM Tris buffer ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 100 mM MgCl2 , 150 mM KCl , 8% of PEG ( 400 ) and different concentrations of various PEGs . PEG ( 3350 ) was used at 14% for HOXB13-DNATCG and 21–27% ( w/v ) of polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether ( PEGmme ( 5000 ) ) was used in crystallizations of HOXB13 with DNACAA and CDX2 with both DNAs . The data sets were collected at ESRF from a single crystal on beam-lines ID29 ( HOXB13-DNATCG ) and ID23-1 ( HOXB13-DNACAA , and both CDX2 complexes ) , at 100 K using the reservoir solution as cryo-protectant . The data collection strategy was optimized with the program BEST ( Bourenkov and Popov , 2006 ) . Data were integrated with the program XDS ( Kabsch , 2010 ) and scaled with SCALA ( Murshudov et al . , 2011; Winn et al . , 2011 ) . Statistics of data collection are presented in Table 1 . All structures were solved by molecular replacement using program Phaser ( McCoy et al . , 2007 ) as implemented in Phenix ( Adams et al . , 2010 ) and CCP4 ( Winn et al . , 2011 ) with the structure of HOXA9 ( pdb entry 1PUF ) as a search model for HOXB13 and structure of CDX2-DNAmeth ( pdb entry 5LTY ) as a search model for CDX . After the positioning of protein , the density of DNA was clear and the molecule was built manually using COOT ( Emsley et al . , 2010 ) . The rigid body refinement with REFMAC5 was followed by restrain refinement with REFMAC5 , as implemented in CCP4 ( Winn et al . , 2011 ) and Phenix . refine ( Afonine et al . , 2012 ) . The manual rebuilding of the model was done using COOT . The refinement statistics are presented in Table 1 . The first seven amino acids from N-termini and the last seven from C-termini were found disordered and were not built in the maps . The end base pairs of the DNA in HOXB13-DNATCG structure were also found slightly disordered but it was possible to build them to the maps . Figures showing structural representations were prepared using PyMOL ( Schrödinger , 2015 ) . MYF6 and BARHL2 HT-SELEX experiments were performed essentially as described in ( Yin et al . , 2017 ) . The PWM models were generated from cycles 3 , 3 , 4 and 2 of new MYF6 and BARHL2 HT-SELEX reads , and published HT-SELEX reads for HOXB13 ( Yin et al . , 2017 ) and CDX1 ( Methyl-HT-SELEX; Yin et al . , 2017 ) , respectively , using the multinomial ( setting = 1 ) method ( Jolma et al . , 2010 ) with the following seeds: HOXB13 single PWM: NCYMRTAAAAN , TCG: NCTCGTAAAAN , CAA: NCCAATAAAAN; CDX1 single PWM: GYMRTAAAA , TCG: GTCGTAAAA , CAA: GCAATAAAA; MYF6 single PWM: NRWCAGCTGWYN , AA . . . TT flank: NAACAGCTGTTN , GT . . . AC flank: NGTCAGCTGACN; BARHL2 single PWM: NSYTAAWYGNYN , TT: NSYTAATTGNYN , AC: NSYTAAACGKYN . Molecular dynamics simulations were performed for HOXB13 complexed with either DNATCG or DNACAA; the DNA sequence used in the simulations contained nucleotides G5 – C18 from the crystal structure . The CHARMM 36 forcefield ( Best et al . , 2012; Foloppe and MacKerell , Jr . , 2000; Hart et al . , 2012; MacKerell et al . , 1998; MacKerell et al . , 2004 ) and CHARMM program ( Brooks et al . , 2009 ) , with the CHARMM interface to OpenMM ( Friedrichs et al . , 2009 ) to allow the use of NVIDIA graphical processing units ( GPUs ) , were used for all simulations . The starting structure was placed in a cubic solvent box with 8 nm side length containing water ( Jorgensen et al . , 1983 ) and 0 . 15 M NaCl; Na+ ions were then added to neutralize the system . After energy minimization to relax initial strain the systems were heated from 100 K to 300 K over 0 . 1 ns followed by 0 . 3 ns simulation at constant pressure ( 1 bar ) and constant temperature ( 300 K ) , with soft harmonic positional restraints on the protein and DNA atoms . For each complex 3 × 0 . 8 µs production runs were performed using the GPU , with the pressure and temperature maintained at 1 bar and 300 K , respectively , and without the positional restraints . Particle mesh Ewald summation was used to treat the long range electrostatic interactions , using a sixth order cubic spline interpolation for the charge distribution on the 0 . 1 nm spaced grid points , kappa = 0 . 34 . The same 0 . 9 nm cutoff was used for both the direct space part of the PME and for the van der Waals interactions , which were switched to zero from 0 . 8 nm to 0 . 9 nm , and the non-bond list was generated with a 1 . 1 nm cutoff . SHAKE ( Ryckaert et al . , 1977 ) was used to keep the lengths of all covalent X-H bonds fixed , allowing a time-step of 2 fs . In the free energy perturbation calculations ( Zwanzig , 1954 ) we changed the three base pairs in the TCG sequence into those of the CAA sequence using a total of 43 intermediate states , where the order of change was: turn off charges , change Lennard-Jones parameters , turn on charges . In each state , a 10 ns equilibration was followed by 10 ns production . The free energies were calculated using the Bennett Acceptance Ratio method ( Bennett , 1976 ) . The ITC experiments were carried similarly to described in Ref . ( Yin et al . , 2017 ) . Briefly , an ITC200 microcalorimeter ( MicroCal Inc . , Northampton , Massachusetts , USA ) in PSF ( Protein Science Facility at Karolinska Institute , Sweden ) was used to measure binding isotherms of DNAs by direct titration of protein to the cell containing DNA . The measurements were taken at 25°C . Both protein and DNA were prepared in a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES pH 7 . 5 , 300 mM NaCl , 10% glycerol and 2 mM Tris ( 2-carboxyethyl ) phosphine ( TCEP ) . To measure binding affinity , a solution of 0 . 15 mM protein was titrated to 0 . 012–0 . 016 mM solution of DNA . A total of 23 injections were made with 240 s between injections . Each experiment was repeated three times for the reliability of the results . All data were evaluated using the OriginPro 7 . 0 software package ( Microcal ) supplied with the calorimeter . The apparent binding constant Kd , binding enthalpy ∆H and stoichiometry n , together with their corresponding standard deviation ( s . d . ) , were determined by a nonlinear least square fit of the data to standard equations for the binding using a model for one set of independent and identical binding sites as implemented in the package . The entropy and free energy of binding were obtained from the relation ∆G = -RTlnKd = ∆H-T∆S . The atomic coordinates and diffraction data have been deposited to Protein Data Bank with the accession codes 5EDN and 5EEA , for HOXB13-DNATCG and HOXB13-DNACAA , respectively and 6ES3 and 6ES2 for CDX2-DNATCG and CDX2-DNACAA , respectively . All sequence reads are deposited to the European Nucleotide Archive with the study accession number: PRJEB20652"}

However , it has remained largely unclear whether metabolic specialization can similarly occur within a clonal bacterial population . More specifically , it is not clear what functions such specialization could provide and how specialization could be coordinated dynamically . Here , we show that exponentially growing Bacillus subtilis cultures divide into distinct interacting metabolic subpopulations , including one population that produces acetate , and another population that differentially expresses metabolic genes for the production of acetoin , a pH-neutral storage molecule . These subpopulations exhibit distinct growth rates and dynamic interconversion between states . Furthermore , acetate concentration influences the relative sizes of the different subpopulations . These results show that clonal populations can use metabolic specialization to control the environment through a process of dynamic , environmentally-sensitive state-switching .", "plain language summary": "The chemical reactions that occur within a living organism are collectively referred to as its metabolism . Many metabolic reactions produce byproducts that will poison the cells if they are not dealt with: fermenting bacteria , for example , release harmful organic acids and alcohols . How the bacteria respond to these toxins has been most studied at the level of entire microbial populations , meaning the activities of individual cells are effectively “averaged” together . Yet , even two bacteria with the same genes and living in the same environment can behave in different ways . This raises the question: do bacterial populations specialize into distinct subpopulations that play distinct roles when dealing with metabolic products , or do all cells in the community act in unison ? Rosenthal et al . set out to answer this question for a community of Bacillus subtilis , a bacterium that is commonly studied in the laboratory and used for the industrial production of enzymes . The analysis focused on genes involved in fundamental metabolic processes , known as the TCA cycle , which the bacteria use to generate energy and build biomass . The experiments revealed that , even when all the cells are genetically identical , different Bacillus subtilis cells do indeed specialize into metabolic subpopulations with distinct growth rates . Time-lapse movies of bacteria that made fluorescent markers of different colors whenever certain metabolic genes became active showed cells switching different colors on and off , indicating that they switch between metabolic subpopulations . Further biochemical studies and measures of gene activity revealed that the different subpopulations produce and release distinct metabolic products , including toxic byproducts . Notably , the release of these metabolites by one subpopulation appeared to activate other subpopulations within the community . This example of cells specializing into unique interacting metabolic subpopulations provides insight into several fundamental issues in microbiology and beyond . It is relevant to evolutionary biologists , since the fact that fractions of the population can switch in and out of a metabolic state , instead of evolving into several inflexible specialists , may provide an evolutionary advantage in fluctuating natural environments by reducing the risk of extinction . It also has implications for industrial fermentation processes and metabolic engineering , and may help biotechnologists design more efficient ways to harness bacterial metabolism to produce useful products .", "article": "1 Introduction Co-utilization of carbon sources was described alongside diauxie by Jacques Monod in his PhD thesis ( Monod , 1958 ) , and is common in many organisms ( Peyraud et al . , 2012 ) . In the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis , two preferred carbon sources are co-utilized: glucose and malate ( Kleijn et al . , 2010 ) . When both of these carbon sources are available they are consumed simultaneously , generating growth rates that surpass those achieved with either substrate alone ( Kleijn et al . , 2010 ) . Under conditions of rapid growth , co-consumption of glucose and malate leads to the accumulation of high levels of acetate ( Kleijn et al . , 2010 ) . As a weak organic acid , acetate can be harmful to cells even in buffered medium ( Rosenthal et al . , 2008 ) . Acetate and related short-chain fatty acids enter the cell passively in the neutral form and then dissociate intracellularly , releasing a proton and transiently acidifying the cytoplasm ( Russell and Diez-Gonzalez , 1997; Roe et al . , 1998 ) . The intracellular dissociation of acetate also disrupts the cellular anion balance , with negative effects on metabolism ( Roe et al . , 1998; Roe et al . , 2002 ) and transcription ( Rosenthal et al . , 2008 ) . When extracellular acetate levels rise to toxic levels the growing Bacillus subtilis culture consumes the acetate and produces acetoin , a non-toxic pH-neutral overflow metabolite that can be used as a carbon source in later growth stages ( Speck and Freese , 1973 ) ( Figure 1A ) . A biphasic growth strategy , in which acetate is produced to a toxic level and then reabsorbed and replaced by a non-toxic metabolite ( Wolfe , 2005 ) , is common to many bacterial species and is important both for understanding the basic biology of bacterial growth in culture , and for applications in metabolic engineering ( Papagianni , 2012 ) . However , it has generally been studied only at the population level , implicitly assuming a homogeneous progression of the entire culture from acetate producing to acetate detoxifying states . By contrast , single cell approaches suggest that bacterial populations can exhibit enormous heterogeneity in functional and gene expression states ( Eldar et al . , 2009; Locke et al . , 2011; Süel et al . , 2006; Levine et al . , 2012; Davidson and Surette , 2008; Dubnau and Losick , 2006; Gefen and Balaban , 2009 ) . This prompts the questions of whether microbial cells differentiate into metabolically distinct subpopulations , and more specifically , whether acetate production and detoxification might occur in distinct cells specializing in acetate production or detoxification , respectively . 2 Results To address these questions we constructed a library of strains with reporters for key genes involved in central carbon metabolism , acetate production , and organic acid detoxification ( Figure 1A ) . We introduced a fluorescent protein ( YFP ) under the control of promoters for 13 different metabolic genes and stably incorporated them into the commonly used sacA site within the genome ( Supplementary file 1 ) , ( Eldar et al . , 2009; Locke et al . , 2011 ) . We chose to use fluorescent promoter reporters because they allow acquisition of dynamic measurements from individual living cells , are easy to construct and integrate into the B . subtilis genome , allow for analysis of multiple genes within the same cell , and can be used in fluorescence cell sorting for RNAseq experiments . Using quantitative single-cell fluorescence microscopy , we analyzed the distribution of expression levels of these 13 metabolic genes in individual cells at different times along the growth curve in buffered culture medium containing 22 mM glucose and 50 mM malate . To eliminate oxygen gradients , 10 mL cultures were grown in 250 mL flasks with rapid shaking ( 250 RPM ) . Four genes had expression levels that were at or near background and were not considered further ( acoA , gntZ , pycA , sdhC ) . Most of the genes showed unimodal distributions ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) , with relatively little skew ( less than ±0 . 7 ) . Two genes , sucC and alsS , encoding succinate co-A ligase and acetolactate synthase , respectively , were more heterogeneous ( Figure 1B ) . We observed skew values greater than 1 ( 4 . 72 and 1 . 14 , respectively ) with 3 . 8% of PsucC-YFP and 8 . 1% of PalsS-YFP cells exhibiting high expression levels ( ≥2 standard deviations above the mean ) at OD600 ~0 . 8 ( sucC ) and OD600 ~2 ( alsS ) . In addition , for both genes , we observed cells whose expression exceeded the mean by >3 fold . While gene expression distribution can be broader immediately after gene activation than at steady-state ( Shahrezaei and Swain , 2008 ) , both sucC and alsS maintained heterogeneous expression for several hours after the onset of expression . For these reasons , we decided to focus on these two genes for further study . To better understand when this heterogeneity emerges in batch culture , we performed a time course analysis of the fraction of sucC and alsS positive cells ( cells ≥ 2 standard deviations above the mean were denoted sucC+ and alsS+ , Figure 1C ) . We observed that the subpopulation of sucC+ cells only existed transiently , in mid- to late-exponential phase ( Figure 1C ) , coinciding with the time and culture optical density at which acetate production was observed ( when the time derivative in acetate , that is , the rate of change in acetate concentration , is positive ~150–300 min , Figure 1D ) . This observation suggested that sucC expression could be involved in acetate production . A parallel analysis of alsS expression revealed the opposite behavior , with alsS expression dynamics coinciding with a decrease in acetate and a concomitant increase in acetoin levels ( Figure 1C , D ) . This behavior is generally consistent with the known role of alsS in acetoin production in response to acetate toxicity ( Speck and Freese , 1973 ) . Together , these results show that a dynamic change in acetate and acetoin levels in the culture overlaps with changes in the population fraction of sucC and alsS expressing cells . A role for sucC in acetate production has not been studied previously . To understand the relationship between the subpopulation marked sucC+ and acetate production , we used fluorescence activated cell sorting ( FACS ) of the PsucCYFP reporter strain to sort cells expressing YFP from a SucC promoter at the time of peak acetate levels , and performed RNAseq to compare gene expression profiles ( Figure 2A , Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) . As expected , sucC expression was elevated 2-fold in the sucC+ sorted subpopulation ( blue dot , Figure 2A ) . This is particularly meaningful considering the fact that the fluorescent marker used for sorting is a stable reporter , making it likely that some sorted cells may have high level of fluorescent signal even after exiting the transcriptionally active state . For most genes , we observed a broad correlation in gene expression between the two populations . However , RNAseq analysis with cuffdiff ( Trapnell et al . , 2010 ) and gene set enrichment analysis with GSEA ( Subramanian et al . , 2005 ) showed that genetic competence genes ( Berka et al . , 2002 ) were significantly enriched in the ~300 upregulated genes in the sucC+ subpopulation ( red dots and inset , −2A and supplementary file 2; GSEA p<e-16 ) . The sucC+ population also exhibited increased expression of the phosphate acetyltransferase gene , pta ( green dot , Figure 2A ) , the enzyme that catalyzes the final step in overflow acetate production . Thus , sucC expression marks a distinct gene expression state that could be involved in acetate production . Based on the strong correlation between sucC expression and competence gene expression in the RNAseq results ( Figure 2A ) , we next asked whether the sucC+ population represented the competent state . To analyze the relationship between sucC expression and genetic competence in single cells , we constructed four dual reporter strains , expressing CFP from the sucC promoter and YFP from one of four competence promoters: comG , comK , nucA and rapH ( Berka et al . , 2002; Ogura et al . , 2002 ) . Imaging revealed a clear positive correlation between sucC and the competence genes ( Figure 2B , Figure 2—figure supplement 2 ) . This positive correlation was not general to all metabolic genes , as sucC expression was anti-correlated with pckA ( Figure 2C , Figure 2—figure supplement 3 ) , a gene involved in phosphoenolpyruvate synthesis ( Meyer and Stülke , 2013 ) . We note that pta ( phosphate acetyltransferase gene ) and sucC were previously observed to be up-regulated in the competent state ( Berka et al . , 2002; Ogura et al . , 2002 ) . Together , these results suggest that individual cells can exist in at least two distinct metabolic states , one of which represents genetically competent cells and involves increased expression of sucC and pta , among other genes . We next assessed how competence might be linked to elevated acetate production . The competence system is controlled by a noise-excitable gene circuit that stochastically initiates transient episodes of differentiation in individual cells ( Süel et al . , 2007; Süel et al . , 2006; Cağatay et al . , 2009; Maamar et al . , 2007; Hahn et al . , 1994 ) To better understand the relationship between competence and acetate metabolism , we next asked whether activation of the competence system is necessary for increased sucC expression and acetate metabolism . Strains in which the competence master transcription factor comK is deleted ( Supplementary File 1 ) exhibited greatly reduced acetate production ( Figure 2D ) and a loss of sucC as well as comG expression ( Figure 2—figure supplement 4 ) . In addition to the reduced level of acetate itself , expression of pta , the key step in acetate production , is greatly diminished in strains in which comK is deleted , both in our conditions ( Figure 2—figure supplement 4B ) and also in data from previous microarray experiments ( Ogura et al . , 2002; Berka et al . , 2002 ) . Although the competent state has been suggested to be involved in other functions , such as attachment , motility , antibiotic resistance , and DNA metabolism ( Redfield , 1993; Hahn et al . , 2015; Bakkali , 2013; Finkel and Kolter , 2001 ) , a role in central carbon metabolism has not been reported . These results indicate that the sucC subpopulation is controlled by the competence system , linking competence both to an alternative metabolic state and to the control of acetate levels in culture . To better understand the dynamics with which cells switch into the competent state and later into the alsS+ state , we used the ‘Mother Machine’ microfluidic device ( Figure 3A ) , to conduct long-term analysis of individual cells over tens of cell generations under chemostatic conditions ( Wang et al . , 2010; Norman et al . , 2013 ) . We set up the Mother Machine as described previously ( Norman et al . , 2013 ) , but cultured cells with conditioned media obtained from batch growth of B . subtilis cultures at different final optical densities . Specifically , we used media from cultures at OD600 0 . 8 and OD600 2 . 0 , points during the peak of sucC+ or alsS+ expression , respectively . This approach provides the simplicity of long-term chemostatic analysis with the ability to compare cellular behavior at different culture time-points . Using the Mother Machine , we analyzed cell lineages for up to 4 days ( approximately 60 generations ) for a total of 1 , 400 cell generations ( Figure 3B ) . We tabulated the number of activation events per hour occurring in the terminal ( top ) cell of each channel , as well as the length of time that cells remained in an activated state ( dwell time ) . Finally , we also measured the length of cells through successive frames of the movie , to obtain the mean relative elongation rates of alsS+ and alsS- cells ( Materials and Methods ) . With sucC-inducing media ( conditioned at OD 0 . 8 ) , we observed rare episodes of sucC activation in some cells , lasting for approximately four hours each ( 252 ± 89 min , mean ±standard deviation for n = 31 events ) ( Figure 3B , left ) . Consistent with previous analysis of competence dynamics ( Süel et al . , 2006 ) , sucC+ cells divided less frequently and grew more slowly than other cells in the same movies ( elongation rates of 47 . 4 ± 2 . 7 %/hr and 67 . 7 ± 2 . 3 %/hr , respectively ) . Cells in the activated state could switch out of the sucC+ state and resume normal growth rates ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 , Video 1 ) . Under these conditions , we did not observe activation of alsS expression . By contrast , in the OD 2 . 0 conditioned media we did not observe activation of sucC expression , but did observe frequent pulses of alsS gene expression . alsS+ cells grew at a slightly reduced elongation rate ( 63 ± 2 . 6 %/hr increase compared to 74 ± 2 . 3 %/hr for alsS- cells , Figure 3B , right panel , Video 2 ) . Together , these results provide rates of transitions into the sucC+ ( competent ) and alsS+ gene expression states , and show that these states have altered growth rates and respond to medium composition . These results further suggested the possibility that acetate predominantly produced by sucC+ cells early in the growth could induce cell switching to the alsS+ state in later growth stages , when it accumulates to toxic levels . However , many media components could differ between the OD600 0 . 8 and OD600 2 . 0 cultures . To determine whether acetate was sufficient to affect alsS expression , we cultured reporter cells in varying levels of acetate , in unconditioned liquid medium , and quantified the fraction of alsS+ cells . We observed both a systematic increase in the distribution of alsS expression levels , and in the fraction of cells in the high expressing ‘tail’ of the distribution ( Figure 3C ) . The Mother Machine is ideal for analyzing cells over multiple generations in a relatively constant environment but not ideal for analyzing responses to environmental changes that happen as a consequence of growth . We therefore designed microcolony pad experiments in which acetate was added to standard microcolony medium ( Eldar et al . , 2009; Locke et al . , 2011; Young et al . , 2011 ) to 20 mM , the acetate concentration present in mid-exponential phase ( Figure 1D ) ( Speck and Freese , 1973 ) . In these experiments ( Figure 4 ) , all cells started with a low growth rate , likely owing to the initial acetate present in the growth media . As cells divided , approximately half of the population switched on high levels of alsS expression within 7 to 10 hr ( Figure 4 , Figure 4—figure supplement 1 , Videos 3–5 ) . As growth progressed , these alsS+ cells exhibited a reduced growth rate , similar to that of the original culture . However , a distinct subpopulation with approximately 2 . 5-fold lower alsS expression emerged ( alsS- ) , becoming greater than 70% of the population . These cells exhibited a faster division rate ( Figure 4B , Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) and faster elongation rate ( Figure 4C , Figure 4—figure supplement 2 ) . The fast growing alsS- cells that appeared late in pad growth experiments had a large growth advantage compared to the slow growing alsS+ cells ( median elongation rates of 65 %/hr and 20 %/hr , respectively ) . In general , growth in the chemostatic Mother Machine using conditioned media is faster than on a pad with non-conditioned media containing acetate . However , the difference between alsS- and alsS+ cells is much smaller in the microfluidic condition ( 74 %/hr vs 63 %/hr for alsS- and alsS+ ) . This finding is consistent with the established role of acetoin as a molecule secreted to counter the pH and anion producing toxic effect of secreted short chain fatty acids , including acetate ( Xiao and Xu , 2007; Speck and Freese , 1973 ) . In the pad environment , transient activation of genes for the production of the pH-protective acetoin in the alsS+ cells has the potential to produce a milder growth environment which may enable other cells to grow faster ( Figure 4D ) . By contrast , in the mother-machine experiments ( Figure 3 ) , while cells switch in and out of the alsS metabolic state , the chemostatic nature of the device minimizes their ability to impact the growth rates of their neighbors . To test the idea that alsS+ cells can enhance the growth of alsS- cells by influencing the extracellular environment , we seeded petri plates with equal numbers of cells from either wild-type or ∆alsS B . subtilis strains . The wildtype strain produced larger colonies than the deletion strain ( Figure 4—figure supplement 3 ) . However , ΔalsS colonies plated next to wildtype colonies exhibited a distinct growth advantage compared to the same colonies plated further away from the wildtype strain ( Figure 4—figure supplement 3 ) , indicating that alsS+ cells ( in the wildtype colony ) alter the growth environment to benefit ΔalsS cells . This may occur through detoxification by alsS+ cells ( consistent with the role of alsS in the literature ) . However , our data do not rule out alternative scenarios in which alsS+ cells provide this benefit through a distinct mechanism , for example by the secretion of a shared metabolite or co-factor . 3 Discussion The natural metabolic niches in soil occupied by B . subtilis are not well understood , and likely heterogeneous . In general , growth of soil organisms is typically highest near deposits of organic materials which serve as carbon and nitrogen sources , including deposits of rotting fruits and vegetation . In many fruits and vegetables both organic acids ( including malic acid ) and sugars are very high , providing a natural setting where B . subtilis has access to its two preferred carbon sources simultaneously . B subtilis is commonly enriched ( almost to levels of purity ) in traditional fermentation of certain foods , including fermented soy-bean foods ( eg natto ) that are common in Asia ( Kubo et al . , 2011 ) . In these beans sugar is present , and malic acid is also present in the root system of legumes and in soybean exudate , where it plays a role in iron homeostasis as a metal chelating agent ( Tiffin and Brown , 1962 ) . The ‘acetate switch’ refers to the accumulation and reabsorption of acetate . It is a classic hallmark of bacterial growth in aerobic conditions , common to many bacteria including B . subtilis and E . coli ( Wolfe , 2005 ) . It allows for rapid initial growth until acetate levels and associated acidity reach toxic levels , at which point acetate is reabsorbed and replaced with pH-neutral overflow metabolites such as acetoin ( Wolfe , 2005; Speck and Freese , 1973 ) . Growth strategies in which a preferred toxic overflow metabolite is produced under aerobic conditions are also used by other organisms that expel and control different fermented toxic overflow metabolites , including ethanol fermentation by yeast ( Otterstedt et al . , 2004 ) and lactic acid in lactobacillus species ( Borch and Molin , 1989 ) . Interestingly , in the fermentation of ethanol by the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , ethanol is produced in dynamic bursts in which some cells switch in and out of fermentative metabolism . These bursts can be synchronized in chemostat growth ( Tu et al . , 2005 ) , but also appear in batch culture ( Silverman et al . , 2010 ) . In yeast , the single cell dynamics , mechanisms , and role of these bursts have not been fully elucidated . However , the presence of metabolically specialized subpopulations of cells in both eukaryotes and bacteria suggests that segregating different fermentative or respiratory pathways into individual cells may be a general strategy . It could function to avoid metabolic incompatibilities ( Brandriss and Magasanik , 1981; Ackermann , 2015; Kumar et al . , 2010 ) , controlling cellular challenges such as reducing potential ( Liu et al . , 2017 ) , or to optimize enzyme and substrate scaling , in which locally high concentrations of enzymes and substrates may be needed for efficient enzymatic conversion to occur ( Nikel et al . , 2014; Ackermann , 2015 ) . Better understanding of the principles that govern segregation of metabolic activities will facilitate metabolic engineering and industrial fermentation approaches . This is especially true for commonly used industrial strains which naturally produce multiple fermentation products . For example , E . coli strains simultaneously produce five different fermentation products during mixed-acid fermentation ( Clark , 1989 ) . The rapid release of toxic overflow products also has a role in the context of competition within a multi-species environment . In such environments , a quick buildup of toxic products can be advantageous to ward off competing species . In the case of human infectious disease , the buildup of byproducts such as lactic acid from normal microbiota limits infection by pathogens that are not lactic acid specialists ( O'Hanlon et al . , 2013 ) . Likewise , in industrial fermenters and microbial food fermentation secreted overflow metabolites , including acetate and ethanol , limit contamination . Additionally , if a particular metabolic niche is transient , as in the case of acetate production in B . subtilis colony growth or batch culture , a strategy in which cells can switch in and out of metabolic states can be advantageous relative to an alternative scenario in which multiple strains are evolutionarily ‘locked’ into distinct specialist roles . This is especially true if the metabolic niche ( e . g . acetate ) is short-lived , because a ‘locked’ specialist strain would be at a disadvantage during periods of growth when acetate is absent . In this study , we linked the presence of extracellular acetate with the activation of alsS in a subset of cells . In the case of competence and sucC , which are both controlled by the master regulator comK , quorum sensing plays a critical role in the activation of the competence program ( Dubnau , 1991 ) . Maximizing competence requires specific media conditions ( Dubnau , 1982 ) , raising the possibility that alongside quorum sensing peptides , secreted metabolic byproducts also play a role in this process . Our results reveal that several metabolic processes may be affiliated with a given subpopulation . For instance , it is not clear at this point how sucC is related to acetate metabolism . One possible connection between sucC expression and acetate production might be that during co-consumption of glucose and malate , the TCA cycle may be overloaded with incoming material , causing accumulation of intermediates that can impact the glycolytic pathway , including acetate secretion . Another possibility is that sucC is used to regulate coenzyme-A levels at a time when a large amount of coenzyme-A is used and freed when pyruvate is converted to acetyl-coA and then acetate . Additionally , alongside the roles of the sucC and pta metabolic genes , arginine metabolism genes are also differentially regulated by competence , as seen in our results and in prior microarray experiments ( Berka et al . , 2002; Ogura et al . , 2002 ) , further complicating our understanding of the full physiological role of this subpopulation . Tools to systematically study metabolites in single cells would help to map the actual metabolic states of each subpopulation in a given condition and will allow us to address these questions . Going beyond microbial systems , cell-cell heterogeneity can be advantageous as a ‘bet-hedging’ strategy both for microbial and cancer cells ( Veening et al . , 2008 ) . In such cases , cell-cell heterogeneity enables the population as a whole to withstand unforeseen challenges , such as antibiotic or chemotherapeutic drugs ( Sharma et al . , 2010; Rotem et al . , 2010 ) , or metabolic shifts ( Solopova et al . , 2014 ) . By contrast to simple bet-hedging , the emergence of alsS+ acetoin producing populations described here arises as a response to an anticipated challenge that is part of the growth progression in conditions favoring weak organic acid production . Thus , unlike in bet-hedging , metabolic state switching could provide a predictable benefit in a more deterministic dynamic environment . 4 Materials and methods Plasmids for the integration of fluorescent reporters were made as previously reported ( Eldar et al . , 2009 ) . YFP promoter reporters were cloned into the ECE174 backbone plasmid which uses sacA integration site and encodes chloramphenicol resistance ( R . Middleton , obtained from the Bacillus Genetic Stock Center ) . CFP promoter reporters were cloned into the pDL30 backbone which uses amyE integration sites and encodes spectinomycin resistance ( obtained from the Bacillus Genetic Stock Center ) . A constitutive RFP reporter , using a minimal sigA promoter , was used for image segmentation as previously reported ( Locke et al . , 2011 ) . pAZR1: ( Pcggr:alsS/D ) is a plasmid for the integration of a constitutive promoter ( cggr promoter ) to drive the constitutive expression of the alsS/D regulon from its native site . The plasmid was constructed by Gibson cloning ( Gibson et al . , 2009 ) . A markerless deletion of alsS/D was made using the alsS/D strain of the BKE collection and the pdr244 plasmid , both obtained from the BGSC , followed by selection . All strains were made by genomic integration into the genome . Fluorescent reporters were integrated into either the sacA ( YFP ) or the amyE ( CFP ) loci as previously described ( Locke et al . , 2011 ) . A constitutive RFP color was utilized , relying on constitutive expression of a partial ptrpE promoter reporter driving mCherry expression , which was inserted into the ppsB locus as previously ( Locke et al . 2011b ) . Non chaining strains for microfluidic mother-machine experiments used a lytF overexpression construct as previously reported . Strain information is included as Supplementary file 1 . Strains were started from glycerol stocks and grown in M9 minimal media prepared according to the directions of the manufacturer ( BD – difco , Franklin Lakes NJ ) . Base media was supplemented with 0 . 4% glucose ( 22 mM ) and a cocktail of trace metals ( Leadbetter et al . , 1999 ) 50 mM Malate ( 0 . 66% ) was added to growing cultures at OD 0 . 4–0 . 5 as per previous publications ( Buescher et al . 2012; Kleijn et al . , 2010 ) to facilitate comparison of results between our studies and other published work . Samples for fluorescence microscopy were prepared using agarose pads for either snapshot analysis ( timepoint measurements ) or pad movies , as previously described by our laboratory ( Young et al . 2011b ) . Images were acquired using a Nikon inverted TI‐E microscope via a coolsnap HQ2 camera . Commercially available software ( Metamorph ) controlled the stage , microscope , camera , and shutters . Fluorescent illumination was provided by a Sola Light Engine LED source ( Lumencor ) . Temperature was kept at 37°C using an enclosed microscope chamber ( Nikon ) attached to a temperature sensitive heat exchanger . All experiments used a Phase 100x Plan Apo ( NA 1 . 4 ) objective . Filter sets used were Chroma #41027 ( mCh ) , Chroma #41028 ( YFP ) , and Chroma #31044 v2 ( CFP ) . Media was collected from growing cultures by centrifuging 500 ul culture samples at 5000 g for 2 min and filtering the supernatant in 0 . 2 uM syringe filters . Clarified conditioned media samples were placed into glass sample vials and run at the Caltech environmental analysis center using an Aminex HPX-87H column ( Bio-Rad , Rockville NY ) in an Agilent 1100 HPLC with UV and Refractive Index detectors with elution using 0 . 013 N H2SO4 at ambient temperature and 36 ml/hour flow as described in ( Leadbetter et al . , 1999 ) . Standards of acetate and acetoin were prepared in uninoculated growth media , and diluted to produce a standard curve . Microfluidic experiments used the mothermachine devices described in ( REFS Wang Jun 2010; Norman Losick 2013 ) . SU80 wafers were made based on masks provided by the Losick lab . PDMS devices were prepared by pouring degassed Sylgard 184 PDMS silicone ( corning corporation , Corning NY ) onto wafers and curing the molds for a minimum of 8 hr at 65°C . Cured PDMS devices were bonded onto microscopy coverslips ( 60 × 22 mm , Gold Seal coverslips Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham MA ) by plasma cleaning . Plasma bonding was done in a PDC32G plasma cleaner ( Harrick Plasma Ithaca , NY ) set to chamber pressure between 600–700 microns . Coverslips were cleaned separately for 1 min , and then the devices and coverslips were cleaned jointly for 20 s . Device bonding was immediately done by inverting the plasma treated device onto the treated coverslips . After bonding the devices were cured for an additional 4 hr at 65°C . Devices were kept for up to 2 weeks in the dark at room temperature . Before use , holes for inlet and outlet were punched using a biopsy punch and each device was passivated by loading the channels using growth-media containing 1 mg/ml BSA using a handheld micro-pippete and a 20 uM tip . Cells were loaded by flowing a concentrated cell culture ( OD 2 . 0 ) and letting cells reach the growth chambers by waiting for 30 min . Devices were placed on an inverted Nikon TiE microscope and growth media was flowed using syringe pumps set to a flow rate of 50–100 ul per hour . Media used in microfluidic mother machine experiments was conditioned media taken from batch growth cultures . Media for the sucC/competence experiments contained media conditioned by growth on glucose/malate media until OD 0 . 8 . Conditioned media used for alsS movies was from OD 2 . 0 . Fluorescent Images were captured using a CoolSnap HQ2 and analyzed with custom MATLAB software ( Rosenthal , 2018; copy archived at https://github . com/elifesciences-publications/Schnitzcells_2018 ) and in imageJ . Events were followed for the terminal ‘mother’ cell position in each channel of each device , and were manually counted to provide the events per hour . Dwell time was determined by counting the number of frames from activation ( passing the fluorescence threshold ) and deactivation , and converted to hours and minutes by multiplying the number of frames by the frame rate of the movie . Elongation rates were measured by quantifying the length of at least 50 cells in either the activated or non-active state per each movie ( at least three movies per condition ) , and calculated as previously determined ( Young et al . , 2011 ) . Cultures of cells expressing YFP under the control of sucC ( strain AZRE1 ) were grown in M9 glucose-malate media . Cells in mid log phase ( OD 0 . 8 ) were fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature . Fixed cells were washed twice in Tris pH 7 , and gently filtered using a 5 . 0 uM filter to remove clumps and chains . Cells were sorted on either a MoFlo astrios cell sorter or a BSfacsARIA in the USC medical school sorting facility . Cells sorted for either high YFP fluorescence or regular fluorescence ( a minimum of 200 , 000 cells ) were collected into tubes containing RNA protect ( Qiagen , Hilden , Germany ) . Sorted samples were centrifuged and cells were rehydrated in 240 ul qiagen PKD buffer ( FFPE miRNEASY kit , Qiagen ) . Cells were lysed by the addition of 10 ul lysosome solution for 10 min followed by bead beating for 2 min in high setting . Samples were further processed using the qiagen FFPE miRNA kit . Libraries were prepared using the Epicentre Scriptseq V2 kit , follow the directions for highly fragmented DNA . Libraries were sequenced at the Caltech Millard and Muriel Jacobs sequencing facility . Analysis followed the standard Galaxy RNAseq workflow ( grooming , trimming , bowtie mapping , and cuff-diff and cuff-links ) ( Afgan et al . , 2016 ) . Agarose pad experiments were done as previously described ( Young et al . , 2011 ) , with the following exceptions: Cells were spotted on agarose pads made with standard pad movie media ( Young et al . , 2011 ) which is a Spizizen’s minimal media with 0 . 4% glucose to which acetate was added to a final concentration of 20 mM , to mimic acetate concentrations at mid exponential phase . Cells were allowed to acclimate to the agarose pad growth condition for ∼2 hr , before the start of imaging . Images were acquired from multiple fields every 12 min for a total of 22 hr . Movie analysis was performed in Matlab using the Schnitzcells analysis package ( Young et al . , 2011 ) with slight edits . The current version of this analysis package is available at http://www . elowitz . caltech . edu"}

Here we identify ligands that inhibit amyloid formation by stabilizing the Mcg light chain variable domain dimer and shifting the equilibrium away from the amyloid-prone monomer .", "plain language summary": "Systemic light chain amyloidosis is a disease that occurs when individuals produce too much of an immune protein . The excess protein chains normally exist in the body as individual molecules called “monomers” or in pairs called “dimers , ” and they can readily switch between these two forms . However , the monomers are also prone to forming amyloid fibrils , which are difficult to break down . Amyloid fibrils are often deposited in the heart and kidneys and can lead to organ failure and death . Finding molecules that prevent the formation of amyloid fibrils could help to develop treatments for amyloidosis . Now , Brumshtein , Esswein et al . have screened 27 compounds to identify those that stabilize the dimer form of the protein . This would reduce the number of monomers in the body , and so reduce the number of immune proteins that can form amyloid fibrils . The experiments identified four compounds that could stabilize the dimers , including one called methylene blue . Comparing the chemical structures of these compounds with the structures of drugs approved for medical use identified thirteen drugs . However , follow-up tests showed that only one , called sulfasalazine , reduced the formation of amyloid fibrils . Neither methylene blue nor sulfasalazine is likely to have a strong enough effect to treat amyloidosis , but they may serve as templates for future drug designs .", "article": "1 Introduction Amyloid fibrils are protein deposits often associated with disease . These deposits show common structural and biochemical characteristics , including non-covalent self-complementary fibrils , resistance to proteolysis , insolubility in aqueous solution , binding of thioflavin dye , and generation of a cross-β X-ray diffraction pattern . The spine of amyloid fibrils , termed a 'steric zipper , ' is built by paired β-sheets with interdigitating side chains and serves as the scaffold for fibril extension . The inter-strand and inter-sheet distances give rise to a characteristic cross-β X-ray diffraction pattern of two perpendicular reflections at ~4 . 8 and ~10 Å ( Geddes et al . , 1968; Hobbs , 1973; Sipe and Cohen , 2000; Nelson et al . , 2005 ) . Formation of a steric zipper requires the presence of a discrete peptide segment with an amino acid sequence capable of forming a self-complimentary propagating structure . Such segments are commonly found as integral parts of globular proteins and trigger aggregation into amyloid fibrils only upon exposure to solvent through full or partial denaturation ( Nelson et al . , 2005 ) . Cases of systemic light chain amyloidosis ( AL ) , associated with multiple myeloma , were first described in the mid-19th century; however , the etiology of the disease was not clear . In 1848 , Dr . Bence-Jones discovered the disease-associated substance in urine , though it was only later identified as immunoglobulin light chains ( LC ) associated with amyloidosis ( Kyle , 2001; 2011; Dahlin and Dockerty , 1950; Glenner et al . , 1970; 1971; Glenner , 1973; Sipe et al . , 2014 ) . Systemic AL amyloidosis is characterized by overexpression of monoclonal LCs , which are able to form homo-dimers . Despite renal clearance of excess protein , the full-length LCs or their fragments still form amyloid fibril deposits in patients’ tissues , most frequently in the heart and kidneys , which result in organ failure ( Falk et al . , 1997; Buxbaum , 1986 ) . Although it is clear this deposition causes organ dysfunction , much remains to be discovered about the molecular process by which immunoglobulins assemble into amyloid fibrils . It is unknown which peptide segments form steric zippers and how to block their assembly into the amyloid spine . LCs are produced by plasma cells and their final amino acid sequence is determined by somatic recombination ( Sakano et al . , 1979; Marchalonis and Schluter , 1989 ) . LCs are classified by their amino acid sequence as either κ or λ . They consist of two domains , the variable ( VL ) and constant ( CL ) , which are connected by a joining segment ( J ) . In patients , amyloid fibrils are found to include either VLs or full-length LCs ( VL-J-CL ) , yet the ubiquitous presence of VLs indicates that this domain may be the minimal and essential unit for fibril assembly ( Falk et al . , 1997; Buxbaum , 1986; 1992; Olsen et al . , 1998; Lavatelli et al . , 2008; Vrana et al . , 2009; Bodi et al . , 2009 ) . The crystal structures of full-length LCs and structures of just their VLs both reveal homo-dimers , which resemble the light chain and heavy chain hetero-dimer of the antigen-binding fragment ( Fab ) of a full antibody . Fab is a hetero-dimer composed of both light and heavy chains , each with constant ( CL and CH ) and variable ( VL and VH ) immunoglobulin domains . LC homo-dimers , in which the VL domain is covalently linked to the CL domain , resemble the quaternary structure of the Fab hetero-dimer , and non-covalently linked dimers of only VLs structurally resemble the variable region of the Fab ( VL and VH ) ( Edmundson et al . , 1969; Colman et al . , 1977; Firca et al . , 1978 ) . The interfaces between the variable domains of physiological hetero-dimers and pathological homo-dimers are lined with apolar residues encompassing a hydrophobic cavity capable of accommodating small molecules ( Edmundson et al . , 1984; 1993 ) . Our work focuses on a λ patient-derived VL homo-dimer named Mcg whose structure and properties were detailed in pioneering studies by Edmundson and coworkers ( Edmundson et al . , 1969; 1984; 1993; Firca et al . , 1978 ) . The cavity between the two VL domains in Mcg is capable of binding a wide array of ligands , including synthetic organic molecules and peptides , which form contacts with the side chains of the dimer cavity . The cavity spans most of the 24 Å-long dimer interface; it is cylindrically shaped and can be considered to constitute three sites: A , B and C ( Edmundson et al . , 1984 ) . Based on the geometry of the dimer with some deviation from the original nomenclature by Edmundson et al . , we designate side chains of residues Y34 , Y93 , D97 and F99 on one side of the cylindrical cavity as the 'A-site , ' S36 , Y51 , E52 , S91 and F101 as the 'B-site , ' and Y38 , Q40 , V48 and Y89 as the 'C-site' ( Figure 1 ) . Some ligands bind the cavity in a sequential manner without a distinct preference for one of the sites . For example , 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid binds in either the A or C-sites and can migrate between them , whereas fluorescein binds to both sites with partial occupancy . Other molecules , such as menadione , preferentially bind to only one of the sites ( Edmundson et al . , 1984 ) . Regardless of binding location , this demonstrates the dimer cavity is capable of accommodating various hydrophobic and aromatic ligands . 10 . 7554/eLife . 10935 . 003Figure 1 . Stereo image of the ligand-binding sites of the VL dimer . We designate the A-site in red ( residues Y34 , Y93 , D97 and F99 ) , B-site in yellow ( residues S36 , Y51 , E52 , S91 and F101 ) , and C-site in green ( residues Y38 , Q40 , V48 and Y89 ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 10935 . 003 VLs exist in equilibrium between homo-dimers and amyloid-prone monomers . Experiments conducted in denaturing conditions indicate that reducing the stability of the monomeric state promotes amyloid fibril formation , and mutations that induce dimer disassociation or promote monomer unfolding increase the propensity to form amyloid fibrils ( Bernier and Putnam , 1963; Kishida et al . , 1975; Qin et al . , 2007; Wetzel , 1994; Hurle et al . , 1994; Brumshtein et al . , 2014; Baden et al . , 2008 ) . Likewise , mutations that stabilize the structure of VLs or covalently fix VL dimers inhibit formation of amyloid fibrils . These results indicate that formation of amyloid fibrils involves two steps: VL dimer disassociation into monomers followed by partial or full unfolding . The mechanism of amyloid formation also suggests that shifting the equilibrium away from the amyloid-prone monomer by stabilizing the dimer would hinder formation of amyloid fibrils ( Figure 2 ) ( Bulawa et al . , 2012; Bellotti et al . , 2000 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 10935 . 004Figure 2 . Proposed mechanism for using ligands to hinder the aggregation of immunoglobulin VL s into amyloid fibrils . VL s are in equilibrium between dimers and monomers in solution . Ligands may be used to stabilize the VL dimer and therefore shift the equilibrium away from amyloid-prone monomers . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 10935 . 004 The monomer-dimer equilibrium of VLs suggests that systemic AL amyloidosis may be mitigated by binding ligands to the cavity at the VL dimer interface ( Figure 2 ) . This approach proved effective for transthyretin-related amyloidosis , another type of systemic amyloidosis for which stabilizing the quaternary state led to the development of therapeutics ( Miroy et al . , 1996 ) . Upon transthyretin tetramer disassociation into amyloid-prone monomers , it forms amyloid fibrils in an acidic environment . The binding of thyroxine inhibits disassociation and subsequent amyloid formation ( Baures et al . , 1998 ) . Following the same principle , a modified ligand with a disassociation constant in the nano-molar range prevents transthyretin from forming amyloid fibrils and is effective in vivo . Here we apply structural and biochemical methods to investigate ligands that hinder amyloid formation by stabilizing the VL homo-dimer . We identify ligands that may serve as prototypes for therapies for treating LC amyloidosis and our results are consistent with a mechanism for amyloidosis that proceeds via dimer disassociation to amyloid-prone monomers ( Qin et al . , 2007; Brumshtein et al . , 2014 ) . 2 Results Identification of ligands that inhibit formation of amyloid fibrils . Based on the previous work of Edmundson et al . , we screened a panel of 27 hydrophobic and aromatic ligands for an inhibitory effect on the formation of amyloid fibrils ( Figure 3 ) ( Edmundson et al . , 1976; 1984; 1993 ) . Such ligands may stabilize VL dimers and decrease disassociation into amyloid-prone monomers . Varying concentrations of ligands up to 1 mM were used to evaluate the effect of complexes on formation of amyloid fibrils . Formation of amyloid fibrils was monitored using both ThT fluorescence assays and EM micrographs . Molecules that showed an inhibitory effect with concentrations under 1 mM were 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonic acid [5] , methylene blue [10] , Chicago Sky Blue 6B [14] and Phenol Red [20] ( Figure 3B ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 10935 . 005Figure 3 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 10935 . 005 Methylene blue , Chicago Sky Blue 6B , and Phenol Red ( 10 , 14 and 20 ) were used to search DrugBank for approved biomedical compounds resembling their chemical structures and properties with a similarity threshold value of 0 . 3 ( Law et al . , 2014 ) . The search identified 13 compounds that were tested for an amyloid inhibitory effect by means of ThT assays and EM analysis ( Figure 3C ) . Of these 13 molecules from DrugBank , only sulfasalazine [34] showed an inhibitory effect on formation of amyloid fibrils . Among all the molecules tested , including the ligands initially screened and the subsequent approved biomedical compounds , the two that show the most potent effect are methylene blue [10] and sulfasalazine [34]; both hinder amyloid fibril formation at effective concentrations of 0 . 1 and 0 . 5 mM respectively ( Figure 4 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 10935 . 006Figure 4 .

( B ) Mcg with various concentrations of methylene blue . ( C ) Mcg with various concentrations of sulfasalazine . As the concentration of ligand is increased , the ability of VLs to form amyloid fibrils is hindered , as indicated by a decrease in ThT assay fluorescence and inability to detect fibrils with EM . The ligand concentration that effectively inhibited amyloid formation in these assays was 500 μM for methylene blue and 250 μM for sulfasalazine . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 10935 . 006 Equilibrium dialysis binding of methylene blue and sulfasalazine . Equilibrium dialysis was used to assess the binding constants of methylene blue and sulfasalazine to Mcg . Measured concentrations were fit to the corresponding model equations and their curves were represented as binding and Scatchard plots ( Figure 5 ) ( Scatchard , 1949; Spitzer and McDonald , 1956 ) . The constants were derived from a least squares fit of equations to data and are given in Table 1 . Although both methylene blue and sulfasalazine bind to Mcg , the Scatchard plots indicate that binding proceeds through somewhat different pathways: methylene blue shows positive cooperative binding , signifying at least two sites with different binding constants , while sulfasalazine shows no cooperativity and suggests an additional , non-specific binding site ( Figure 5 ) . The best fit for the sulfasalazine-binding data was achieved using a model for two identical , independent binding sites per VL dimer , followed by non-specific binding . 10 . 7554/eLife . 10935 . 007Figure 5 .

We used analytical ultracentrifugation to assess whether ligand binding shifts the equilibrium of Mcg towards more dimers or whether ligands bind to monomers as well . The wavelengths used for optical density readings of methylene blue ( 550 nm ) and sulfasalazine ( 420 nm ) did not overlap with protein absorbance . Distributions of molecular weights were fit to the absorbance data , thus permitting detection of only the apparent molecular weights of the protein in complex with ligand ( Figure 7 , Table 3 ) . The observed molecular weights indicate that ligands bind only to VL dimers . For methylene blue , the measured molecular weight was slightly larger than expected; therefore , we performed an additional ultracentrifugation meniscus depletion experiment to detect possible monomers . The experiment identified no methylene blue bound to VL monomers . 10 . 7554/eLife . 10935 . 011Figure 7 . Analytical ultracentrifugation data for Mcg with methylene blue and Mcg with sulfasalazine .

By utilizing the known ability of ligands to bind the hydrophobic cavity of VL dimers , we prevent dimer disassociation into monomers and thus hinder amyloid formation ( Edmundson et al . , 1984; 1993 ) . A similar approach was used to design therapies for transthyretin-related amyloidosis by stabilizing the tetrameric state of the protein ( Miroy et al . , 1996 ) . Initial screening for ligands that hinder VL amyloid formation revealed four ligands showing this effect , with methylene blue as the strongest binding ligand . A subsequent search in the DrugBank aimed to identify similarly effective ligands that are already approved for medical use . Since the emission spectra of ThT partly overlaps with the absorption spectra of the ligands , both ThT assays and EM analysis were necessary to confirm the ability of the ligands to inhibit amyloid formation . Analysis of electron micrographs and ThT assays indicates that increasing the concentration of methylene blue or sulfasalazine hinders the formation of amyloid fibrils . One of the molecules from our screen , epigallocatechin gallate , was recently suggested to hinder the formation of amyloid fibrils , yet in our experiments it did not show any effect ( Pelaez-Aguilar et al . , 2015 ) . Though both of the ligands bind Mcg and induce amyloid hindering effects , the mechanism of binding slightly differs . Methylene blue binds through positive cooperativity . This result indicates the presence of two binding sites , one strong and one weak , where binding to the second site begins only after the first site is fully occupied . Scatchard plots for sulfasalazine show that the two specific binding sites on Mcg are identical with the same disassociation constant and that this specific ligand binding is followed by non-specific binding . We addressed the difference in the binding mechanisms of methylene blue and sulfasalazine to Mcg in solution by crystal structures and analytical ultracentrifugation . The crystal structure of Mcg with methylene blue shows binding at the A-site of the VL dimer cavity and coordination by the side chains of residues Y34 , Y93 , D97 and F99 . The crystal belongs to space group P21 with one dimer per asymmetric unit , and the symmetry between the two VL domains of Mcg is broken by the presence of a sulfate ion bound to only one of the VL domains ( Figure 6A ) . Analytical ultracentrifugation analysis of the soluble quaternary state indicates the dimer as the most prevalent form of the complex versus monomer without a bound ligand ( Brumshtein et al . , 2014 ) . We also observed a small fraction of oligomers with molecular weights larger than dimers , as confirmed by the meniscus depletion experiment . The meniscus depletion distributes quaternary states along the path length of the sample cell during analytical centrifugation , thus verifying which state accounts for the deviation in apparent molecular weight . The most significant outcome is the complete absence of soluble monomer in complex with the ligand , which verifies our conjecture that the ligands bind and stabilize dimers . In the case of sulfasalazine , to confirm binding specifically to soluble dimers , the analytical ultracentrifugation experiments identified dimers as the only quaternary state of the ligand-bound complex . The reconciliation of our three experiments on the binding of methylene blue to Mcg VLs suggests blocking of the secondary binding site in the crystals . The three experimental findings are: cooperative binding of methylene blue as measured by equilibrium dialysis , binding of the ligand to the A-site in the crystal structure , and the absence of monomeric VL in complex with ligand . Taken together , these observations indicate that the secondary binding site of methylene blue may not be available in the crystalline state , but available in solution . Secondary binding to either the B or C-sites may require conformational changes that are less favorable in crystals or induce the higher-order assembly of complexes larger than dimers . The crystal structure of Mcg with sulfasalazine explains why only one disassociation constant for specific binding was measured . Crystals of the complex belong to space group P21212 with two symmetry-related ligands bound per Mcg dimer , and thus one ligand bound per VL in the asymmetric unit ( Figure 6B ) . Therefore , the equivalence of the two sulfasalazine ligands in the crystal explains why only one disassociation constant was measured by means of equilibrium dialysis . The crystal structure shows that each of the sulfasalazine ligands occupy all three A-B-C-sites simultaneously; each ligand binds to the A and B-sites on one of the VLs composing the dimer , while C-site binding is on the symmetry-related VL . This contrasts with methylene blue , which is bound only to the A-site . Despite differences in the exact orientation of the side chains where the ligands bind , both ligands bind in the cavity of the Mcg dimer ( Figure 6C ) . Although our experiments were performed using only VLs rather than full-length LCs , the ligand-binding site between VLs is maintained in full-length LCs . While full-length LCs are disulfide linked at their CL C-termini , crystal structures indicate that the conformation of VLs is independent of connected constant domains ( Ely et al . , 1989; Terzyan et al . , 2003; Makino et al . , 2007 ) . In full-length LCs , the joining ( J ) segment between VLs and CLs provides the flexibility for VLs to maintain the same hydrophobic cavity as that seen in the VL homo-dimer alone . This indicates the strategy of using ligands to stabilize the VL dimer and hinder amyloid fibril formation may also be effective for full-length homo-dimers . The ability of ligands to hinder the aggregation of VLs into amyloid fibrils by stabilizing VL dimers indicates a promising approach for treatment of systemic light chain amyloidosis disease . While the light chain amino acid sequence differs between patients , the characteristic hydrophobic cavity of the homo-dimer formed by overexpressed LCs is conserved ( Bodi et al . , 2009; Bork et al . , 1994; Edmundson et al . , 1976; Solomon and Weiss , 1995 ) . Although our experiments were performed using a single VL variant , LCs of both λ and κ maintain a similar tertiary structure and hydrophobic cavity ( Qin et al . , 2007; Wetzel , 1994; Brumshtein et al . , 2014; Bellotti et al . , 2000; Fink , 1998; Khurana et al . , 2001 ) . This conserved hydrophobic pocket indicates a possible target for designing medications that inhibit LC amyloidosis . Although methylene blue and sulfasalazine may not bind tightly enough to be directly repurposed as treatments for the disease , these ligands may serve as prototypes for development of effective medications . As indicated by the ability of these molecules to inhibit amyloid fibril formation , this approach may result in alleviated symptoms for systemic light chain amyloidosis patients . 4 Materials and methods Protein samples were prepared as previously described ( Brumshtein et al . , 2014 ) . In summary , the VL of the pathologic LC homo-dimer Mcg was expressed in E . Coli , purified in denaturing conditions , refolded , and concentrated . Following previous research demonstrating the ability of ligands to bind in the hydrophobic cavity between the two VL domains of the dimer , aromatic and other hydrophobic ligands were screened for an inhibitory effect on the formation of amyloid fibrils ( Edmundson et al . , 1984;1993 ) . Amyloid formation was monitored with Thioflavin T assays and electron microscopy analysis , and we used molecules that inhibited amyloid fibril formation at concentrations below 1 mM to search DrugBank to identify biomedical compounds with a similar structure that would potentially inhibit the formation of amyloid fibrils ( Law et al . , 2014 ) . We selected structures in DrugBank with a similarity threshold of 0 . 3 . Search filters were not applied to any other parameters . We dissolved the identified molecules in either water or 20% DMSO for subsequent use in assays of amyloid formation . Thioflavin ( ThT ) assays of Mcg amyloid formation were performed in acidic conditions as previously described ( Bellotti et al . , 2000 ) . Assays were conducted in the presence of varying concentrations of the ligands ( 1 . 0 , 0 . 50 , 0 . 25 , 0 . 12 , 0 . 05 , and 0 . 03 mM ) at 37°C and constant 300 rpm shaking with Teflon balls with 0 . 125 inch radii as stirrers . ThT fluorescence spectra were recorded at 440/480 nm excitation/emission wavelengths ( Wall et al . , 1999 ) . Samples from the ThT fibril formation assays were diluted with water to 10% v/v and applied onto copper grids with formvar-carbon coating ( Ted Pella , Inc . , Redding , CA , Cat . No . 01810 ) . Negative staining was performed with 2% w/v uranyl acetate and images were collected by means of a Tecnai T12 electron microscope at 120 kV with a Gatan CCD camera . Binding constants of the ligands with Mcg were derived using Rapid Equilibrium Dialysis plates with a membrane cutoff of 8 kDa ( Thermo Scientific Inc . , Cat . No . 90006 ) ( Waters et al . , 2008 ) . Methylene blue at concentrations ranging from ~1–200 μM with 0 . 5 and 1 . 0 mg/ml of Mcg , and sulfasalazine at concentrations ranging from ~100–5000 μM with 2 . 5 and 5 . 0 mg/ml of Mcg were incubated for 72 hours with constant agitation in standard laboratory conditions . Following incubation , samples were collected from the membrane and reference cells and final concentrations were measured by spectrophotometry . Co-crystallization trials were set up with a Mosquito micro-crystallization robot , using a solution of 20 mg/ml Mcg with 1 mM methylene blue or sulfasalazine ligands . All crystals appeared in the presence of sulfate or phosphate anions . Crystals were cryo-protected with 25% glycerol and X-ray data were collected at the 24-ID-C beamline of the Advanced Photon Source ( Mcg-methylene blue ) or with a Rigaku Raxis4++ with a HCT detector ( Mcg-sulfasalazine ) . X-ray diffraction data were processed with XDS package ( Kabsch , 2010 ) . Initial phases were obtained by means of molecular replacement using PDB 3MCG as the initial model and structures were refined with Refmac5 ( Murshudov et al . , 1997 ) . Graphics were rendered with PyMol and refined atomic models were deposited into the Protein Data Bank ( PDB ) ( DeLano , 2002 ) . Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed on Mcg in the presence of methylene blue and sulfasalazine . Equilibrium runs were performed at 20°C in a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge using absorption optics at 500 nm for methylene blue and 420 nm for sulfasalazine . Samples were at concentrations of 1 mg/ml of Mcg with 100 and 150 μM of methylene blue , and 1 and 2 . 5 mg/ml of Mcg with 300 and 500 μM sulfasalazine . The concentrations of the protein and ligands were chosen to obtain optical density readings in the linear range of the spectrophotometer yet with measurable quaternary state densities of the complexes . Sedimentation equilibrium profiles were measured at speeds of 10 , 000 , 14 , 000 and 22 , 000 rpm in a An-60 Ti rotor . To validate the deviation of the apparent molecular weight of Mcg with methylene blue , a set of experiments analyzing the meniscus depletion of the Mcg dimer were performed at 35 , 000 rpm . The data were fit with a non-linear least squares double exponential fit using the Beckman Origin-based software ( Version 3 . 01 ) ( Cohn and Edsall , 1943; Laue et al . , 1992 ) ."}

However , mutations alone cannot explain all the biological changes that occur to cancer cells . For example , very few mutations have been linked with a type of kidney cancer called clear cell renal cell carcinoma ( or ccRCC for short ) . Instead , scientists suspect that this cancer is largely caused by changes in the expression of particular genes so that certain cancer-promoting genes are more highly expressed , while other genes that would prevent tumor growth become less active . One of the few genes that is often mutated in ccRCC is called SETD2 . This gene is involved in processes that alter the structure of DNA , but do not alter the genes themselves . These “epigenetic” changes can alter how the instructions in genes are used to make proteins . The first step in making proteins is to use a section of DNA as a template to make molecules of messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) in a process called transcription . There are markers within a gene that show where transcription should start and stop to produce the mRNA required to make a particular protein . Epigenetic changes can mask these markers so that the cell produces longer mRNAs that incorporate instructions from neighboring genes . It was not known how often these stop signs are ignored in ccRCC cells . Here , Grosso et al . compared transcription in normal cells and in ccRCC tumor cells from 50 different patients . The experiments show that more stop signs were ignored in many of the cancer cells , especially in cells with mutations in SETD2 . This caused all or parts of neighboring genes to be transcribed along with the target gene and led to changes in the expression levels of these genes . For example , a cancer-promoting gene called BCL2 was more highly expressed in these cells . Furthermore , some of the mRNA molecules produced in these cancer cells may make “fusion” proteins that combine elements from several proteins . These fusion proteins may work differently to normal cell proteins and therefore might also promote the development of tumors . Grosso et al . ’s findings reveal a new link between epigenetic changes and cancer .", "article": "1 Introduction Clear cell renal cell carcinoma ( ccRCC ) is the most common histological subtype of renal carcinoma . The genetics of ccRCC is dominated by either somatic or germline inactivating mutations in the VHL gene . Regarding the full spectrum of genomic alterations , ccRCC ranks amongst solid tumors with the lowest average number of point mutations , small indels ( Kandoth et al . , 2013 ) and somatic copy number alterations ( Zack et al . , 2013 ) . These findings suggest that epigenetic events make a significant contribution for the deregulation of the oncogenic and tumor suppressor gene expression programs that drive ccRCC development and progression . In fact , mutations in ccRCC are frequently observed in epigenetic factors such as the chromatin-remodeler PBRM1 and the histone modifying enzymes BAP1 and SETD2 , highlighting the central role of epigenetic regulation in this particular cancer ( Duns et al . , 2010; Varela et al . , 2011; Dalgliesh et al . , 2010; Creighton et al . , 2013 ) . Such mutations in genes that control the epigenome can strongly modulate the landscape of the tumor transcriptome via aberrant expression of global sets of genes . For instance , defects in transcription termination lead to read-through beyond the annotated 3’ gene boundary and have the potential to severely modify the transcriptome and to risk the integrity of vital gene expression programs ( Kuehner et al . , 2011 ) . Paradoxically , the prevalence and functional outcome of transcription read-through has not been thoroughly scrutinized in any cancer before . Here , we report an unprecedented transcriptional profiling of a cohort of 50 pairs of ccRCC tumor and normal matched samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA ) . We show that transcription read-through is prevalent in ccRCC and found that high levels of transcription read-through correlate with poor survival rates . Amongst the most frequently mutated genes in ccRCC , we identify SETD2 inactivation as a major driving force of impaired transcription termination and high levels of read-through . Moreover , we show that transcription read-through overruns and interferes with the expression of downstream genes . We identify the anti-apoptotic oncogene BCL2 as one of such interfered genes , thereby illustrating a new mechanistic basis for the transcriptional deregulation of oncogenes . In addition , our transcriptome analyses revealed recurrent RNA chimeras generated from read-through episodes in ccRCC . RNA chimeras are common features of cancer cells formerly thought to be produced solely by chromosomal translocations . We now know that many chimeric transcripts can originate from DNA-independent events such as trans-splicing , RNA recombination or transcription read-through ( Gingeras , 2009 ) . Our analyses revealed that read-through is a major source of RNA chimeras in ccRCC and identified a novel chimera , the CTSC-RAB38 , in 20% of ccRCC tumors , but not in any normal matched sample . Altogether , our data disclose the prognostic power of transcription read-through and emphasizes its role as a major source of transcriptome diversity in ccRCC , namely via aberrant expression of cancer genes and RNA chimeras . 2 Results To investigate the prevalence of transcription read-through in ccRCC , we analysed RNA-seq data from 50 pairs of tumor and normal matched samples from TCGA ( Cancer Genome Atlas Research N , 2013 ) . Compared to normal tissue , all tumor samples exhibited several genes with transcription termination defects revealed by a high number of reads mapping downstream the transcription termination site ( TTS ) ( Figure 1A , B and Supplementary file 1A ) . Such accumulation of reads results from transcription read-through beyond the TTS , a surrogate for deficient transcription termination ( Higgs et al . , 1983 ) . In agreement with a defect in transcription termination , we did not detect differences in read counts on any region upstream the TTS , contrasting with the significant increase in the intergenic region immediately downstream this site ( Figure 1C ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 09214 . 003Figure 1 . Transcription read-through is prevalent in ccRCC . ( A ) Top graph depicts the number of genes with transcription read-through per ccRCC sample . The heatmap illustrates the genes with ( blue ) and without ( grey ) transcription read-through .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 09214 . 003 We then examined whether global deregulation of gene expression at the level of transcription termination affects overall survival rates of ccRCC patients . For that we segregated the TCGA samples into two categories: ‘high read-through’ samples ( those with more than 200 genes with read-through ) and ‘low read-through’ samples ( less than 200 genes with read-through ) ( Figure 2A ) . We found that patients with a ‘high read-through’ phenotype died significantly earlier than patients with a ‘low read-through’ phenotype ( p = 0 . 008 , log-rank test; Figure 2B ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 09214 . 004Figure 2 . Transcription read-through correlates with ccRCC survival rates . ( A ) The top graph indicates the number of genes with transcription read-through on each ccRCC patient sample . Samples were split in two groups according to the number of genes with transcription read-through ( low or high ) , using 200 genes as a cut-off . The heatmap represents the RNA-seq tumor/matched normal fold change 4 Kb after the TTS region of genes with transcription read-through . ( B ) Kaplan-Meier plot comparing the survival of patients separated into ‘high read-through’ and ‘low read-through’ subsets as defined in A . ( C ) Proportion of ccRCC patient samples with low and high transcription read-through . Results are shown for samples containing any of the most recurrently mutated genes in ccRCC: SETD2 , VHL , PBRM1 , BAP1 and MTOR . Proportions of high and low read-through were significantly different between samples carrying mutation in SETD2 and in any of the remaining genes ( Fisher’s Exact Test p<0 . 05 ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 09214 . 004 To estimate the contribution of the five most frequently mutated genes in ccRCC ( Cancer Genome Atlas Research N , 2013 ) to the observed transcription termination defects , we calculated the percentage of samples carrying any of these mutations that fall within each of the two subsets defined above . Samples with mutations in the histone methyltransferase SETD2 scored preferentially in the ‘high read-through’ category ( 58% ) ( Figure 2C ) . In contrast , samples carrying any of the four other frequently mutated genes in ccRCC segregated equally between both groups ( BAP1 ) or mainly in the ‘low read-through’ category ( VHL , PBRM1 , MTOR . Figure 2C ) . Mutations on other genes known to be required for transcription termination or pre-mRNA processing were rare and did not segregate specifically in any category ( Supplementary file 1B ) . These data suggest that widespread transcription read-through is a distinctive hallmark of ccRCC and identify SETD2 mutations as a putative contributing factor for this phenotype . To further investigate the correlation between SETD2 mutations and transcription read-through in ccRCC , we performed RNA sequencing of 2 SETD2 wild type ( wt ) and 4 SETD2 mutant ccRCC cell lines previously reported to have a marked reduction of H3K36me3 levels ( Duns et al . , 2010; Carvalho et al . , 2014 ) . The wt ccRCC cell line Caki2 showed the highest SETD2 expression levels , comparable with those of a non-cancer kidney epithelial cell line ( HEK293 ) ( Figure 3A ) . For this reason , we chose Caki2 as the reference dataset for the pairwise analyses of the remaining wt ( Caki1 ) and mutant ( MF , AB , ER , FG2 ) samples . These analyses revealed transcription read-through in hundreds of genes on all ccRCC cell lines , with a significantly higher incidence in all SETD2 mutant cells ( Figure 3B and Supplementary file 1C ) . A metagene analysis of genes with transcription termination defects in SETD2 mutant cells revealed that expression levels vary significantly downstream the TTS , but not within the gene body or at the promoter region ( Figure 3C ) . Moreover , heatmaps of the fold change of read counts between different cell lines depict a strong increase in the number of read-through reads in SETD2 mutant cells ( Figure 3D and Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) . To rule out the contribution of different genetic backgrounds in these cell lines , we interrogated RNA-seq data from: SETD2 knockout ( KO ) ccRCC cells ( Ho et al . , 2015 ) ; SETD2-depleted human mesenchymal stem ( MS ) cells ( Luco et al . , 2010 ) ; and embryonic stem ( ES ) cells from Setd2 KO mice ( Zhang et al . , 2014 ) . Again , when compared to wt cells , SETD2-deficient cells displayed increased read counts specifically in the region immediately downstream the TTS consistent with transcription read-through events ( Figure 3E , F; Figure 3—figure supplement 2 and Supplementary file 1D , E , F ) . Similar results were obtained upon RT-qPCR measurements of transcription read-through in three distinct genes 48 hr after depletion of SETD2 from wt ccRCC cells by RNA interference ( Figure 3—figure supplement 3 ) 10 . 7554/eLife . 09214 . 005Figure 3 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 09214 . 008 We then investigated whether wt SETD2 can rescue the transcription termination defects observed in SETD2 mutant ccRCC cells . For that , we performed single-molecule RNA FISH after transient expression of GFP-tagged SETD2 in a SETD2 mutant ccRCC cell line ( Figure 4A ) . RNAs produced upon transcription read-through of MRPL23 and SEL1L3 were visualized as foci obtained with RNA FISH probes targeting a region downstream the termination site . These foci were present in significantly higher number in GFP-negative cells than in wt SETD2-GFP expressing cells ( Figure 4B ) . This result reveals that expression of wt SETD2 is sufficient to revert the transcription termination defects observed in mutant cells . Altogether , these data support the view that SETD2 is necessary to guide correct transcription termination genome-wide and that mutations in this histone modifier gene cause aberrant transcription patterns in ccRCC . 10 . 7554/eLife . 09214 . 009Figure 4 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 09214 . 009 One possible functional consequence of aberrant transcription read-through is the invasion of adjacent downstream genes altering their expression levels . This trans-acting transcriptional interference mechanism may play important roles in cancer development and progression by deregulating the expression of relevant oncogenes and tumor suppressors ( Proudfoot , 1986 ) . To test whether overrunning of neighbouring genes is a frequent outcome of transcription read-through in ccRCC , we analysed the expression levels of the entire intergenic region and of the gene located immediately downstream . In agreement with our prediction , there was a statistically significant increase in read counts along the intergenic region and within the body of the downstream gene of a tandem pair ( Figure 5A ) . This difference was still detected after the TTS of the downstream gene , but not within the upstream gene ( Figure 5B ) . Overall , reading-through RNA polymerase II ( RNAPII ) molecules invaded an average of 20% of genes located downstream ( Supplementary file 1A ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 09214 . 010Figure 5 . Transcription read-through overruns and interferes with the expression of neighbouring genes . Heatmap ( A ) and metagene ( B ) profiles of the intergenic region and of the gene located downstream of a read-through event in one representative ccRCC TCGA sample ( patient barcode TCGA-CZ-5465 ) .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 09214 . 010 We then asked if read-through levels correlate with the expression levels of the downstream gene across the TCGA dataset . Notably , expression of 52 out of 903 genes ( 6% ) exhibited a statistically significant correlation with read-through levels of the upstream gene ( Figure 6A , Supplementary file 1G ) . From these , 51 genes were positively correlated and only one gene showed a negative correlation . Amongst positively correlated genes we found the anti-apoptotic oncogene BCL2 . In support of its oncogenic role in kidney cancer , depletion of BCL2 with antisense oligonucleotides inhibits ccRCC tumor growth in vitro and in vivo ( Uchida et al . , 2001 ) . We further observed that expression of BCL2 is frequently increased in the tumor samples of the TCGA dataset when compared to the matched samples ( Figure 6B ) . Importantly , augmented levels of BCL2 mRNA and protein correlated positively with the levels of transcription read-through of the KDSR gene located immediately upstream ( Figure 6B , C ) . Altogether , these data suggest that transcription termination defects interfere with the expression of neighbouring genes and illustrate a new paradigm for the aberrant expression of cancer-related genes , which may explain the upregulation of the BCL2 oncogene in ccRCC . 10 . 7554/eLife . 09214 . 011Figure 6 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 09214 . 011 RNAPII elongation beyond the annotated gene boundaries and invasion of an adjacent gene as a result of impaired transcription termination may result in the formation of hybrid transcripts collectively called RNA chimeras ( Gingeras , 2009 ) . In addition to gene fusions ( formed upon chromosomal translocations ) RNA chimeras can originate from DNA-independent events such as trans-splicing , RNA recombination or transcriptional read-through ( Gingeras , 2009 ) . Our analysis of ccRCC RNA-seq data revealed a high number of reads mapping at two distinct tandem genes , which are indicative of RNA chimeras generated by intergenic splicing following a read-through event ( Figure 7A , Supplementary file 1H ) . Analysis of the splicing pattern of these chimeras showed that most events join the second-last exon of the upstream gene with the second exon of the downstream gene ( Figure 7B ) . This pattern is compatible with the exon definition model according to which transcription termination is necessary for the selection of the terminal 3’ splice site ( ss ) ( Niwa et al . , 1992; Dye and Proudfoot , 1999 ) . In the absence of transcription termination , the terminal 3’ss is evicted and the terminal 5’ss will splice together with the first 3’ss of the downstream gene , which emerges from the nascent transcript once RNAPII reaches the second exon ( Figure 7B ) . Interestingly , the number of RNA chimeras detected correlated positively with the levels of transcription read-through ( p = 0 . 003; R = 0 . 41 ) and was significantly higher in the sample group with a ‘high read-through’ phenotype defined above ( Figure 7C ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 09214 . 012Figure 7 . Read-through RNA chimeras are prevalent in ccRCC . ( A ) Circos plots showing the location of genes forming each RNA chimera detected on human ccRCC cell lines and TCGA samples .

( C ) Number of read-through RNA chimeras in the low and high read-through sample subsets defined in Figure 2A . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 09214 . 012 A remarkable feature of these RNA chimeras is that some were recurrently detected in different tumor samples . One particular chimera , encoded by two consecutive genes - CTSC and RAB38 - was detected in 20% of the TCGA samples ( but not in any matched normal sample ) and in four of the six ccRCC cell lines that we sequenced de novo ( Supplementary file 1H ) . We validated this RNA chimera by RT-qPCR before and after transfection of the ccRCC cell lines with a small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) spanning the transcript break-point , which resulted in a robust depletion of CTSC-RAB38 ( Figure 8A , B ) . In contrast , siRNAs targeting either the last exon of CTSC or the first exon of RAB38 ( which are not included in the chimeric transcript ) significantly decreased the levels of CTSC and RAB38 , respectively , but not the levels of the CTSC-RAB38 chimera ( Figure 8B , C ) . Moreover , we measured the RNAPII occupancy throughout the intergenic region and within the body of the CTSC and RAB38 genes by chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) . We detected a robust occupancy of RNAPII throughout the intergenic region ( Figure 8D ) , which further suggests that the CTSC-RAB38 chimera is generated following a read-through episode without any genomic deletion or translocation involved . 10 . 7554/eLife . 09214 . 013Figure 8 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 09214 . 013 3 Discussion Our transcriptome analysis of a large dataset of tumor and normal matched samples revealed that transcription events extending beyond the annotated 3’ end of genes are frequent in ccRCC . Strikingly , our analysis further disclosed an unexpected prognostic power of transcription read-through in kidney cancer: higher number of genes with transcription read-through correlates significantly with poorer patient survival . Amongst the most frequently mutated genes in ccRCC , we identified SETD2 inactivation as a contributing factor for increased transcription read-through . In fact , ectopic expression of SETD2 was sufficient to rescue the transcription termination defects of SETD2 mutant ccRCC cells . Moreover , we report that the effects of impaired transcription termination are not confined to the affected gene . Instead , it also contaminates the expression of neighboring genes that are overran by reading-through RNAPII complexes . Importantly , amongst the genes whose expression directly correlates with the volume of transcription read-through on the upstream gene , we detected the anti-apoptotic oncogene BCL2 . This finding unveils a new source of aberrant expression of cancer-related genes and provides a plausible mechanistic basis for the upregulation of BCL2 frequently observed in ccRCC . Our present study further reveals recurrent RNA chimeras in ccRCC combining sequences from two tandem genes . Such chimeras are generated following extensions of RNAPII beyond the annotated gene boundaries and invasion of an adjacent gene as a result of impaired transcription termination . According to the exon definition model ( Niwa et al . , 1992; Dye and Proudfoot , 1999 ) , deficient transcription termination is expected to impair the splicing of the last exon . In agreement , most chimeras skip the last exon of the upstream gene and the prevailing splicing pattern joins the second-last exon of the upstream gene with the second exon of the downstream gene . The finding that several of these RNA chimeras are recurrently detected in two or more tumor samples , suggests that they were selected during cancer development and supports the exciting possibility that they may play relevant functional roles . Although our study primarily focused on the characterization of the transcription termination defects and their impact on the ccRCC transcriptome , our pioneer findings raise intriguing questions such as: which mechanism ( s ) drive such transcription defects ? ; how individual RNA chimeras are functionally involved in tumorigenesis ? ; do chimeric transcripts produce functional oncoproteins and/or can they directly affect the expression of other relevant cancer genes ? ; how can we intervene therapeutically to restore the canonical transcription pattern ? The widespread incidence of aberrant termination in ccRCC cells suggests that it may play important roles in expanding the transcriptome diversity that drives cancer development and progression . The impact on BCL2 expression illustrates a relevant functional outcome of transcription read-though . The generation of chimeric transcripts , namely those recurrently identified in several samples , such as CTSC-RAB38 , further discloses the contribution of impaired transcription termination for the expansion of RNA species that may favor cancer progression . Nevertheless , future studies should provide direct evidence that a chimeric transcript has oncogenic functions in order to support the physiological relevance of these RNAs . This is a challenging and very exciting topic and further efforts are required to fully elucidate the impact of impaired transcription termination on cancer in general and on ccRCC in particular . 4 Materials and methods ccRCC cells ( Caki-1 , Caki-2 , MF , ER , AB and FG2 , Cell Line Services Eppelheim , Germany ) were grown as monolayers in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium ( DMEM , Invitrogen , CA , USA ) , supplemented with 10% ( v/v ) FBS , 1% ( v/v ) nonessential amino acids , 1% ( v/v ) L-glutamine and 100U/ml penicillin-streptomycin , and maintained at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 . RNAi was achieved using synthetic siRNA duplexes ( Eurogentec , Belgium ) . The sequence of the siRNAs is shown in Supplementary file 1I . siRNAs targeting the firefly luciferase ( GL2 ) were used as controls . Cells were reverse transfected with 10 μM siRNAs using OptiMEM ( Invitrogen ) and Lipofectamine RNAiMAX ( Invitrogen ) , according to the manufacturer’s instructions . 24 hr after the first transfection , cells were re-transfected with the same siRNA duplexes and transfection reagents and harvested on the following day . Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol ( Invitrogen ) . cDNA was made using Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase ( Invitrogen ) . RT-qPCR was performed in the ViiA Real Time PCR ( Applied Biosystems , CA , USA ) , using SYBR Green PCR master mix ( Applied Biosystems ) . The relative RNA expression was estimated as follows: 2^ ( Ct reference – Ct sample ) , where Ct reference and Ct sample are mean threshold cycles of RT-qPCR done in duplicate on cDNA samples from U6 snRNA ( reference ) and the cDNA from the genes of interest ( sample ) . All primer sequences are presented in Supplementary file 1I . ChIP was performed as described ( de Almeida et al . , 2011 ) . The relative occupancy of RNAPII at each locus was estimated by RT-qPCR as follows: 2^ ( Ct Input – Ct IP ) , where Ct Input and Ct IP are mean threshold cycles of RT-qPCR done in duplicate on DNA samples from input and specific immunoprecipitations , respectively . RNAPII was precipitated with an antibody against its largest subunit ( N20 , sc-899; Santa Cruz , TX , USA ) . The sequences of gene-specific , intergenic regions and gene desert primer pairs are presented in Supplementary file 1I . FG2 ccRCC cells were transiently transfected with a wt SETD2-GFP expression plasmid ( Carvalho et al . , 2014 ) and cultured on glass coverslip for 24 hr before hybridization with RNA FISH probes ( Biosearch Technologies , CA , USA ) following the manufacturer’s protocol . Briefly , cells were washed with PBS , fixed for 10 min at room temperature , washed twice with PBS , and permeabilized at 4°C in 70% ( vol/vol ) EtOH . Probes diluted in hybridization buffer were added to permeabilized cells before overnight incubation in a dark chamber at 37°C . After washing , DAPI was added to stain the nuclei . Epi-fluorescence microscopy was performed using a Zeiss Z1 microscope equipped with Z-piezo ( Prior , MA , USA ) , a 63x 1 . 4 NA Plan-Apochromat objective and a sCMOS camera ( Hamamatsu Flash 4 . 0 ) . FISH probes were designed to target a segment of the RNA transcript encoded by the intergenic region downstream of the canonical termination sites of MRPL23 and SEL1L3 . The sequences of the probes are shown in Supplementary file 1J . Samples were barcoded and prepared for sequencing by the Centro Nacional de Análisis Genómico ( CNAG , Barcelona , Spain ) using Illumina protocols . PolyA+ RNA-seq libraries of ccRCC cell lines were sequenced as paired-end 75-bp sequence tags using the standard Illumina pipeline . ccRCC RNA-seq datasets ( with at least 40 million mapped reads on each tumor and matched normal samples – in a total of 50 paired-samples listed in Supplementary file 1A ) were obtained from TCGA . HEK293 RNA-seq data were from the Sequence Read Archive ( SRX876600 ) . RNA-seq data from SETD2 KO ccRCC cells ( 786-O ) , SETD2-depleted human MS cells and Setd2 KO mouse ES cells were obtained from the GEO ( http://www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov/geo/ GSE66879 , GSE19373 and GSE54932 , respectively ) . Data quality was assessed with the FastQC ( http://www . bioinformatics . babraham . ac . uk/projects/fastqc/ ) quality-control tool for high throughput sequence data . Sequence tags were then mapped to the reference human ( hg19 ) or mouse ( mm9 ) genomes with TopHat software using default parameters ( Kim et al . , 2013 ) . Reads from samples with multiple sequencing lanes were merged and only the best score alignment was accepted for each read . Gene annotations were obtained from UCSC knownGene and refGene tables ( Karolchik et al . , 2014 ) and merged into a single transcript model per gene using BedTools ( Quinlan and Hall , 2010 ) . Our analysis was restricted to transcriptionally active genes defined as those with expression levels higher than the 25th percentile . To identify genes with transcriptional read-through , we filtered out all genes for which there was another annotated gene in either strand within a region of 5 Kb downstream of their TTS . We also filtered out genes with an overall increase in expression level relative to the control sample . Reads were counted in 100 bp windows for the 4 Kb region downstream of the TTS and normalized for the total number of mapped reads on each sample ( RPKMs ) ( Mortazavi et al . , 2008 ) . We considered the occurrence of transcriptional read-through when more than six 100 bp windows showed increased ( at least 1 . 5 fold-change ) RPKMs relative to control . The control samples were: Caki2 for ccRCC cell lines; the matched normal tissue sample for each ccRCC patient; control 786-O ccRCC cells for SETD2 KO 786-O cells; human MS cells for SETD2-depleted human MS cells; and wt mouse ES cells for the Setd2 KO mouse . In the ccRCC cell lines dataset , all the analysis were also performed comparing both SETD2 wt ( Caki1 vs Caki2 ) , with this comparison working as a negative control . Statistical significance of the differences between proportions of genes showing read-through was assessed using the Fisher’s exact test . RNA chimeras were detected using the fusion-search option ( fusion-min-dist set to 100 bp ) in TopHat alignment ( Kim et al . , 2013 ) and TopHat-Fusion ( Kim and Salzberg , 2011 ) with default parameters . For downstream analysis we only considered RNA chimeras supported by at least two reads . A set of in-house scripts were written in bash and in the R environmental language ( http://www . R-project . org/ ) ( Team RDC , 2011 ) . Figures were produced using BedTools ( Quinlan and Hall , 2010 ) and default packages from the R environment . To produce heatmaps and metagene average profiles showing transcription read-through , genes were scaled to 60 equally sized bins so that all annotated TSSs and TTSs were aligned . Regions 4 Kb upstream of TSSs and 4 Kb downstream of TTSs were averaged in a 100-bp window . Individual gene profiles were produced by successions of 10-bp windows ( single gene ) or 100-bp windows ( two genes ) . All read counts were normalized by genomic region length and number of mapped reads ( RPKM ) , and RPKM values were log2 transformed when representing multiple genes . Protein levels assessed by reverse phase protein array ( RPPA ) were gathered from the TCGA portal . Circle plots showing RNA chimeras distribution were produced using Circos ( Krzywinski et al . , 2009 ) . The RNA-seq data for ccRCC cell lines have been deposited in Gene Expression Omnibus ( GEO; http://www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov/geo/ ) database under the accession number GSE64451 . ccRCC RNA-seq datasets were obtained from TCGA . HEK293 RNA-seq data were from the Sequence Read Archive ( SRX876600 ) . RNA-seq data from SETD2 KO 786-O ccRCC cells , human mesenchymal stem cells and mouse embryonic stem cells were obtained from the GEO ( GSE66879 , GSE19373 and GSE54932 , respectively ) ."}
{"doi": "elife-53895-v3", "abstract": "During kidney development , WNT/β-catenin signalling has to be tightly controlled to ensure proliferation and differentiation of nephron progenitor cells . Here , we show in mice that the signalling molecules RSPO1 and RSPO3 act in a functionally redundant manner to permit WNT/β-catenin signalling and their genetic deletion leads to a rapid decline of nephron progenitors . By contrast , tissue specific deletion in cap mesenchymal cells abolishes mesenchyme to epithelial transition ( MET ) that is linked to a loss of Bmp7 expression , absence of SMAD1/5 phosphorylation and a concomitant failure to activate Lef1 , Fgf8 and Wnt4 , thus explaining the observed phenotype on a molecular level . Surprisingly , the full knockout of LGR4/5/6 , the cognate receptors of R-spondins , only mildly affects progenitor numbers , but does not interfere with MET . Taken together our data demonstrate key roles for R-spondins in permitting stem cell maintenance and differentiation and reveal Lgr-dependent and independent functions for these ligands during kidney formation .", "plain language summary": "Kidneys filter waste out of the bloodstream to produce urine . Each kidney contains many structures called nephrons which separate the waste from the blood . The number of nephrons in a kidney varies between people , and those with low numbers have a higher risk of chronic kidney disease . Nephrons are formed before birth from a specific group of so-called progenitor cells . Each of these cells can either divide to make others like itself , or it can specialize to make nephron cells . At the end of embryonic kidney development , all the progenitor cells become nephron cells . Cells that specialize to become part of a nephron first go through a change called a mesenchyme-to-epithelial transition . Epithelial cells move less than mesenchymal cells , and also develop a clear structure where the two ends of the cell adapt to different roles . Evidence suggests that a cell communication process called WNT/β-catenin signaling controls this transition . Yet the details of how this transition is controlled are not fully understood . One way to activate WNT/β-catenin signaling is with R-spondin proteins , which have been found in developing kidneys . Vidal et al . studied R-spondins during the embryonic development of kidneys in mice . Removing R-spondins stopped the progenitor cells from producing more of themselves and increased the number that died . The R-spondins were also needed for the progenitor cells to specialize as nephron cells through the mesenchyme-to-epithelial transition . Further results revealed that R-spondins activate WNT/β-catenin signaling in these cells , even though the proteins that usually act as R-spondin receptors ( called LGR4/5/6 ) could be removed without affecting the results . This suggests that R-spondins interact with different receptor proteins during kidney development . These findings highlight the role of R-spondins and WNT/β-catenin signaling in kidney development . Future studies will seek the receptor proteins that R-spondins interact with in kidneys . They may also look to understand how R-spondins balance their different roles in progenitor cells and during cell specialization . These results in mice could also be extended to determine their relevance in human health and disease , including chronic kidney disease , which is responsible for more deaths than breast or prostate cancer .", "article": "1 Introduction Nephron endowment is a critical factor for renal health and low number of nephrons have been associated with chronic kidney disease and hypertension ( Bertram et al . , 2011 ) . In mammals , nephrogenesis is restricted to the developmental period and involves a dedicated nephrogenic niche at the most cortical region of the forming kidney that fuels successive rounds of nephron production ( McMahon , 2016; Oxburgh , 2018; O'Brien , 2019 ) . The nephrogenic niche consists of three independent progenitor populations that will develop into collecting ducts , stroma ( interstitial cells ) and nephrons . Nephron progenitor cells ( NPCs ) form a condensed cap around the tips of the branching ureter . This cap mesenchyme ( CM ) can be further subdivided into populations that represent cells of progressive differentiation status depending on the position along their migration trajectories around the ureteric tips . Analysis over the last decade have identified at least four different subpopulations: 1 ) CITED1+/SIX2+ that are considered as ‘ground-state’ progenitors; 2 ) CITED1-/SIX2+ progenitors; 3 ) primed CITED1-/SIX2+/pSMAD+ progenitors; 4 ) WNT4+/LEF1+ pretubular aggregates ( PTA ) . Once engaged , PTAs undergo a mesenchyme to epithelial transition ( MET ) to form epithelialized renal vesicles , which will further differentiate via comma- and S-shaped bodies into segmented nephrons . This traditional view of a molecular and spatial subdivision of the CM has been challenged by findings that nephron progenitor cells ( NPCs ) are much more mobile than previously appreciated . Indeed , NPCs have been observed to travel back and forth between caps of independent tips ( Combes et al . , 2016 ) and between the pretubular aggregate and cap mesenchyme state ( Lawlor et al . , 2019 ) . The transformation of nephron progenitors into epithelialized nephrons is not an entirely cell-intrinsic process , but requires inductive signals from both the ureteric tip and stromal cells ( O'Brien , 2019 ) . Of particular importance is WNT9b , a molecule released from the branching ureter that induces canonical WNT/β-catenin signalling , stimulates proliferation and thus ensures self-renewal of kidney progenitors . Accordingly , deletion of β–catenin leads to the loss of progenitor cells ( Karner et al . , 2011 ) . However , canonical WNT signalling is also required for MET ( Carroll et al . , 2005 ) and transient activation of β–catenin in isolated progenitors induces epithelialisation ( Park et al . , 2007; Kuure et al . , 2007; Park et al . , 2012 ) . How the balance between progenitor proliferation and differentiation is achieved is not well understood , but experimental evidence suggests that progenitor proliferation requires low levels of β-catenin activity , whereas genes that are involved in MET are activated in the presence of a strong canonical β-catenin signal ( Ramalingam et al . , 2018 ) . In the context of nephrogenesis , a strong β-catenin response appears to rely on the activation of canonical BMP/SMAD pathway , as progenitor cells leaving the niche are positive for pSMAD and deletion of Bmp7 interferes with MET ( Brown et al . , 2013 ) . WNT/β-catenin signalling is essential for many organ systems and multiple feedback mechanisms have been identified that control signalling strength at almost every level of this signal transduction pathway . WNT receptor availability at the cell membrane is controlled by RNF43 and ZNRF3 , two trans-membrane E3 ubiquitin ligases that induce receptor endocytosis and thus negatively regulate WNT signalling . Their action is counteracted by R-spondins ( RSPO1-4 ) , a family of secreted molecules that bind to the G-protein-coupled receptors LGR4/5/6 . Binding to LGRs permits R-spondins to interact with RNF43/ZNRF3 and suppress endocytosis of the WNT receptor complex , thus enhancing WNT signalling ( de Lau et al . , 2014 ) . In this study , we investigated a potential role of the R-spondin/LGR axis in controlling renal stem/progenitor behaviour in vivo . We show that Rspo1 and Rspo3 are required to maintain the pool of renal progenitors throughout development by supporting their proliferative capacity and preventing their apoptosis . Moreover , strong R-spondin signal is essential to allow nephron progenitors to engage in differentiation and undergo MET . RSPO1/3 achieve these functions by their ability to activate the WNT/β−catenin signalling pathway , a role that is primarily mediated in an LGR-independent manner . 2 Results To understand the role of R-spondins during kidney development in mice , we first mapped the expression of the four members of this gene family using qPCR and in situ hybridisation analysis . Although Rspo2 and Rspo4 were undetectable in developing kidneys ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1A—source data 1 ) , Rspo1 and Rspo3 could be found as early as E10 . 5 within SIX2+ renal progenitors ( Figure 1—figure supplements 1B and Motamedi et al . , 2014 ) . Interestingly , Rspo3 marked only a proportion of SIX2 positive cells , suggesting this population to be heterogeneous already at this early age ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1B ) . At E14 . 5 , Rspo1 was detected throughout the CM , PTA , within renal vesicles , and the proximal part of the comma- and S-shaped bodies , but decreased upon podocyte differentiation ( Figure 1A and Figure 1—figure supplement 1C ) . By contrast , Rspo3 expression was restricted to uncommitted SIX2+ cells ( Figure 1B and Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–C ) , and what appeared to be low levels of expression within the cortical stroma ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1C ) . Indeed , expression within the most cortical population of stromal cells persisted in animals that carry a CM-specific deletion of Rspo3 ( Six2:Cre , Rspo3fl/fl ) ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1C ) . Interestingly , by E18 . 5 Rspo3 was dramatically reduced in NPCs , but strongly expressed in the cortical stromal compartment ( Figure 1Bii ) , indicating a shift of expression towards the stroma . Strong Rspo3 signal was also detected in stromal cells lining ducts of the renal papilla ( Figure 1Biii ) . Lack of Rspo1 is compatible with life ( Chassot et al . , 2008 ) and kidneys isolated from knockout mice showed no discernible abnormalities ( data not shown ) . Mice carrying a constitutive deletion of Rspo3 die at E9 . 5 due to placental defects ( Aoki et al . , 2007; Kazanskaya et al . , 2008 ) . To overcome this early lethality , we employed a conditional allele for Rspo3 ( Rspo3fl/fl ) ( Rocha et al . , 2015 ) in combination with a range of Cre-expressing lines ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ) . Tamoxifen ( Tam ) induction at E11 . 5 in presence of the ubiquitously expressed CAGG:CreERTM driver ( Hayashi and McMahon , 2002 ) efficiently abolished Rspo3 expression 3 days after induction ( E14 . 5 ) ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1A ) and resulted in a mild reduction of progenitor cells ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3B ) . To test whether Rspo1 and Rspo3 may act in a functionally redundant manner , we induced deletion at E11 . 5 and analysed the renal phenotype at E14 . 5 and E18 . 5 in double mutant animals ( CAGG:CreERTM; Rspo1-/- , Rspo3fl/fl - from now on called DM ) . Depletion was efficient , and no compensatory up-regulation of Rspo2 or Rspo4 was detected in double mutant kidneys ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1A ) . Macroscopic observation at E18 . 5 showed severe renal hypoplasia in R-spondin DM , when compared to control littermates ( Figure 1C , D ) . Hematoxylin and Eosin ( H&E ) staining of kidneys at E14 . 5 indicated a reduced nephrogenic zone and a near-complete absence of nephrons ( Figure 1E ) . Molecular analysis confirmed a dramatic loss of SIX2+ progenitors and an absence of forming nephrons ( Figure 2A ) . The remaining SIX2-positive cells appeared scattered , when compared to the condensed mesenchyme seen in controls . A similar loss of NPCs was observed when R-spondin deletion was induced at E10 . 5 , E12 . 5 or E13 . 5 indicating a continuous requirement of these signalling molecules for the maintenance of the NPC pool ( data not shown ) . To test whether the reduction of progenitors was caused by defects in proliferation or apoptosis , we next quantified BrdU incorporation and TUNEL staining ( Figure 2B–C; Figure 2—source data 1; Figure 2—figure supplement 1B , C ) . In order to measure early events of R-spondin deletion within progenitors , we allowed the first wave of nephrons to form , TAM-induced CRE activity at E12 . 5 and analysed samples 2 days thereafter . Quantification of BrdU-labelled SIX2+ progenitors indicated a 40% reduction of proliferation in this compartment ( p=0 . 0003 ) ( Figure 2B ) . In addition , a significant 8 . 1 fold increase of apoptosis among the SIX2+ cells located in the CM was observed ( p=0 . 0319 ) ( Figure 2C ) . As R-spondins are known activators of Wnt/β-catenin signalling , we analysed the expression of Axin2 , a direct downstream target and read-out of canonical β–catenin signalling . Ubiquitous deletion of R-spondins caused a general downregulation of Axin2 already 2 days after tamoxifen induction , an observation consistent with a loss of WNT/β–catenin signalling ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1D ) . Progenitor-specific deletion of β-catenin ( Six2:Cre; Ctnnb1fl/fl ) phenocopied the Rspo1/3 DM phenotype with a dramatic reduction ( 93%; p<0 . 0001 ) of SIX2+ progenitor cells and a near-complete block of nephron formation as indicated by an almost complete absence of the nephron specific marker JAG1 ( Figure 2D and E; Figure 2—source data 1 ) . Taken together these data indicate a requirement of R-spondins for nephron progenitor maintenance via the activation of canonical β-catenin signalling . Rspo3 is produced by both , stromal and nephron progenitors , but at later stages expression shifts to a predominantly stromal expression ( compare Figure 1Bi with Figure 1Bii ) . To evaluate the contribution of stromally derived RSPO3 , on kidney development , we specifically depleted its expression in this compartment using the constitutively active Foxd1:Cre line . In this context , progenitor cells were the only source of RSPO3 ( Figure 3A and Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ) . At E14 . 5 , Foxd1:Cre-DM kidneys appeared normal and showed a comparable number of SIX2+ cells per section when compared to control littermates ( p=0 . 7887; Figure 3C; Figure 3—source data 1 and data not shown ) . By contrast , at E18 . 5 mutant kidneys were hypoplastic ( Figure 3B ) and displayed a reduction of the nephrogenic zone associated with a significant loss of SIX2+ progenitor cells ( p=0 . 0167 ) ( Figure 3D–F; Figure 3—source data 1 ) . We conclude that continuous expression of Rspo3 from the stromal compartment is required to maintain progenitor cells at later stages of kidney formation . To test the role of progenitor-released R-spondins , we used a constitutively active progenitor specific Cre-line ( Six2:Cre ) to delete expression of Rspo3 in this cell compartment . Consequently , in Rspo1-/-; Six2:Cre; Rspo3fl/fl mice ( Six2:Cre-DM ) , stromal Rspo3 is the only remaining R-spondin ( Figure 4A and Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ) . At E18 . 5 Six2:Cre-DM embryos had hypodysplastic kidneys that histologically displayed defects in nephrogenesis and a complete absence of glomeruli ( Figure 4B ) . Histological and immunofluorescent analysis of E14 . 5 kidneys confirmed this observation and revealed the persistence of SIX2+ progenitors albeit at slightly lower numbers ( Figure 4C and Figure 4—figure supplement 1B ) . Importantly , staining for JAG1 and WT1 demonstrated a complete absence of epithelial nephrons and podocytes , respectively , indicating an essential role for R-spondin1/3 in nephron differentiation . The above phenotype is reminiscent of defects seen in mutants for Wnt9b , a signalling molecule that is released from the branching ureter . WNT9b activity has been shown to activate two classes of β–catenin dependent genes: Class II genes that require lower levels of β–catenin signalling and are found predominantly in nephron progenitors; Class I genes such as Wnt4 that depend on strong β–catenin activation and are highly expressed in pretubular aggregates ( Karner et al . , 2011; Ramalingam et al . , 2018 ) . In situ hybridisation ( ISH ) analysis revealed that loss of R-spondins did not impact Wnt9b expression ( Figure 4Di and ii ) , but dramatically reduced the expression of Class II ( Bmp7 , Tfrc , Crym1 , Uncx4 , Etv5 and Slc12a ) target genes within progenitors ( Figure 4D and Figure 4—figure supplement 1C ) . Interestingly , Tfrc was absent from mesenchymal cells , but was maintained to be expressed in the ureteric epithelium suggesting that progenitor-specific R-spondin expression is dispensable for its activation in the collecting duct system . The class I target Wnt4 , a key regulator of MET ( Stark et al . , 1994 ) , was also undetectable within the nephrogenic zone , but remained expressed in medullary stromal cells ( Figure 4D ix and x ) . Consistent with a requirement of R-spondins for β-catenin activation , the direct downstream target Axin2 was 51% down regulated in the nephrogenic zone of mutant kidneys ( p<0 . 0001 , Figure 4E; Figure 4—source data 1 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1D ) . Six2:Cre-DM kidneys showed a small reduction of nephron progenitors ( Figure 4C ) . To exclude the possibility that the lower number of progenitors interfered with the MET process , we employed the Wt1:CreERT2 strain ( Figure 5A ) , which in response to Tamoxifen activation , induced deletion primarily within nephron progenitors ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) . Wt1:CreERT2-DM embryos kidneys contained large numbers of SIX2+ progenitors ( Figure 5Bi and ii ) that failed to differentiate . Indeed , expression of LEF1 , a direct target and interaction partner of β-catenin that is also a marker of committed pretubular aggregates , was virtually absent from the nephrogenic region of Rspo1/3 double mutant mice ( Figure 5Biii and iv ) . Six2:Cre and Wt1:CreERT2 driven deletion thus showed a very similar phenotype . The higher number of progenitors in WT1:CreERT2-induced mutants is likely due to less efficient deletion of Rspo3 and , as a consequence , persistence of slightly higher levels of R-spondin activity . Isolated NPCs can be induced to undergo MET when cultured under high-density conditions and stimulated with chiron ( CHIR99021 ) , an inducer of canonical β-catenin signalling . To test whether R-spondins can replace chemical inducers under such in vitro conditions , we treated freshly isolated NPCs with recombinant WNT3A , RSPO3 or a combination of both ( Figure 5C; Figure 5—source data 1 ) . Gene expression analysis after 48 hr revealed a 2 . 3-fold and 4 . 6-fold increase for the β-catenin targets Axin2 and Wnt4 , respectively , after combined treatment ( Figure 5D ) . Interestingly , treatment with recombinant WNT3A alone did not have an effect suggesting that WNT/β-catenin signalling is actively suppressed in this cell type and crucially requires R-spondin action to permit activation of this pathway ( Figure 5D ) . Commitment of renal progenitors to nephron differentiation involves canonical BMP7 signalling , which allows cells to fully respond to the WNT/β−catenin pathway and undergo MET ( Brown et al . , 2013 ) . In situ hybridization indicated a dramatic downregulation of Bmp7 in Six2:Cre-DM kidneys ( Figure 4D ) . Canonical BMP signalling induces phosphorylation of SMAD1/5 and we therefore evaluated the phosphorylation status of this signal transducer . Whereas progenitors in control kidneys that engaged in MET were positive for pSMAD1/5 ( Figure 5E ) , the nephrogenic zone in Six2:Cre-DM kidneys showed a 88% reduction of staining ( p<0 . 0001; Figure 5F; Figure 5—source data 1 ) . pSMAD staining in medullary stroma was not affected by this deletion . Taken together these data demonstrate that R-spondins are required for Bmp7 activation , which in turn permits priming of renal progenitors for MET . R-spondins act by associating and internalising the ubiquitin E3 ligases ZNRF3/RNF43 . Expression analysis using RNA-Scope demonstrated RNF43 to be specifically expressed within the branching ureter , whereas ZNRF3 showed a more widespread expression pattern , covering also the nephrogenic niche ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1 ) . R-spondin interaction with ZNRF3/RNF43 is believed to be primarily mediated via binding to their cognate receptors LGR4-6 and mutations in Lgr4 or Lgr4/5 have been shown to have mild defects in kidney development ( Kato et al . , 2006; Dang et al . , 2014; Kinzel et al . , 2014 ) . To determine to what extent RSPO1/3 activity in kidney development depends on the LGR receptor family we mapped their expression using RNA-Scope analysis . Lgr4 showed the broadest expression pattern with mRNA detected in virtually all cell types of the developing kidney ( Figure 6A ) . Particularly , strong staining was found in the distal part of comma shaped bodies that extended into the intermediate segment at the S-shaped body stage . In addition , we detected strong staining in medullary stromal cells that line the developing ureter . Lgr5 mRNA was virtually absent from the CM , but could be found within ureteric tips , a proportion of medullary stroma cells and the distal segment of S-shaped bodies , as previously reported using a lacZ reporter strain ( Barker et al . , 2012 ) . Lgr6 mRNA showed the most restricted expression pattern and could only be detected in PTAs of forming nephrons ( Figure 6A ) . Based on these findings we hypothesized that LGR4 was likely to be the main receptor mediating RSPO function in renal progenitors . To test this hypothesis , we took advantage of a mouse strain carrying an Lgr4 null allele that was previously generated by our laboratory ( Da Silva et al . , 2018 ) . Quantification of SIX2-positive NPCs at E14 . 5 indicated a reduction by 37% ( p=0 . 0006 ) in Lgr4-/-mutants compared to control kidneys ( Figure 6B , C; Figure 6—source data 1 ) , a cell loss that was considerably inferior to that observed in R-spondin mutants . Moreover , MET appeared to be unaffected in LGR4 mutants as exemplified by the activation of LEF1 in PTAs and the presence of WT1 positive cells in proximal proportion of forming nephrons ( Figure 6D ) . To test whether LGR5 and/or LGR6 may compensate for the lack of LGR4 , we next analyzed wholebody Lgr4/5/6 triple knockout kidneys at E14 . 5 , the latest developmental stage where these embryos can be collected . The absence of LGR4/5/6 had little effect on early renal development and progenitors were able to undergo MET and form WT1+ glomeruli ( Figure 6E ) . We conclude that while LGR4 appears to mediate some R-spondin activity within the nephrogenic niche , the majority of signalling occurs in an LGR-independent manner . 3 Discussion Controlled proliferation and differentiation of renal progenitors is essential for the establishment of sufficient numbers of nephrons that ensure healthy kidney function throughout life . Our analysis has established R-spondins as novel key regulators that ensure the maintenance of a healthy pool of nephron progenitors throughout kidney development and permit MET during nephrogenesis ( Figure 6F ) . Consistent with their partially overlapping expression pattern , R-spondins appear to act in a functionally redundant manner in kidney development and single gene deletion of Rspo1 or Rspo3 had only mild effects on progenitor numbers ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3 ) . However , whereas Rspo1 is present in all SIX2+ cells , Rspo3 expression is restricted to a subpopulation that - based on their location at the outermost cortex - appear to represent ‘ground-state’ progenitors . Interestingly , by E18 . 5 Rspo3 expression is lost from the nephron progenitor compartment , which is likely to reflect the progressive aging/differentiation of these cells . Indeed , age-dependent changes of nephron progenitors that affect their proliferation capacity and lifespan have been described , previously ( Chen et al . , 2015 ) . At late stages of embryogenesis , Rspo3 expression becomes almost exclusively restricted to stromal progenitors , which is consistent with recent single sequencing data at E18 . 5 that highlighted Rspo3 as a marker for the stromal compartment ( Combes et al . , 2019 ) . Stromal expression appears to be important for nephron progenitor maintenance , as Rspo3 deletion in this compartment ( Foxd1:Cre ) resulted in progenitor loss at later stages of development . Renal progenitor cells are thus sandwiched between stromal cells releasing RSPO3 and the WNT9b producing ureteric bud that ensures their survival at later stages of development . In previous studies , R-spondins , and in particular Rspo3 , have been shown to enhance both canonical and non-canonical WNT signalling ( Kazanskaya et al . , 2004; Scholz et al . , 2016; Ohkawara et al . , 2011 ) . Our analysis demonstrates that upon R-spondin deletion direct downstream targets of β–catenin , such as Tafa5 ( Karner et al . , 2011 ) and Axin2 ( Lustig et al . , 2002 ) are reduced in nephron progenitors indicating that in kidney development R-spondins activate canonical WNT signalling . Indeed , the observed phenotypes largely mimic those seen upon loss of β−catenin activity ( Karner et al . , 2011; Carroll et al . , 2005; Park et al . , 2012 and this study ) . These findings are consistent with recent in vitro data that described Rspo1 to enhance canonical signalling upon treatment of a mesonephric cell line ( M15 ) with WNT9b ( Dickinson et al . , 2019 ) . However , at present we can not exclude that R-spondins may also modulate non-canonical WNT signalling , which might affect cell adhesion and migration of NPCs . Live imaging experiments in Six2-Cre:DM will be required to address this hypothesis . The substantially different phenotypes observed in CAGG:CreERTM ( or Foxd1:Cre ) driven deletion of R-spondins , which impacted progenitor survival , and Wt1:CreERT2 ( or Six2:Cre ) driven excision that interfered with MET , may at a first glance seem surprising . However , the ubiquitously expressed CAGG:CreERTM strain completely abolished R-spondin expression in the kidney and thus effectively blocked β–catenin signalling within progenitors . Since β–catenin signalling is essential for proliferation and survival , progenitor cell numbers rapidly declined in these mutants . By contrast , Six2:Cre and Wt1:CreERT2-induced deletions did not interfere with stromal Rspo3 expression , which bestowed sufficient β-catenin signalling on progenitors to permit survival . This hypothesis is compatible with a model in which low and high levels of β–catenin signalling regulates Class II and Class I target genes , respectively ( Ramalingam et al . , 2018 ) . However , the concept of lower β–catenin signalling in uncommitted progenitors seems contradictory considering that they are exposed to higher levels of R-spondins ( RSPO1+RSPO3 ) , when compared to cells that engage in MET ( only RSPO1 ) . This dilemma can be resolved when introducing an additional ‘switch’ that permits the activation of class I targets ( e . g . Wnt4/Lef1 ) once progenitors leave the cortical niche . Evidence from knockout studies suggests this switch to involve Bmp7-dependent activation of pSMAD signalling at the boundary between the niche and committed cells ( Brown et al . , 2013 ) . Since progenitors in Six2:Cre-DM/Wt1:CreERT2-DM mice have significantly decreased levels of Bmp7 ( a class II target of β-catenin [Park et al . , 2012] ) , progenitor cells fail to activate pSMAD signalling , lack expression of class I targets and as a consequence do not epithelialize . We have also addressed the potential role of LGR4/5/6 , the cognate receptors of R-spondins , in conveying their action . Lgr4 single mutants have been described previously to show dilated collecting ducts and reduced kidney size ( Kato et al . , 2006 ) that could be traced back to a reduction in renal progenitors ( Dang et al . , 2014 ) . Our own analysis with an independent Lgr4 knockout allele confirms this phenotype , although duct dilation was only seen at late stages of kidney development ( Da Silva et al . , 2018 and data not shown ) . In R-spondin mutants we did not observe dilated collecting ducts , which might be explained by persistent expression of Rspo3 in medullary stroma using the tissue-specific deletion in stromal or nephron progenitors . Lgr5 was found to be virtually absent from uninduced progenitors , but was strongly expressed within the ureteric tip and the distal part of the developing nephron , two sites of strong β-catenin activity . To our knowledge , no renal abnormalities have been associated with Lgr5 mutations and the previously published Lgr4/Lgr5 double mutants show a kidney phenotype comparable to the Lgr4 single mutant ( Kinzel et al . , 2014 ) . Our RNAScope analysis revealed Lgr6 expression to be highly restricted to the pretubular aggregates and renal vesicle . Surprisingly , Lgr4/5/6 triple knockouts are associated with only a mild loss of renal progenitors that are capable to undergo MET , a phenotype that does not phenocopy the dramatic loss of renal progenitors and their inability to undergo MET correlated with the absence of Rspo1 and Rspo3 . Due to the embryonic death around E14 . 5 , later stages could not be analysed . Taken together these data indicate that Lgr4 , but not Lgr5/6 , contribute to R-spondin signalling in nephron progenitor cells . However , the mild phenotype observed in single Lgr4 mutants and the triple Lgr knockout when compared to Rspo1/3 mutants , suggests that R-spondins are likely to act primarily in an LGR-independent manner in NPCs . A similar LGR-independent action has recently been described for Rspo2 in limb and lung development ( Szenker-Ravi et al . , 2018 ) . Interestingly , an alternative mode of action for RSPO2 and RSPO3 has recently emerged that potentiates the WNT/β−catenin pathway through an interaction with heparan sulfate proteoglycans ( HSPG ) ( Lebensohn and Rohatgi , 2018 ) . In Xenopus , RSPO3 has been shown to interact with Syndecan4 to induce non-canonical ( PCP ) signalling ( Ohkawara et al . , 2011 ) and Syndecan1 has been suggested to present WNT and R-spondins in multiple myeloma ( Ren et al . , 2018 ) . Further analysis will be needed to identify the proteins responsible for mediating LGR-independent R-spondin action in the kidney . The number of nephrons varies dramatically in the human population with a count of 250 , 000 and 2 . 5 million glomeruli per kidney being considered as normal . However , lower nephron numbers have been directly linked with hypertension and a higher risk of developing renal diseases ( Bertram et al . , 2011 ) . Our study has identified R-spondins as regulators that maintain the nephrogenic niche during development and we can speculate that changes in expression levels or protein function in these genes may be associated with renal disorders . Interestingly , the RSPO3 locus has been identified in two studies to be linked with renal diseases including abnormal blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) , a hallmark for glomerular filtration dysfunction ( Okada et al . , 2012; Osman et al . , 2018 ) . Given these studies and our findings in mice , it will be of interest to further investigate a potential role of R-spondin variants in the predisposition to renal disease . 4 Materials and methods The experiments described in this paper were carried out in compliance with the French and international animal welfare laws , guidelines and policies and were approved by the local ethics committee ( PEA N°: NCE-2014–207 and PEA N°: 2018060516474844 ( V2 ) ) . Genetically modified mice used in this study have been described previously: Rspo3flox ( Rocha et al . , 2015 ) , Rspo1- ( Chassot et al . , 2008 ) , Ctnnbflox ( Brault et al . , 2001 ) , Lgr4- ( Da Silva et al . , 2017 ) , Lgr4/5/6– ( Szenker-Ravi et al . , 2018 ) , CAGG:CreERTM ( Hayashi and McMahon , 2002 ) , Wt1:CreERT2 ( Zhou et al . , 2008 ) , Six2:Cre ( Kobayashi et al . , 2008 ) and Foxd1:Cre ( Kobayashi et al . , 2014 ) . Primers for genotyping can be found in Table 1 . For inducible Cre lines ( CAGG:CreERTM and Wt1:CreERT2 ) , Cre activation was achieved by gavage of pregnant females with an extemporarily prepared single dose of 200 mg tamoxifen dissolved in corn oil per kg of body weight . For proliferation assays , BrdU dissolved in 0 . 9% NaCl was administered to pregnant dams 2 hr before sacrificing via intraperitoneal ( IP ) injection at a dose of 50 mg/kg . Embryos were analyzed at various time-points and genders were not considered . Embryos were collected from time-mated females considering the date when the vaginal plug was observed as embryonic day 0 . 5 ( E0 . 5 ) . Embryos from E11 . 5 to E18 . 5 were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) in phosphate buffer saline ( PBS ) overnight at 4°C or at room temperature , if used for RNA-Scope analysis . The day after , embryos were washed in PBS , dehydrated through an Automatic tissue processor ( Leica TP1020 ) and embedded in paraffin . Tissues were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde , progressively dehydrated and embedded in paraffin . 7-µm-thick sections were cut then rehydrated and hybridization was performed as described in Lescher et al . , 1998 using an InsituPro VSi robot from Intavis Bioanalytical Instruments . Digoxygenin-labelled antisense RNA probes were synthesized from plasmids obtained from different sources: Rspo1 , Rspo3 , Wnt4 , Wnt9b ( Gift from McMahon’s laboratory ) , Bmp7 , Etv5 and Crym ( Gift from T . Carroll’s laboratory ) , Uncx4 ( Gift from A . Reginensi , in J . Wrana’s laboratory ) , Slc12a , Tfrc and Tafa5 DNA sequences were subcloned in pCRII Topo vector . Hybridized DIG-RNA probes were detected with alkaline phosphatase-coupled anti-digoxigenin antibody . After washing , the chromogenic reaction was performed with BM-purple substrate for several days at room temperature . RNAscope analysis ( Advanced Cell Diagnostics; Lgr4 , Lgr5 , Lgr6 , Rspo1 , Rspo2 , Rspo3 , Axin2 ) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions using the chromogenic Fast Red dye that can be visualized using light or fluorescence microscopy . Alternatively , after in situ hybridization , sections were blocked in a PBS solution containing 3% BSA , 10% Normal Donkey Serum and 0 . 1%Tween , then primary antibodies were added at concentrations reported in Supplementary file 1 and incubated overnight at 4°C . The following day , after three washes in PBS , secondary antibodies were diluted 1/500 in PBS and applied on sections for 1H at room temperature . After three washes in PBS , sections were mounted in a 50% glycerol ( in PBS ) medium . For immunofluorescence experiments , tissues were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde , progressively dehydrated and embedded in paraffin . 5 µm thick sections were rehydrated , boiled in a pressure cooker for 2 min with Antigen Unmasking Solution and blocked in PBS solution containing 10% normal donkey serum , 0 . 1% tween and 3% BSA . All antibodies were applied overnight at 4°C at the concentrations listed in the Supplementary file 1 . Secondary antibodies were diluted 1:500 and applied at room temperature for 1 hr . For histological analysis , 5-µm-thick sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin according to standard procedures . RNA was extracted from embryonic samples or cultured cells using RNeasy Mini- or Micro-kit , following the manufacturer’s instructions . Reverse transcription was performed using M-MLV reverse transcriptase in combination with Random Hexamers . The cDNA synthesised was used as a template for qPCR reaction performed using the Light Cycler SYBR Green I Master Kit . Expression levels were normalized for Sdha . Primers are described in Table 1 . A combination of anti-BrdU and anti-SIX2 antibodies was used to detect proliferating renal progenitors . Quantification was performed on four embryos ( n = 4 ) isolated either from 2 ( for CAGG:CreERTM-DM ) or 3 ( for Ctrl ) different litters . For each embryo between 10 and 40 kidney sections were analysed that were collected throughout the entire organ . Pictures were taken with a Zeiss Apotome two upright microscope and every kidney field on the picture was analysed with Fiji software . Only SIX2+ cells located in the cap mesenchyme were considered for quantification . The percentage of proliferating progenitors was obtained after scoring for every embryo the average of ( BrdU/SIX2 ) double positive nuclei divided by the total number of SIX2+ cells in the CM . Each value was reported on the graph as a single symbol ( black dot for Ctrl and black square for CAGG:CreERTM-DM ) . Apoptotic cells were labelled with TUNEL kit ( Roche ) and renal progenitors identified using anti-SIX2 antibodies . Quantification was performed on three embryos ( n = 3 ) isolated from two different litters . For each embryo , between 6 and 15 sections , going through the kidney centre ( pelvic region ) were analysed . Pictures were taken for every kidney with a Zeiss Apotome two upright microscope . In every kidney field , only SIX2+ cells located in the cap mesenchyme were considered and quantified with Fiji software . The percentage of apoptotic progenitors was obtained after scoring for every embryo the average of ( TU/SIX2 ) double positive nuclei divided by the total number of SIX2+ cells in the CM . Each value was reported on the graph as a single symbol ( black dot for Ctrl and black square for CAGG:CreERTM-DM ) . SIX2+ progenitors located in the cap mesenchyme were counted in three sagittal sections ( 20 μm apart to each other ) of kidney samples through the renal pelvis and the average number obtained for every embryo was reported on the graph . Three to eight sagittal sections of kidney samples were cut through the renal pelvis ( 20 μm apart from each other ) , and subjected to in situ RNA hybridisation ( RNAScope technology ) using an Axin2 anti-sense probe . Sections were mounted in Vectashield antifade mounting medium with DAPI and imaged with a Slide scanner Vectra Polaris . RNAScope signal was detected with filter 555 and nuclei with filter 350 .

The value obtained for every kidney section analysed is reported on the graph by either a point ( for control ) or a square ( for mutant ) . Each symbol corresponds to the total RNAScope signal detected per selected kidney field normalised to the total number of cells present in this area . Immunostaining with anti-pSMAD1/5 antibodies was performed on 3 to 6 sagittal sections ( 20 μm apart to each other ) of kidney samples , and signal was revealed using the Vector Red alkaline phosphatase kit . For every section , progenitors located in CM that were labelled with anti-PSMAD1/5 antibodies were counted and normalised to the total number of progenitors that were in this CM . Every average number obtained for every embryo was reported on the graph as a dot ( for control ) or a square ( for mutant ) samples . Data are shown as mean ( ± s . e . m ) .

Kidneys were dissected from E16 . 5 wild-type embryos . The kidney capsule was removed and the nephrogenic zone digested by incubating kidneys in collagenaseA/pancreatin mix for 15 min according to Brown et al . ( 2015 ) . Nephron progenitors were purified by MACS sorting and resuspended in Apel medium supplemented with 2% PFHM II ( Protein Free Hybridoma Medium II ) , FGF9 ( 200 ng/ml ) and Heparin ( 1 μg/ml ) as growth control medium . Freshly isolated cells were seeded at 200 , 000 cells per 24-well dish and cultured for 48 hr at 37°C , 5% CO2 . We tested the effect of medium supplementation with RSPO3 ( 200 ng/ml ) + WNT3a ( 50 ng/ml ) or with Chir ( 3 μM ) only .

Very few of the cancer cells that make this journey will survive long enough to form new tumors ( also known as ‘metastases’ ) . However , melanoma cells – the most aggressive type of skin cancer cells – are an exception . These cells will often colonize their nearest lymph nodes and melanoma patients with metastases in the lymph nodes are less likely to survive than those patients without them . Previous studies have shown that melanoma cells arrive at a lymph node and first proliferate in the region at the edge of this organ , known as the subcapsular sinus , before moving to the center . However , it was not understood how melanoma cells manage to survive in the subcapsular sinus . Now , Singh and Choi have tracked fluorescent melanoma cells to observe how they interact with the cells in the lymph nodes in mice . Melanoma cells have ‘sticky’ proteins coated with sugars on their surface . The results show that when the cells arrive in the subcapsular sinus these proteins bind to a receptor called Siglec1 located on the surface of immune cells called macrophages , which are also present . In this way , the melanoma cells anchor themselves in the lymph node . Moreover , binding Siglec1 helps melanoma cells survive and proliferate . In a last set of experiments , Singh and Choi deleted the enzyme responsible for making the sugar molecules in melanoma cells . Without the sugar coat , melanoma cells were less able to anchor themselves and grow within the mouse lymph nodes . Lymph nodes are often the first stop for melanoma cells on the way to other organs . Therefore , understanding the interaction between melanoma cells and macrophages might be useful for developing therapies that could disrupt this process and treat this aggressive cancer .", "article": "1 Introduction Lymphatic dissemination is a common metastasis route in solid cancers and LN metastasis is often associated with the severity of the disease ( Nathanson , 2003 ) . Although the clinical consequences of LN metastasis are debatable , recent reports have described clinically relevant events that take place during LN colonization by tumor cells ( Werner-Klein et al . , 2018; Pereira et al . , 2018; Brown et al . , 2018; Lee et al . , 2019; Naxerova et al . , 2017 ) . Melanoma metastasizes to LNs very early in cancer progression and metastatic cells acquire driver genetic changes during colonization of LNs , suggesting the important role that LNs have in tumor evolution ( Werner-Klein et al . , 2018 ) . These evolved post-LN-colonizing cancer cells with acquired colonization signatures show superior xenograft formation in mice compared with pre-colonizing cancer cells , suggesting a possible reason as to why metastasis-positive LNs are linked to disease severity in cancer ( Werner-Klein et al . , 2018 ) . Moreover , LNs provide a foothold for metastatic cells to disseminate further . Besides lymphatic dissemination to downstream LNs , during LN colonization metastatic cells gain access to the blood vessels in LNs and take a hematogenous route to colonize peripheral organs ( Pereira et al . , 2018; Brown et al . , 2018 ) . Despite all clinically important roles that LNs have in the systemic spread of evolved cancer cells , our knowledge of the early events of LN colonization by pioneer metastatic cells is very limited ( Naxerova et al . , 2017 ) . The distal organ metastatic colonization process is organ-specific and requires interactions between disseminated tumor cells ( DTCs; seed ) and distal organs ( soil ) to reinitiate growth ( Peinado et al . , 2017; Massagué and Obenauf , 2016 ) . Although primary tumors release many early DTCs into the circulation , which are the precursors of metastasis , very few eventually form distal metastasis . The majority of DTCs that land in unfamiliar distal sites fail to survive the hostile microenvironment of the new-found stroma . This inefficiency of metastasis suggests that distal organ colonization is a bottleneck of the metastasis colonization process . To gain a foothold in new landing sites , pioneer metastatic cells require active participation of the host stroma to obtain survival and viability signals ( Mehlen and Puisieux , 2006; Buchheit et al . , 2014 ) . A better understanding of the events that define this interaction between metastatic cells and host organ stroma is needed to identify actionable vulnerabilities of the metastatic colonization process . The current paradigm posits that LN metastatic colonization begins with the arrest of metastatic cells in the LN subcapsular sinus ( SCS ) ( Das et al . , 2013; Jeong et al . , 2015 ) . However , in LN metastasis , focus is often given to post-metastatic colonization events , whereas the interactions between metastatic cells and host stroma that leads to LN colonization by tumor cells remains largely uncharacterized ( Nathanson , 2003; Lee et al . , 2019; Das et al . , 2013; Jeong et al . , 2015; Olmeda et al . , 2017 ) . Therefore , using enhanced green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) -expressing mouse melanoma cells , we investigated the early LN metastatic colonization events and how LN supports the newly arrived DTCs . 2 Results To decipher the earliest metastatic events in LN , we first defined the stage at which melanoma LN metastasis formation takes place . Enhanced green fluorescent protein-expressing B16F10 ( B16-GFP ) melanoma cells were injected into mouse footpads to form primary tumor ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1A ) . The advantage of this model is that it mimics the natural course of metastasis , that is , primary tumor growth , pre-metastatic conditioning of draining LNs , and dissemination of tumor cells followed by LN colonization ( Jeong et al . , 2015; Harrell et al . , 2007 ) , while GFP enables us to track cancer cells even as single cells . Pioneer metastatic cells could be observed in the SCS of sentinel popliteal LNs lined by Lyve-1+ lymphatic endothelial cells as early as 2 weeks after inoculation and before the appearance of any visible macroscopic metastatic foci ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1B ) . Given the cell composition of the LN SCS and prominent presence of SCS macrophages in the sinus ( Gray and Cyster , 2012 ) , we reasoned that pioneer metastatic cells may use SCS macrophages to find an initial anchorage point . Therefore , we stained the LN sections positive for B16-GFP cells with anti-Siglec1 ( CD169 ) antibody , the surface protein highly expressed on macrophages on the floor of the SCS and in the LN medullary region ( Gray and Cyster , 2012; Nakamura et al . , 2002 ) . Of note , by depleting LN-resident macrophages through injecting clodronate liposomes into the mouse footpads , we confirmed that Siglec1 is primarily expressed on SCS and medullary sinus macrophages in LNs ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ) . We found the pioneer metastatic cells in close contact with SCS macrophages within the LN SCS , suggesting they interact with each other right after metastastic cells enter the SCS ( Figure 1A and B; Video 1 ) . Likewise , we confirmed this SCS macrophage–tumor cell interaction using another cell surface marker expressed on SCS macrophages , CD11b ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1C ) . We analyzed the sections from day 17 to day 21 , and found that after initial cancer cell attachment to SCS macrophages , small metastatic foci developed within the SCS ( Figure 1C ) . With the increase in size , the foci exerted pressure on the SCS macrophage–lymphatic lining , which eventually lead to disruption of the sinus lining and metastatic cells entering the LN cortex ( Figure 1D ) . Of note , to test the generalizability of our observations , we implanted an EGFP-expressing 4T1 mouse breast cancer cell line into mouse footpads and found that breast cancer cells also used SCS macrophages to find a foothold in LNs ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3 ) . Taken together with previous observations ( Das et al . , 2013; Jeong et al . , 2015 ) , where LN metastatic cells from different tumor types remain in the SCS and form a metastatic focus before invading into the LN cortex , our observations indicate that other tumors metastasizing to LNs may also use a LN colonization mechanism similar to melanoma . Increased protein sialylation is characteristic of several cancer types including melanomas ( Kim and Varki , 1997; Agrawal et al . , 2017 ) . Using Maackia amurensis II and Sambucus nigra lectins ( α−2 , 3- and α−2 , 6-sialylation-specific , respectively ) ( Varki , 2007 ) we found more than 10-fold higher cell surface α2 , 3‐ and α2 , 6‐linked sialylation in B16F10 melanoma cells compared with non-tumorigenic mouse melanocytes , melan-A cell line ( Figure 1—figure supplement 4A–D ) ( Bennett et al . , 1987 ) . Of note , melan-A cells showed only basal levels of α2 , 3-sialylation . As Siglec1 is a sialic-acid-recognizing protein that interacts with α2 , 3‐ and α2 , 6‐linked sialylated proteins ( Crocker et al . , 1999 ) , we hypothesized that it is Siglec1 itself that is responsible for the SCS macrophage–tumor cell interaction ( Nath et al . , 1999 ) . To confirm this , we used cell adhesion assay . HEK293T cells were grown as a monolayer in chamber slides and transfected with plasmid expressing mouse Siglec1 or empty plasmid as a mock control . We found significantly higher adherence of B16-GFP cells to Siglec1-expressing HEK293T cells compared with mock-transfected cells ( Figure 1E , F ) . Additionally , we confirmed Siglec1 binding to cancer cells by flow cytometry and microscopy employing recombinant mSiglec1 ( ECD ) -mFC protein ( Figure 1—figure supplement 4E , F ) . Furthermore , treatment with sialidase abolished the Siglec1 binding to cancer cells while removing the α2 , 3‐ sialylation completely and α2 , 6- sialylation by one third , suggesting Siglec1 preferentially binds to α2 , 3‐sialylated protein on cancer cells ( Figure 1—figure supplement 5A–F ) . Based on the above in vivo and in vitro results , we suggest that Siglec1-expressing SCS macrophages provide the ‘soil’ for incoming metastatic cells and prevent their washout with lymph flow . With limited chances of survival , disseminated tumor cells ( DTCs ) land in distal metastasis sites ( Massagué and Obenauf , 2016 ) . To establish a new colony , pioneer metastatic cells must overcome anoikis and amorphosis , and resume proliferation by establishing adhesive and signaling interactions with host tissue ( Mehlen and Puisieux , 2006; Buchheit et al . , 2014 ) . As our data confirmed cell-to-cell contact between SCS macrophages and pioneer metastatic cells , we investigated the functional consequences of this interaction for tumor cells . We used apoptosis marker cleaved-caspase-3 and cell proliferation marker Ki67 to determine the proliferation status of pioneer metastatic cells and found that they were in a non-proliferative non-apoptotic state when they landed in the LN SCS , and resumed proliferation after they came into contact with SCS macrophages ( Figure 2A–D ) . To confirm this , we used an in vitro co-culture method . Mouse Siglec1 was transiently expressed in HEK293T cells and B16-GFP cells were co-cultured with these Siglec1-expressing cells ( hereafter referred to as HEKSiglec1 and HEKMock for cells transfected with plasmid expressing mouse Siglec1 and empty plasmid , respectively; Figure 2E , Figure 2—figure supplement 1A ) . Of note , Siglec1 expression did not affect the proliferation status of HEK293T cells ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1B ) . To mimic the non-adherent nature of DTCs , we co-cultured cells in low binding culture plates . Of note , we observed that cancer cells cultured in non-adherent conditions showed significantly reduced Ki67 expression , similar to DTCs ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1C , D ) ( Pantel and Brakenhoff , 2004 ) . We found more Ki67+ proliferating B16-GFP cells in tumor cells-HEKSiglec1 co-cultures compared with cells co-cultured with HEKMock ( Figure 2F , G ) . To exclude the possibility that expression of Siglec1 may induce HEK293T cells to secrete some pro-proliferation factors and in turn induce B16-GFP cell proliferation , we prepared conditioned media from HEKMock and HEKSiglec1 cells and treated the B16-GFP cells in a similar setting as the co-culture experiments . Conditioned media did not affect the proliferation of B16-GFP cells ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1E , F ) . We next tested the role of Siglec1 in the survival of cancer cells . We assessed Annexin V staining in B16-GFP cells after co-culturing B16-GFP cells with HEKMock and HEKSiglec1 cells . B16-GFP cells co-cultured with HEKSiglec1 cells had significantly lower Annexin V-positive apoptotic cells ( Figure 2H , I ) . We further validated these results using a mouse macrophage cell line , J774A . 1 , which expresses Siglec1 ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2A ) . We used siRNA to knockdown Siglec1 expression in J774A . 1 cells and performed co-culture experiments with B16-GFP cells ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2B–D ) . We observed decreased proliferation of B16-GFP cells co-cultured with these Siglec1 knockdown J774A . 1 macrophages compared with B16-GFP cells co-cultured with control siRNA-transfected macrophages ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2E , F ) . Furthermore , we observed a significant increase in Annexin V-positive apoptotic cancer cells when they were co-cultured with Siglec1-knocked down macrophages ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2G , H ) . Taken together , our data revealed a role for Siglec1 in cancer cell survival and proliferation during the initial metastatic colonization of LNs by pioneer metastatic cells . Successful metastatic colonization requires activation of the pro-survival PI3K/AKT and ERK pathways ( Buchheit et al . , 2014 ) . Because these two cascades are crucial for metastatic colonization , we tested whether they were sensitive to Siglec1-dependent cancer cell interactions . After co-culturing B16-GFP cells with HEKSiglec1 or HEKMock for 18 hr , we performed intracellular Phosflow analysis . Siglec1 engagement with cancer cells induced AKT phosphorylation at S473 , which is a PI3K-mediated AKT-activating event ( Figure 2J , K ) . Furthermore , in a similar setting , we found higher levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 ( ERK1 , T203/Y205; ERK2 , T183/Y185; Figure 2L , M ) in cancer cells co-cultured with HEKSiglec1 . We further analyzed AKT and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in B16-GFP cells co-cultured with Siglec1-knocked down J774A . 1 cells . Consistent with the reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis in B16-GFP co-cultured with Siglec1-knocked down J774A . 1 cells , we found reduced AKT and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in comparison with cells co-cultured with J774A . 1 cells transfected with control siRNA ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2I–L ) . Collectively , these results suggest that Siglec1 interactions provide growth cues to cancer cells . Therefore , these interactions may facilitate the LN colonization of melanoma cells . Next , to determine the molecular outcome of tumor cell and Siglec1 interactions , we performed a whole transcriptome analysis ( Figure 3A ) . Compared with tumor cells that were not interacting with Siglec1 , tumor cells cultured with HEKSiglec1 showed differential expression ( fold change >1 . 5; raw P<0 . 05 ) of 239 genes , of which 68 were upregulated and 171 were downregulated ( Figure 3B , Figure 3—source data 1 ) . A pathway analysis of the upregulated genes revealed that tumor cells from HEKSiglec1–tumor cell co-culture displayed enrichment in positive regulators of cell cycle and DNA replication compared with cancer cells cultured with mock-transfected HEK293T cells ( Figure 3C ) . Furthermore , gene ontology analysis revealed that upregulated genes were mainly involved in cell cycle-related biological processes ( Figure 3D , E ) . Consistent with FACS analysis of Ki67 staining , RNA sequencing results confirmed higher levels of Ki67 expression in HEKSiglec1 co-cultured cancer cells ( Figure 3E , Figure 3—source data 1 ) . Additionally , we observed downregulation of apoptosis-related ( Bbc3 , Rras , Ddit3 , Ddit4 ) and tumor suppressor ( Hes1 , Ahnak , Timp3 , Smad7 , Ndrg1 ) genes in Siglec1-interacting cancer cells ( Figure 3—source data 1 ) . Thus , the interaction between Siglec1 and cancer cells drove cell cycle progression and proliferation in cancer cells . In light of the prior knowledge of the vulnerabilities of metastatic processes , Siglec1-mediated interactions between SCS macrophages and metastatic cells may provide the vital support required to overcome dormancy and initiate successful LN colonization ( Pantel and Brakenhoff , 2004; Sosa et al . , 2014 ) . As we observed a shift towards increased cell cycle activity and proliferation in Siglec1-interacting cancer cells , we sought to further explain the mechanism by which Siglec1 interaction induces cell cycle activation in tumor cells by examining the critical mitotic events . To this end , we revisited our RNA sequencing results to identify important molecular events that regulate mitotic entry . Gene expression data showed significant upregulation in cell cycle master regulator PLK1 expression in co-culture experiments ( Figure 3E , Figure 3—source data 1 ) ( Paschal et al . , 2012 ) . This prompted us to compare PLK1 activation in primary tumor and early LN metastatic cells . We used Phosflow to compare PLK1 phosphorylation in primary tumor and LN metastatic cells . PLK1 phosphorylation at T210 is a mitosis-specific G2/M transition-activating event ( Paschal et al . , 2012 ) . We found 1 . 8-fold higher activation of PLK1 in LN metastatic cells in comparison with primary tumor cells ( Figure 4A , B ) . Consistently , in in vitro experiments , we found marked increase in mitosis-committed cancer cells when B16-GFP cells were co-cultured with HEKSiglec1 in comparison with HEKMock ( Figure 4C , D ) . With a reverse approach , where we knocked down Siglec1 using siRNA in J774A . 1 macrophages and performed co-culture experiments with B16-GFP cells , we found that knockdown of Siglec1 significantly decreased PLK1 phosphorylation ( Figure 4E–G , Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–D ) . Taken together , Siglec1-interacting tumor cells showed higher PLK1 phosphorylation than those that did not interact with Siglec1 . This strong mitotic induction observed in Siglec1-interacting tumor cells and confirmed by high PLK1 phosphorylation during early LN metastatic colonization supports our model whereby Siglec1 confers a growth advantage to pioneer metastatic cells . This presence of a highly growth permissive ‘soil’ reflects the high prevalence of LN metastasis in melanoma during the early stages of primary tumor growth , even before metastasis to peripheral organs . Hypersialylation in cancers , including melanomas , is directly linked to the metastatic potential of cancer cells ( Agrawal et al . , 2017; Bos et al . , 2009; Schultz et al . , 2012 ) . In previous experiments , we established that Siglec1 preferentially binds to α−2 , 3-linked sialylation ( Figure 1—figure supplement 5A–F ) . One sialyltransferase , ST3 beta-galactoside alpha-2 , 3-sialyltransferase 3 ( St3gal3 ) is known to produce Siglec-binding α−2 , 3 sialylation in mice and is linked to metastasis and poor prognosis in several cancer types ( Guo et al . , 2011; Pérez-Garay et al . , 2010; Cui et al . , 2011; Chang et al . , 2006 ) . Hence , we knocked out St3gal3 in B16-GFP cells using CRISPR-mediated single base pair deletion ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1A , B ) , which decreased α−2 , 3 sialylation of cell surface proteins by 20% ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1C , D ) . Additionally , St3gal3 knockout ( KO ) cells showed approximately 70% reduced cell surface binding of Siglec1 ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1E , F ) . Of note , St3gal3 KO did not affect the proliferation of B16-GFP cells in culture , in vitro adhesion and migration , or growth as primary tumors ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1G–K ) , but it abrogated the ability of B16-GFP to adhere to a Siglec1-expressing HEK293T cell monolayer ( Figure 5A , B ) . Notably , St3gal3 KO severely reduced the LN metastasis burden ( Figure 5C–E ) . To explore the possibility of Siglec1 expression on primary tumor lymphatic vessels , which might have affected the initial egress of cancer cells from the primary tumor , we searched for Siglec1 expression on primary tumor lymphatic vessels and found none ( Figure 5—figure supplement 2 ) . Next , we sought to explain the reduced metastasis by comparing the morphological features of early metastatic foci and quantifying the proliferation and survival of metastatic cells in the LN SCS . Immunohistological analysis at an early metastasis stage ( day 17 ) revealed that although St3gal3 KO B16-GFP cells are present in the LN SCS , they did not form foci and were not in contact with SCS macrophages ( Figure 5F ) . Whereas , WT B16-GFP cells formed tight-knit foci in contact with SCS macrophages ( Figure 5F ) . We further investigated whether this deprivation of Siglec1-derived signals from SCS macrophages affected the proliferation and survival of St3gal3 KO metastatic cells during early colonization . Ki67 staining revealed that St3gal3 KO B16-GFP cells showed severely reduced proliferation in the SCS in comparison with WT B16-GFP cells ( Figure 5G , H ) . Furthermore , early metastatic cells originating from St3gal3 KO cells showed significantly decreased survival in the SCS ( Figure 5I , J ) . Three weeks after tumor cell implantation , a large metastatic focus had formed in the LN , which disrupted the SCS macrophages lining the LN sinus , but St3gal3 KO tumors only formed small cell clusters , which crossed the SCS without growing in size in the SCS , suggesting a lack of ability to adhere to the SCS macrophages and hence reduced metastatic growth ( Figure 5—figure supplement 3 ) . Thus , overall α−2 , 3-sialylation abundance on tumor cells affects the efficiency of LN metastasis formation . Combined , these results suggest that the survival and proliferation of pioneer metastatic cells in the LN SCS is crucial process of metastatic colonization , and abrogation of SCS macrophage–tumor cell binding slowed down the metastatic colonization considerably . 3 Discussion Melanoma has a predilection for metastasizing to LNs in the early stages of the disease ( Bedrosian et al . , 2000 ) . The high prevalence of LN metastasis early during tumor progression suggests the presence of a metastasis-permissive environment in LNs . Our data provide a possible explanation for this . We propose a model whereby lymphatic disseminated metastatic cells directly interact with SCS macrophages just after landing in the LN SCS . The overall abundance and continuous presence of Siglec1+ macrophages in the SCS facilitates efficient metastatic seeding by providing adherence and promoting cell cycle progression in otherwise vulnerable DTCs . Our model is in agreement with the sequence of events leading to metastatic colonization of LN observed by Das et al . and Jeong et al . using in vivo imaging , whereby they observed that pioneer metastatic cells remain in the LN SCS to form metastatic foci that grow in size and disrupts the SCS to invade the LN cortex ( Das et al . , 2013; Jeong et al . , 2015 ) . LN SCS macrophages have been implicated in anti-tumor responses ( Asano et al . , 2011; Pucci et al . , 2016 ) . We show here another facet of Siglec1+ SCS macrophages where they physically interact with hypersialylated metastatic cells , conferring growth advantages upon them . Genes affected by Siglec1-cancer cell interactions were not only involved in cell cycle progression and DNA replication , but also in apoptosis and tumor suppression . Accordingly , reduced sialylation in tumor cells reduced the efficiency of metastasis . Our findings also suggest how the organ-specific LN metastasis trait of melanoma arises , and countering hypersialylation may therefore prove to be therapeutically beneficial in preventing LN metastasis and subsequent spread to distal organs . 4 Materials and methods Mouse melanoma cell line B16F10 ( ATCC ) and its derivatives , B16F10-GFP and St3gal3 knockout B16F10-GFP cell lines , were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 2 mM l-glutamine .

B16F10-GFP cells were transfected with the abovementioned plasmids ( ratio 1:1 ) using Lipofectamine 3000 . Forty-eight hours after transfection , cells were single-cell sorted on a FACSAria cell sorter ( BD Biosciences , US ) and cultured in 96-well plates to isolate genomic DNA and PCR-amplify target regions . The following primers were used for amplifying target sites by Sanger DNA sequencing to select the KO cell line: forward primer 5′-TCACTATGCGGAGGAAGACTGCTTAATATC-3′ , reverse primer 5′-ATGCAGATTTCAAGGGTTGGGGGAAG-3′ . Forward primer was used for the DNA sequencing . C57/BL6 and BALB/c mice were purchased from OrientBio ( Gapyeong , Korea ) and were between 6 and 8 weeks of age at use . Mice were housed in specific pathogenfree conditions at the National Cancer Centre , Goyang . All experiments using animals were performed in accordance with protocols ( NCC-17–303C ) approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Cancer Centre and in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals . To study early LN metastatic cells , we implanted 2 × 105 B16F10-eGFP or 4T1-eGFP subcutaneously into one hind limb footpad of each anesthetized mouse ( Zoletil 40 mg/kg , Rompun 5 mg/kg ) . Animals were killed at different time points ( starting from day 10 ) to collect popliteal LNs . For LN metastasis assays , anesthetized mice were subcutaneously implanted with 2 × 105 B16F10-GFP or St3gal3 knockout B16F10-GFP cells in one hind limb footpad . Mice were killed at the end of the metastasis protocol , that is . , 21 days for the LN assessment . For total metastatic burden in LNs , LNs were processed as described under tissue dissociation for FACS staining sections . Primary tumor volumes were calculated using the following formula- volume ( mm3 ) = ( L × W2 ) /2 , where L ( length ) is the larger of two perpendicular axes and W ( width ) is the smaller of two perpendicular tumor axes . To confirm Siglec1 expression on the SCS macrophages , LN macrophages were depleted by footpad injection of 30 μL clodronate liposome . PBS liposomes were injected as control liposomes .

After incubation , wells were washed with DMEM to remove unbound cells and 100 μl DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS was added to each well and incubated for 2 hr to allow cells to recover . Next , 20 μl CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution ( Promega ) was added to each well and incubated for 1 hr at 37°C . After incubation , absorbance was measured at 490 nm using a 96-well plate reader . Fibronectin-coated wells with 100 μl DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and without added cells were used to deduct the background .

All images were processed on Imaris ( version 8 . 1; Bitplane ) and shown as maximum intensity projections . Figure 3D reconstruction was performed on Imaris using the surface tool . HEK293T cells were grown in DMEM with 10% FBS , and 70–80% confluent cells were used for transfection with mammalian expression plasmids pd18 ( empty plasmid; mock ) or pd18-mSiglec1 using Lipofectamine 3000 ( Invitrogen ) . Medium was changed to CDM293 ( Invitrogen ) supplemented with L-glutamine and cells were further cultured for 3 days to ensure maximum mSiglec1 expression on the cell surface . On day 3 , single-cell preparations of B16-GFP cells were prepared by dissociating cells with enzyme-free PBS-based cell dissociation buffer ( Gibco ) and passing cells through 40 μm nylon filters ( Falcon ) . Both HEK293T cells and cancer cells were counted and mixed at a 4:1 ratio in DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS . Cells were cultured in low binding plates ( Corning ) for 18 hr at 37°C in 5% CO2 .

Medium was changed after 6 hr post-transfection to DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS . Siglec1 expression was assessed on day 3 and day four post-transfection using Alexa647-conjugated anti-mouse Siglec1 antibody . Co-culture experiments were performed as described in the previous section . For Ki67 and Phosflow ( pAKT , pERK , and pPLK1 ) analysis in co-culture experiments , cells were counted and fixed by adding Cytofix buffer directly into the cell culture , and cells were incubated for 10 min at 37°C . After washing with PBS , cells were permeabilized in 0 . 1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at room temperature . After washing the cells in staining buffer , the cells were incubated with mouse FcR blocking reagent ( Miltenyi Biotec ) . Then samples were incubated with Ki67 or Phosflow antibody in staining buffer . Following incubation , cells were washed and analyzed by FACSverse ( BD ) ; data were assessed using gates for GFP+ cells . Fold changes were calculated by dividing the mean fluorescence intensity of experimental samples by the mean fluorescence intensity of control samples . LNs and primary tumors were mechanically dissociated with forceps and scalpels and placed in DMEM containing 2 mg/ml collagenase ( Sigma ) for 20 min at 37°C ( for LN metastatic burden evaluation , collagenase incubation time was increased to 40 min ) . The suspensions were incubated in 0 . 1 mg/ml DNase I ( Roche ) for 10 mins .

For lectin staining , 1 × 105 cells were resuspended in lectin staining buffer ( 10 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 15M NaCl , 0 . 09% sodium azide ) stained with 1 µg/ml lectin in a 100 µl volume at 4°C for 30 min followed by incubation with detection reagent streptavidin-PE for 20 min at 4°C . A total of 5 × 105 B16F10 cells were treated with 0 . 5 U/ml sialidase ( from Clostridium perfringens; Roche Applied Science ) in serum-free RPMI medium for 1 hr at 37°C in 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity . Control cells were incubated in similar conditions but without the enzyme . After 1 hr , cells were washed in lectin staining buffer and stained with lectin or mouse Siglec1 ( ECD ) -mFc . Wild type and St3gal3 knockout B16F10-GFP cells were serum-starved overnight in DMEM medium . The next day , a single cell suspension was prepared using enzyme-free cell dissociation buffer and 5 × 104 cells were added in 100 μl to the upper chambers of 24-well transwell permeable supports with 8 μm pores ( Corning ) . The lower chambers were filled with 650 μl DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS as a chemoattractant . Control chambers were filled with DMEM without FBS . After 8 hr of incubation , the upper chambers were washed with PBS and non-migrated cells from the upper side of transwell chambers were removed gently using cotton swabs . Then cells on the lower side of the membranes were fixed with methanol for 10 min . Cells were stained with crystal violet solution for 10 min and thoroughly rinsed with water .

Next , the percentage of migrated cells was counted using the following formula: ( number of migrated cells/50 , 000 ) × 100 . To calculate the total number of GFP+ metastatic cells in LNs , the total number of LN cells was counted after tissue digestion . The number of metastatic cells was determined by gating around GFP+ cells and the following formula was used to calculate the final number of metastatic cells in LNs: ( number of cells in GFP+ gate/total number of FACS analyzed cells ) × total number of LN cells . After 18 hr of co-culture of GFP-expressing cancer cells with Siglec1-expressing or mock HEK293T cells in low binding plates , B16-GFP cells were sorted using a BD FACS Aria II or a BD FACS Aria SORP based on GFP expression .

Previous studies have shown that sleep may be required for building connections in the brain . However , it has been difficult to study the effects of sleep in earlier stages of brain development , when stem cells divide to create brain cells in a process known as “neurogenesis” . This is partly because , in mammals , most neurogenesis occurs in the womb . Scientists have successfully studied sleep using the common fruit fly . But these studies have so far focused on adult flies , in which neurogenesis is mostly complete . Fly larvae , on the other hand , are widely used to study brain development and neurogenesis . Compared to mammals in the womb , fruit fly larvae are very easy to access and manipulate . However , unlike adult flies , no one had previously looked to see if larvae even display a behaviour that would fit the definition of sleep . To see if fruit fly larvae do sleep , Szuperak et al . created the “LarvaLodge” , an apparatus in which individual larvae can be housed while having their activity monitored over time . In these lodges , a bright light was used to test how hard it is to arouse inactive fruit fly larvae , and further experiments asked what happens when larvae are prevented from resting . Then , to look at neurogenesis in the larvae , Szuperak et al . used a stain that labels dividing stem cells within the nervous system . Those cells could then be seen and counted when a larva was dissected and examined under a microscope . The results from the LarvaLodge showed that fruit fly larvae do indeed sleep: they have extended periods of rest during which they react less to outside disturbances and adopt a particular posture ( they retract their heads towards their bodies ) . Also when larvae were deprived of sleep , by shining a light or shaking , they compensated by sleeping more afterwards . Importantly , depriving the larvae of sleep also led to lower levels of neurogenesis . These findings establish the fruit fly larva as a new and useful system for studying the role of sleep in early development , and may help shed light on the role sleep plays in disorders affecting brain development .", "article": "1 Introduction Nearly all animals exhibit increased sleep throughout development , suggesting a crucial role for sleep in early life ( Kayser and Biron , 2016; Roffwarg et al . , 1966 ) . Many studies have focused on the role of sleep in synaptic formation , homeostasis , and plasticity ( Abel et al . , 2013; Frank , 2011; Kayser et al . , 2014; Li et al . , 2017; Tononi and Cirelli , 2014 ) , underscoring that a core function of sleep during development is likely to involve modification of neural connectivity . However , examination of a function for sleep in earlier phases of brain development has been limited by the lack of a tractable experimental system . Indeed , there is no established platform to investigate the role of sleep in developmental neurogenesis , which in mammals predominately occurs in utero . The adult fruit fly is a widely studied model organism for sleep ( Hendricks et al . , 2000; Shaw et al . , 2000 ) , and while significant brain plasticity is ongoing in young adult flies ( Barth et al . , 1997 ) , neurogenesis is largely complete; adult flies are therefore not suitable for investigating the function of sleep during initial periods of neural development . In contrast , the timing of these events in Drosophila larvae is ideal . The first wave of neurogenesis occurs during embryonic stages but contributes only 10% of neurons in the adult brain; 90% of neurons in the adult brain are born during the second wave of neurogenesis that is timed to larval stages ( Homem and Knoblich , 2012; Kohwi and Doe , 2013 ) . Fly larvae are widely used to study the neural basis of complex behaviors , and are readily accessible for experimental manipulation ( Heckscher et al . , 2012; Honjo et al . , 2012; Luo et al . , 2010; Vogelstein et al . , 2014 ) . Yet , it has remained unknown whether Drosophila larvae sleep . Here , we identify a sleep state in Drosophila larvae , define the principal cellular controls of larval sleep , and provide evidence that sleep during early development is required for normal proliferation of neural stem cells . Our results suggest that sleep is a critical factor in the initial steps of nervous system elaboration . 2 Results Most prior research on Drosophila larval behavior ( Heckscher et al . , 2012; Vogelstein et al . , 2014; Widmann et al . , 2016 ) employed short-term assays not sufficient for analysis of rest/activity . Building on work in Caenorhabditis elegans ( Churgin et al . , 2017; Raizen et al . , 2008 ) , we constructed a multi-well imaging device , the LarvaLodge , for automated , prolonged monitoring of larval activity and quiescence ( Figure 1A–C ) . We simultaneously imaged up to 20 larvae at 35 µm resolution ( a second instar larva is ~1500 µm in length and ~350 µm in width ) , acquiring images every 6 s under dark field infrared illumination ( Video 1 ) . We focused on second instar larvae because this period coincides with the second wave of neurogenesis ( Homem and Knoblich , 2012 ) . With this system , rest/activity during the entire second instar phase ( ~22 hr ) was recorded , with tightly aligned developmental staging across larvae as indicated by synchronized onset of the second molt ( Figure 1C ) . We observed that larvae exhibit dynamic transitions between quiescence and activity throughout the imaging period ( Figure 1C; Video 2 ) . Our recordings of activity were sensitive to both locomotor and feeding behaviors ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1A; Video 3 ) , demonstrating our ability to distinguish behavioral quiescence from eating . Total quiescence was higher early in the second instar period compared to later , resulting from more frequent and longer sleep bouts in immature larvae ( Figure 1D–F; Figure 1—figure supplement 1B , C ) . These results demonstrate our ability to monitor larval activity over extended periods , and reveal behavioral quiescence that is developmentally timed . All animals appear to sleep , defined behaviorally as a state of quiescence that is rapidly reversible , associated with a postural change , and during which arousal threshold is increased; sleep loss is followed by homeostatic sleep rebound ( Allada and Siegel , 2008; Campbell and Tobler , 1984 ) . We tested whether behavioral quiescence in larvae represents a sleep state by examining these behavioral criteria . First , we asked if larval quiescence is associated with a postural change . Using frame-by-frame postural analysis of individual sleep bouts , we observed that during periods of rest , larvae frequently retract their head towards the body , resulting in a quantitative change in body length and width ( Figure 2A–E; Video 4 ) . Head retraction occurred in 76 . 6% of prolonged quiescence bouts ( >36 s; Figure 2D ) and less commonly ( 47 . 1% ) in shorter bouts ( 18 s; Figure 2C ) , suggesting that postural change is related to duration of the sleep bout . The postural change most often occurred as part of a stereotyped sequence of behaviors: we found in 72 . 0% of sleep-associated postural changes that the animal transitioned from activity to behavioral quiescence prior to postural change; quiescence then persisted following postural change in 64 . 6% of episodes , prior to resumption of activity ( Video 4 ) . Less often ( 28 . 0% ) a larva transitioned directly from activity to coincident postural change with quiescence , or directly from head retraction to an active phase ( 35 . 4% ) , consistent with the observation that posture is more likely to change in association with prolonged rest . Our data thus show that Drosophila larval quiescence is a patterned behavior with a previously unrecognized temporal sequence , and that like animals ranging from nematodes ( Iwanir et al . , 2013 ) to humans , larvae demonstrate postural changes during sleep . To determine whether larval rest is a rapidly reversible behavioral state , we randomly presented a high intensity blue light stimulus ( irradiance 39 . 8 µW/mm2 ) for 4 s to second instar larvae and retrospectively analyzed behavioral data for larvae that were inactive at the time of stimulus presentation . We found that nearly 100% of inactive larvae were aroused ( as determined by altered position in next captured frame ) by this intense stimulus ( Figure 2F; Video 5 ) , indicating that behavioral quiescence is rapidly reversible . Using a low intensity blue light stimulus ( irradiance 3 . 98 µW/mm2 ) to perturb larvae , we found that only ~60% of inactive larvae became active ( Figure 2F ) , demonstrating an altered responsiveness to sensory stimuli during larval rest . Importantly , only ~20% of quiescent larvae spontaneously became active without a stimulus ( Figure 2F ) , confirming that the low intensity stimulus arouses resting larvae more than chance . We next increased the temporal resolution of our system to monitor behavior every 2 s , with the goal of examining whether the behavioral quiescence described above is qualitatively distinct from brief ( 2 s ) periods of inactivity . Focusing first on probability of spontaneous arousal , we found that following 2 s of inactivity , 54% of larvae became active in the subsequent frame ( Figure 2G ) . In contrast , following 6 s of inactivity , only 19% of larvae became active spontaneously; longer bouts of quiescence were not associated with a further reduction in probability of subsequent spontaneous activity ( Figure 2G ) . These results suggest that ≥6 s of quiescence represents an altered behavioral state in comparison to brief ( 2 s ) periods of inactivity . To test directly whether arousal threshold is altered with ≥6 s of behavioral quiescence , we presented a 1 s high intensity blue light stimulus and assessed arousal in larvae that were inactive at the time of stimulus presentation . While 82 . 4% of larvae were aroused after 2 s of inactivity , only 46 . 5% were aroused by the same stimulus if quiescent for ≥6 s prior to light presentation ( n = 108 quiescent episodes for 2 s and 357 quiescent episodes for ≥6 s; p<0 . 0001 , Fisher’s exact test ) . Together , these findings indicate that larval quiescence is a reversible state during which arousal threshold is increased from baseline , and that behavioral quiescence lasting at least 6 s can be defined as sleep . Does larval quiescence exhibit homeostatic properties of sleep , with rebound following enforced sleep loss ? We perturbed sleep using blue light pulses over a 3 hr window , which resulted in 40% reduction in sleep during that time ( Figure 3A–C ) . Over the subsequent 3 hr , sleep deprived larvae exhibited increased quiescence compared to non-deprived controls ( Figure 3C ) , resulting primarily from increased quiescence bout length ( Figure 3D , E ) . Use of a mechanical stimulus to disturb quiescence likewise resulted in subsequent quiescence rebound ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) , showing that this rebound is not specific to the modality of quiescence loss . During rebound , sleep-deprived larvae also exhibit deeper sleep , as evidenced by an increased arousal threshold compared to non-deprived larvae ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2 ) . Importantly , disrupting quiescence did not cause long-lasting deficits to larval rest/activity or disruption of normal developmental progression ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) , demonstrating that increased quiescence immediately following deprivation does not reflect a nonspecific impairment or injury related to deprivation . In most animals , including adult fruit flies , sleep timing is controlled by a circadian clock ( Borbély , 1982 ) . We examined the role of circadian factors in Drosophila larval sleep . Anatomical analysis has shown that clock cells are present in Drosophila larvae ( Liu et al . , 2015 ) , and light exposure in first instars results in synchronized adult behavioral rhythms , indicating that photic cues for circadian entrainment can be perceived at this stage ( Sehgal et al . , 1992 ) . However , we found that rearing animals in constant light , which disrupts the circadian clock , did not change features of larval sleep ( Figure 4A; Figure 4—figure supplement 1A , B ) , including the propensity for increased sleep in the early second instar stage . Behavioral analysis of the circadian clock mutants clockjrk and cyc01 likewise revealed no alteration of larval sleep ( Figure 4B; Figure 4—figure supplement 1C , D ) , suggesting that circadian factors do not play a prominent role in developmentally timed sleep in Drosophila larvae . We sought to use Drosophila larvae to understand mechanisms of sleep control during development , and first examined whether previously characterized adult short-sleeping mutants exhibit sleep deficits as larvae . Surprisingly , mutants for the gene sleepless ( Koh et al . , 2008 ) , which regulates potassium channel activity , and for the gene fumin ( Kume et al . , 2005 ) , which encodes a dopamine transporter , both showed normal larval sleep levels during the second instar period ( Figure 4C; Figure 4—figure supplement 2 ) , despite exhibiting severe short-sleeping phenotypes in adulthood . We next asked whether sleep as larvae is predictive of sleep in adulthood . Sleep amount was assessed in second instar larvae , which were subsequently collected and housed individually into adulthood , at which time sleep was again measured , revealing that sleep of individual larvae was not correlated with their sleep as adults ( Figure 4D ) . Finally , in contrast to adulthood when female flies sleep less than males ( Andretic and Shaw , 2005 ) , we did not observe sexual dimorphisms to larval sleep ( Figure 4D ) . Taken together , these data indicate that genetic controls of developmental and adult sleep are at least partially distinct . To gain insight into the cellular control of larval sleep , we next examined whether the neurotransmitter systems dopamine ( DA ) and octopamine ( OA ) , which are known to be wake-promoting in adult flies ( Andretic et al . , 2005; Crocker et al . , 2010; Kume et al . , 2005 ) , function analogously in larvae . Both DA and OA neurons are present in second instar larvae ( Figure 5A , B ) . We experimentally activated larval DA or OA neurons by expressing a bacterial sodium channel ( UAS-NaChBac [Nitabach et al . , 2006] ) under control of TH-GAL4 ( DA ) or Tdc2-GAL4 ( OA ) , respectively . Excitation of OA neurons in larvae resulted in >50% reduction in sleep time ( Figure 5C ) , due primarily to a reduction in sleep bout length ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) . In contrast , excitation of DA neurons had no significant effect on larval sleep ( Figure 5C; Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) , consistent with the absence of a sleep phenotype in fumin larvae ( Figure 4C ) , which harbor a mutation in the dopamine transporter ( Kume et al . , 2005 ) . To ask whether the relevant wake-promoting neurotransmitter used by OA neurons is indeed octopamine , we conducted sleep analysis in a series of OA synthesis mutants . Mutation of tyramine β-hydroxylase ( Tβh ) , which converts tyramine to octopamine , resulted in increased sleep ( Figure 5D; Figure 5—figure supplement 2A–C ) ; this phenotype could result from reduced octopamine or from increased tyramine , which builds up in the absence of TβH . To distinguish between these possibilities , we examined a tyrosine decarboxylase ( Tdc2 ) mutant that fails to convert tyrosine to tyramine , and therefore has low levels of both tyramine and octopamine . This mutant likewise exhibited increased sleep ( Figure 5E; Figure 5—figure supplement 2D–F ) , indicating that reduced octopamine levels are causative . While both Tβh and Tdc2 mutants show increased sleep compared to controls , only the Tβh mutation resulted in reduced activity , demonstrating that quiescence and activity levels are dissociable ( Figure 5—figure supplement 2C , F ) . Next , to determine whether OA is necessary specifically in the larval nervous system for regulation of arousal , we expressed Tβh RNAi under control of the pan-neuronal driver Elav-GAL4 . Knockdown of TβH resulted in increased sleep ( Figure 5F; Figure 5—figure supplement 3 ) , indicating that octopamine functions in larval neurons to control arousal . Lastly , the OA receptor subtype OAMB has been implicated in octopamine-dependent wake in adult flies ( Crocker et al . , 2010 ) . We examined larval sleep in an Oamb null mutant , and found that these larvae exhibit increased sleep ( Figure 5G; Figure 5—figure supplement 4 ) . In contrast , mutation of a distinct OA receptor subtype Octβ2R did not affect sleep amount ( Figure 5G ) . Together , these results identify OA as a key arousal-promoting signal during larval development . The ability to manipulate sleep in larvae opens new avenues to study the function of sleep in development . Type I neuroblasts ( NBs ) make up the majority of stem cells in the larval nervous system; these NBs undergo asymmetric divisions to self-renew and form a ganglion mother cell ( GMC ) , which then produces two differentiated cells ( neurons/glia ) ( Homem and Knoblich , 2012; Kohwi and Doe , 2013 ) . The first wave of neurogenesis in embryos produces only 10% of neurons in the adult brain; onset of the second wave of neurogenesis , during which 90% of neurons in the adult brain are born , largely coincides with the second instar period ( Homem and Knoblich , 2012 ) . We tested whether sleep in second instar larvae regulates nervous system stem cell proliferation . Approximately 2 hr following the molt to second instars , larvae were sleep deprived for 3 hr using a mechanical stimulus . Immediately after sleep deprivation , we assessed the number of dividing NBs in the ventral nerve cord using the mitotic marker phospho-histone H3 ( PH3 ) in conjunction with the neural stem cell marker Miranda . Strikingly , we observed a ~15% reduction in the number of dividing NBs following mechanical sleep deprivation in comparison to non-deprived controls ( Figure 6A–C ) . We detected no difference in total NB number ( dividing and non-dividing ) between deprived ( 156 . 1 ± 1 . 6 NBs ) or control groups ( 155 . 7 ± 2 . 3 NBs ) ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1 ) , confirming that mechanical stimulation selectively impairs dividing cells without affecting the total reservoir of NBs . To determine whether this effect on proliferation is reversible , we examined cell division in the nervous system of larvae that were sleep deprived and then permitted to sleep rebound for the subsequent hour . Following recovery sleep , the number of dividing cells returned to baseline ( Figure 6C ) , demonstrating that suppression of neuronal proliferation with sleep deprivation is not a permanent impairment . Is sleep loss the key component to reduced rate of cell division ? To answer this question , we developed a closed-loop sleep deprivation system to test for a specific effect of sleep loss on neural stem cell proliferation . In this system , an individual larva was tracked in real time and illuminated with a 4 s pulse of blue light whenever a 6 s period of quiescence was detected ( Figure 6D ) . As a control , the system was reversed to deliver the same total amount of light stimulus , but only during periods of activity ( Figure 6E ) . Sleep/activity for all larvae was monitored throughout the experiment . This approach yielded a dramatic reduction in sleep of target larvae compared to controls ( Figure 6F ) , despite all larvae receiving the same total stimulus ( 53 . 0 ± 0 . 99 light pulses , control; 50 . 6 ± 5 . 19 light pulses , deprived ) , demonstrating the ability to use this system to rule out a non-specific stimulus-dependent effect on cell division rate . Consistent with results following mechanical sleep loss , sleep deprivation using this closed-loop light-based system caused a reduction in the number of dividing NBs ( Figure 6G ) . In contrast , larvae receiving the same total stimulus during active periods and without sleep loss showed no change in cell division ( Figure 6G ) . Collectively , our data demonstrate that sleep loss during development is associated with reduced proliferation of neural progenitor cells . 3 Discussion A critical function for sleep in the developing brain has been hypothesized for more than 50 years ( Roffwarg et al . , 1966 ) , supported by evidence from numerous animal models . Most of these studies have focused on early postnatal life ( in mammals ) or equivalent periods of elevated brain plasticity in other systems ( such as young adult fruit flies ) ( Blumberg et al . , 2013; Cirelli and Tononi , 2015; Frank , 2011; Kayser et al . , 2014 ) . However , investigation of a role for sleep during even earlier developmental time points has been limited by experimental inaccessibility of mammals to in utero sleep monitoring and deprivation . Here , we develop a platform for long-term monitoring of behavior in Drosophila larvae . We demonstrate that Drosophila larvae exhibit periods of reversible behavioral quiescence characterized by a change in posture and increased arousal threshold , with homeostatic properties such that quiescence deprivation is followed by subsequent increased quiescence amount and depth . These features meet the behavioral criteria for sleep shared across phylogeny , and establish Drosophila larvae as a new system to study questions at the intersection of sleep and development . Little is known regarding the cellular and molecular control of sleep during early life . Surprisingly , we find that the most severe short sleeping mutations identified in adult flies exhibit no sleep phenotype in larvae , and that sleep time in larvae is not correlated with that of adults . Moreover , direct activation of dopamine neurons in second instar larvae fails to promote wakefulness as it does in adult flies . Together these findings suggest that genetic and neural sleep regulatory mechanisms might be partially distinct at different developmental time points . What purpose might be served by this mechanistic divergence ? One possibility is that the drives facing a developing animal ( e . g . , high levels of feeding to meet metabolic demands related to tissue growth ) are different than those in adulthood ( e . g . , reproductive drive ) . Sleep must be suppressed to fulfill these demands ( Beckwith et al . , 2017; Chen et al . , 2017; Keene et al . , 2010; Machado et al . , 2017 ) , and perhaps sleep regulatory mechanisms are dynamically coupled to the most relevant environmental cues for drives that change throughout maturation . Notably , sleep bouts in Drosophila larvae are relatively brief , with an average length of 15–20 s . We identify 6 s as the minimum period of behavioral quiescence considered sleep . Though brief , sleep bouts of this length are similar to that described in other organisms , including adult zebrafish in which inactivity for 6 s is also the minimum period defined as sleep ( Yokogawa et al . , 2007 ) . Moreover , the fragmented nature of sleep we observe in larvae is consistent with the idea that rapid sleep-wake cycling is a shared feature of early life sleep across phylogeny: human infants exhibit fragmented sleep ( Kleitman and Engelmann , 1953 ) , and early postnatal rats show sleep bout durations averaging <15 s that begin to consolidate in the first postnatal weeks ( Blumberg et al . , 2005a ) . Fragmented sleep in Drosophila larvae ( and perhaps other young animals ) might reflect high metabolic needs of a rapidly developing organism , raising the possibility that sleep regulatory mechanisms during development show divergence from adulthood in order to facilitate brief rest bouts interspersed among frequent feeding required to meet the developmental challenge . Not all sleep-wake systems are distinct between Drosophila larvae and adults , as octopamine is a key arousal-promoting signal in both . Activation of OA neurons in larvae promotes wake while OA synthesis or receptor mutants exhibit more sleep . Given the conserved role of OA/NE in mammalian sleep-wake ( Aston-Jones and Bloom , 1981 ) , this neurotransmitter may also be a critical regulator of early developmental sleep in other species including humans . Our results are consistent with the idea that sleep control from early life to maturity is characterized by sequential elaboration of regulatory mechanisms ( Blumberg et al . , 2005b; Cirelli and Tononi , 2015; Karlsson et al . , 2005 ) , perhaps starting with noradrenergic signaling . In the adult fly , specific clusters of OA-releasing neurons mediate arousal/wake ( Crocker et al . , 2010 ) . Whether such circuit-specific features exist in larval sleep is not known . While OA serves an arousal function , we have yet to identify a sleep-promoting brain region in larvae . Sleep/arousal centers are organized with common neural logic across phylogeny , where activity of one region dampens the other to switch between states ( Artiushin and Sehgal , 2017; Saper et al . , 2005 ) . Specifically , in the adult fly brain , wake-promoting neurons project to and inhibit activity of a sleep-promoting area ( Liu et al . , 2012; Ueno et al . , 2012 ) . A circuit-level understanding of sleep/wake control during development is necessary for studying sleep ontogeny across species . Given the detailed understanding of sleep circuitry in adult flies ( Artiushin and Sehgal , 2017 ) , the relatively simple larval nervous system presents a unique opportunity to examine how sleep-arousal circuitry in early development compares to adulthood . Most physiological functions , including cell cycle progression and DNA replication , are gated within optimal time windows ( Matsuo et al . , 2003; Tu et al . , 2005 ) . Work in adult rodents suggests that sleep restriction/fragmentation reduces hippocampal neurogenesis ( Guzmán-Marín et al . , 2003; Lucassen et al . , 2010 ) , but it has been difficult to untangle the effect of sleep loss per se from the well-known impairment of neurogenesis with stress of sensory stimuli used to keep animals awake ( Lucassen et al . , 2010; Warner-Schmidt and Duman , 2006 ) ; sleep deprivation paradigms have , for the most part , not controlled for this issue ( Lucassen et al . , 2010 ) . Moreover , the magnitude of neurogenesis ( and therefore consequences of its disruption ) is dramatically higher in early development compared to adulthood . The timing of a major wave of neurogenesis to larval life , a period accessible for experimental manipulation , makes Drosophila larvae ideal for examining sleep function and control during early development . Using a closed-loop system in which control animals received the same degree of sensory stimulation as sleep-deprived larva , we uncovered a previously unknown role for sleep in developmental neurogenesis , with broad implications for both brain patterning and the ramifications of sleep loss in early life . A number of areas for investigation emerge from this work . First , while sleep quantity is greater in early second instar larva compared to later ( Figure 1D ) , the rate of neuronal proliferation does not decrease over this same period ( Ito and Hotta , 1992 ) . Together , these findings suggest sleep might act as a permissive , but not instructive , cue for neurogenesis . Alternatively , sleep could play an important role in initiating the wave of neurogenesis , though not be essential to sustain this process . Second , we provide evidence that sleep can influence NB proliferation , but have not established whether this relationship is bidirectional . While critical to control for more general effects on larval health and function , it will be interesting to dissect how accelerating/slowing cell division affects sleep . Finally , it remains unknown whether the effect of sleep loss on neuronal proliferation is general , or if specific NB subtypes are particularly sensitive to sleep deprivation , which could lead to predictable deficits following sleep loss . Our work describes an ~15% reduction in rate of cell division with 2–3 hr of sleep loss . We aim to develop approaches that achieve long-lasting sleep deprivation , with the goal of understanding how impaired neurogenesis during early development affects brain and behavioral development . More broadly , future work will leverage the tractable larval system to gain novel insights into the genetic/molecular regulation of sleep during development and examine how sleep and neurogenesis are mechanistically coupled . 4 Materials and methods The following lines have been maintained as lab stocks or were obtained from Dr .

Tdc2-Gal4 , Elav-Gal4 , UAS-CD8::GFP , and Octβ2Rf05679 are from the Bloomington Stock Center . Tbh-RNAi was obtained from the Vienna Drosophila Resource Center ( VDRC#: 107070 ) . Adult flies were maintained on standard molasses-based diet at 25°C on a 12:12 light:dark ( LD ) cycle . In order to collect synchronized second instar larvae , adult flies were placed in an embryo collection cage ( Genesee Scientific , cat#: 59–100 ) and eggs were laid on a petri dish containing 3% agar , 2% sucrose , and 2 . 5% apple juice with yeast paste on top . Animals developed on this media for two days . On the day of the sleep assay , molting first instar larvae were collected and moved to a separate dish with yeast to complete the molt to second instar . Freshly molted second instars were carefully placed into individual wells of the LarvaLodge containing 100 µl of 3% agar and 2% sucrose media covered with a thin layer of yeast paste . The LarvaLodge was covered with a transparent acrylic sheet and placed into a DigiTherm ( Tritech Research ) incubator at 25°C for imaging . Unless otherwise indicated , experiments were performed in constant dark . LarvaLodge design was adapted from the WorMotel , a custom microplate consisting of individual wells developed for monitoring of C . elegans ( Churgin et al . , 2017 ) . We designed a chip containing a rectangular array of rounded wells with 11 mm diameter and 3 mm depth . Designs of the LarvaLodge masters were created using MATLAB . We printed a master corresponding to the negative of this shape with an Objet30 photopolymer 3D printer using the material VeroBlack . To mold the devices , we mixed Dow Corning Sylgard 184 PDMS according to the manufacturer’s instructions and poured 20 g into the master . Devices were cured overnight at room temperature and then removed from molds using a spatula . Images were captured every 6 s with an Imaging Source DMK 23GP031 camera ( 2592 × 1944 pixels , The Imaging Source , USA ) equipped with a Fujinon lens ( HF12 . 5SA-1 , 1:1 . 4/12 . 5 mm , Fujifilm Corp . , Japan ) with a Hoya 49mm R72 Infrared Filter . We used IC Capture ( The Imaging Source ) to acquire time-lapse images through a gigabit Ethernet connection . All experiments were carried out under dark-field illumination using infrared LED strips ( Ledlightsworld LTD , 850 nm wavelength ) positioned below the LarvaLodge . Images were analyzed using custom-written MATLAB software . Temporally adjacent images were subtracted to generate maps of pixel value intensity change ( Churgin et al . , 2017; Raizen et al . , 2008 ) . A binary threshold was applied such that individual pixel intensity changes that fell below 50 gray-scale units within each region of interest ( individual lodge ) were set equal to zero ( ‘not changed’ ) to eliminate noise , whereas pixel changes greater than or equal to 50 gray-scale units were set equal to one ( ‘changed’ ) . We then calculated the activity , defined as the sum of all pixels changed between images ( i . e . , the total number of pixels where a change in intensity occurred above the noise threshold ) . Quiescence was defined as an activity value of zero between frames . Total quiescence ( sleep ) was summed in hourly bins ( Figures 1 and 4A , B ) or over 6 hr beginning 2 hr after the molt to second instar ( Figures 4C and 5 ) . Timing of sleep deprivation experiments ( Figures 3 and 6 ) is provided below . Freshly molted wild type second instar larvae were starved on 3% agar plates for 2 hr and placed into LarvaLodges with agar/sucrose covered by yeast paste containing red food coloring . Activity was captured for 5 min ( 6 s per frame ) . Larvae were removed and inspected for red color accumulated in their guts to verify feeding during the monitoring period . 107 long sleep bouts ( 36 s or more ) and 104 shorter sleep bouts ( 18 s ) from six animals were selected for further analysis . Each sleep bout was manually analyzed , including three frames ( 18 s ) before and after the period of inactivity . We noticed that postural changes most commonly bridged two otherwise continuous period of inactivity , and less often occurred at the initiation or termination of quiescence . Head retraction and body proportion measurement ( NIH ImageJ ) were made on all long sleep bouts containing a postural change ( n = 82 ) , measuring the animals from the tip of the head to the end of the tail , and across the body half way along the anterior-posterior axis . Measurements were made before and after the postural change . To supply the blue light illumination , we used two high power LEDs ( Luminus Phatlight PT-121 , 460 nm peak wavelength , Sunnyvale , CA ) secured to an aluminum heat sink . We used a relay ( Schneider Electric , France ) controlled by MATLAB through a LabJack ( LabJack Corp . , Lakewood , CO ) to drive the LEDs at a current of either 0 . 1 A ( low intensity , 3 . 98 µW/mm2 ) or 1 A ( high intensity , 39 . 8 µW/mm2 ) for 4 s through a power supply . We measured blue light irradiance using a power meter ( LaserMate-Q , Coherent , Santa Clara , CA ) . To maximize the blue light uniformity delivered to the microplate , we constructed a mirror box consisting of four mirrored-acrylic panels with mirrored sides facing inwards ( Churgin et al . , 2017 ) and placed it around the LarvaLodge . For light-based sleep deprivation , we used a high intensity stimulus for 30 s every 2 min for 3 hr beginning 2 hr after the molt to second instar . Undisturbed control animals were placed in a separate incubator during deprivation , and both lodges were moved to the same incubator during the rebound . For mechanical sleep deprivation , LarvaLodges were placed on a Trikinetics vortexer mounting plate , with shaking for 2 s randomly within every 10 s window for 3 hr beginning 2 hr after the molt to second instar . Non-deprived larvae were housed in a separate incubator during this period . After 3 hr , half of the larvae were removed from the lodges and their brains were dissected while the other half remained in the LarvaLodges and placed into the same incubators to allow for rebound . Remaining animals were then dissected after 1 hr and processed for immunostaining . For closed-loop sleep deprivation with blue light stimulation , the activity of individual second instar larvae was tracked in real time over 2 hr beginning 2 hr after the molt to second instar . Individual larvae were stimulated with a high intensity ( 39 . 8 µW/mm2 ) light pulse for 4 s whenever a > 6 s period of quiescence was detected . For controls , individual animals in a separate experiment were tracked in real time and stimulated with the same light pulse for 4 s whenever a > 18 s period of continuous activity was detected . After stimulation , a refractory period of two minutes was enforced during which the control larvae would not be stimulated again . This refractory period enabled us to ensure that control ( stimulated only during periods of activity ) and experimental ( stimulated only during periods of quiescence ) animals experienced approximately the same total number of blue light stimulation pulses . Individual larva were immediately dissected at termination of the experiment and processed for immunostaining . Brains were dissected in PBS , fixed in 4% PFA for 20 min at room temperature . Following 3 × 10 min washes in PBST , brains were incubated with primary antibody at 4° overnight . Following 3 × 10 min washes in PBST , brains were incubated with secondary antibody for 2 hr at room temperature . Following 3 × 10 min washes in PBST , brains and ventral nerve cords were mounted in 90% Glycerol . Primary antibodies included: Rat anti-Miranda ( 1:50 , ab197788 , Abcam ) , Rabbit anti-Ph3 ( 1:1000 , PA5-17869 , Invitrogen ) , and Rabbit anti-GFP ( 1:1000 , A-11122 , ThermoFisher Scientific ) . Secondary antibodies included: FITC donkey anti-rat ( 1:200 , Jackson ) , Cy5 donkey anti-rabbit ( 1:200 , Jackson ) . Brains were visualized and imaged with a TCS SP5 or SP8 confocal microscope . An observer who was blinded to the experimental condition manually counted total NBs ( Miranda positive ) and dividing NBs ( Miranda and PH3 positive ) in the ventral nerve cord from 1 . 5 µm step confocal stacks using NIH ImageJ . Analysis was done using Prism ( GraphPad Software ) . ANOVA with Tukey’s test was used in Figure 1; Figure 2F; Figure 3C–E; Figure 4C; Figure 5C , F , G; Figure 6C; Figure 3—figure supplement 1; Figure 4—figure supplement 2; Figure 5—figure supplements 1 and 3 . Student’s t-test was used in Figure 2E; Figure 5D , E; Figure 6F , G; Figure 3—figure supplement 2; Figure 5—figure supplements 2 and 4; Figure 6—figure supplement 1 . Fisher’s exact test was used in Figure 2G . For significance: *p≤0 . 05; **p<0 . 01; ***p<0 . 001 . Each experiment was generated from a minimum of 3 independent biological replicates . Samples were allocated based on genotype or experimental manipulation and statistics performed on aggregated data . Outliers were never excluded ."}

Despite extensive biochemical and structural investigations , how their translocation activity is utilized chemo-mechanically in DNA unwinding is poorly understood . We examined DNA unwinding by G40P , a DnaB-family helicase , using a single-molecule fluorescence assay with a single base pair resolution . The high-resolution assay revealed that G40P by itself is a very weak helicase that stalls at barriers as small as a single GC base pair and unwinds DNA with the step size of a single base pair . Binding of a single ATPγS could stall unwinding , demonstrating highly coordinated ATP hydrolysis between six identical subunits . We observed frequent slippage of the helicase , which is fully suppressed by the primase DnaG . We anticipate that these findings allow a better understanding on the fine balance of thermal fluctuation activation and energy derived from hydrolysis .", "plain language summary": "Living cells store their genetic code written in molecules of DNA , with two strands of DNA twisted together to form the familiar double helix . When a cell prepares to divide , it must unwind its DNA so that the individual strands can be copied . Enzymes known as DNA helicases play a vital role in this unwinding process; yet , it is not completely clear how these enzymes move along the DNA . Schlierf et al . have now developed a new approach to see how an individual DNA helicase called G40P unwinds the DNA double helix . The experiments used a molecular ruler to measure the DNA unwinding and showed that the helicase opened the double helix one letter of genetic code at a time . Also , specific sequence of letters within the DNA molecules could slow down and stop G40P or even cause it to move backwards . DNA helicases work closely with other proteins inside cells to perform their task . DNA primases , for example , are enzymes that create the starting points for making new strands of DNA . Schlierf et al . found that the primase DnaG could also prevent G40P from moving backwards on the DNA , a new and unexpected function of DnaG . These findings contribute to an ongoing debate among researchers with partially contradictory models for how DNA helicases unwind the DNA double helix . Although originally from a virus , G40P is similar to a helicase enzyme found in bacteria . Therefore , a better understanding of this helicase may lead to new ways to stop bacteria copying their DNA , which might one day become new antibiotics to treat bacterial infections .", "article": "1 Introduction Helicases are essential enzymes for all life forms and catalyze the separation of double-stranded nucleic acids ( dsNA ) into single-stranded nucleic acids ( ssNA ) , and many of these enzymes involved in DNA repair , DNA recombination and transcription termination are linked to human diseases ( Crampton et al . , 2006; Enemark and Joshua-Tor , 2008; Enemark and Joshua-Tor , 2006; Gai et al . , 2004; Johnson et al . , 2007; Lionnet et al . , 2007; Lohman et al . , 2008; Manosas et al . , 2009; Pandey et al . , 2009; Patel and Picha , 2000; Rasnik et al . , 2006b; Ribeck et al . , 2010; Rothenberg et al . , 2007; Singleton et al . , 2000; Thomsen and Berger , 2009; Wang et al . , 2008; Yodh et al . , 2010 ) . Helicases are categorized into different superfamilies ( SF ) by protein sequence motifs , polarity of translocation and function among other criteria ( Berger , 2008 ) . Non-hexameric helicases with a pair of RecA-like domains are members of SF I and SF II , and are involved in DNA maintenance including repair , Holliday junction migration , chromatin remodeling , RNA melting and RNA-binding protein displacement . Hexameric or dodecameric helicases are classified into SF III-VI and are key players in DNA replication and transcription termination . SF III and SF VI helicases share a common fold called the AAA+ fold and members of the SF IV and V share the RecA-like fold . Both folds are structurally members of the ASCE ( additional strand conserved E ) superfamily of enzymes that consists of various multimeric enzymes with extremely diverse function ( Erzberger and Berger , 2006 ) . Forward translocation of ring-shaped helicases on nucleic acids lattice is promoted by ATP hydrolysis . Based on crystal structures , two distinct models have been proposed concerning how the hydrolysis of ATP molecules in a multi-subunit enzyme is coordinated between the subunits: a sequential , ‘staircase-like’ model for ATP hydrolysis and a concerted ATP hydrolysis model . The staircase model based on the structures of BPV E1 helicase bound to ssDNA and E . coli Rho helicase bound to ssRNA ( Enemark and Joshua-Tor , 2006; Thomsen and Berger , 2009 ) entails sequential hydrolysis of ATP around the hexameric ring , and one nt translocation for every ATP hydrolyzed . By extension , the unwinding step size has been proposed to be one base pair ( bp ) but this has not been experimentally tested . The concerted hydrolysis model based on the all-or-nothing nucleotide occupancy of SV40 Large T antigen structures ( Gai et al . , 2004 ) posits that the six ATP binding sites fire simultaneously , moving on the DNA by an increment determined by the stroke size of the DNA binding motif , which can be larger than 1 nt or 1 bp . For T7 gp4 helicase-primase , structural and ensemble kinetic data ( Crampton et al . , 2006; Liao et al . , 2005; Singleton et al . , 2000 ) suggested a sequential hydrolysis mechanism during DNA translocation , and with the one-to-one coupling between nucleotide unwinding and base pair unwinding ( Pandey and Patel , 2014 ) , but the estimated unwinding step size is either larger than 1 bp ( Johnson et al . , 2007 ) or is variable depending on the GC content of the duplex DNA ( Donmez and Patel , 2008; Syed et al . , 2014 ) . For the Rho helicase proposed to move in one nt steps ( Thomsen and Berger , 2009 ) , chemical interference data suggest that Rho needs to reset itself after it unwinds about ~7 bp ( Schwartz et al . , 2009 ) . For DnaB , ensemble kinetic studies supported a sequential ATP hydrolysis mechanism ( Roychowdhury et al . , 2009 ) with an unwinding step size of 1 bp ( Galletto et al . , 2004 ) , but DnaB structure bound to ssDNA showed that one subunit of DnaB hexamer binds two nucleotides , leading to the proposal that DnaB unwinds DNA in two base pair steps ( Itsathitphaisarn et al . , 2012 ) . Conflicting data and models call for experiments with sufficient spatio-temporal resolution to detect the elementary steps of unwinding . In the most comprehensive analysis of stepping by a ring-shaped motor on DNA , the DNA packaging motor from ϕ29 was shown to package dsDNA in a hierarchy of non-integer , 2 . 5 bp steps , pausing after packaging 10 bp ( Moffitt et al . , 2009 ) . 2 Results and discussion We probed the helicase activity of the phage SPP1 G40P , a DnaB type hexameric helicase ( Berger , 2008; Pedré et al . , 1994; Wang et al . , 2008 ) required for phage replication in its bacterial host , using an unwinding assay ( Ha et al . , 2002; Myong et al . , 2007; Pandey et al . , 2009; Syed et al . , 2014; Yodh et al . , 2009 ) based on single-molecule FRET ( Ha et al . , 1996 ) . The substrate is a 40 bp duplex DNA with 3’ and 5’ single stranded poly-dT tails , both 31 nt long , to mimic a replication fork , and is immobilized to a polymer-passivated surface via a biotin-neutravidin linker ( Figure 1a ) . FRET between the donor ( Cy3 ) and the acceptor ( Cy5 ) fluorophores conjugated to the fork was used to follow individual DNA unwinding in real time ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . Duplex unwinding increases the time-averaged distance between the fluorophores therefore causing a reduction in FRET , and unwinding completion results in the release of the donor-labeled strand from the surface and an abrupt disappearance of total fluorescence ( Figure 1b and Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . Initial experiments were carried out using a DNA substrate with all AT base pairs ( 40 bp ) and typical unwinding trajectories displayed a smooth and rapid FRET decrease at 1 mM ATP ( Figure 1c ) . Fitting the unwinding time histogram with a Gamma distribution allowed us to estimate a kinetic step size of ~4 bp , obtained by dividing the number of bp unwound by the number of identical rate-limiting steps required for full unwinding ( Park et al . , 2010 ) ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . The kinetic step size of 4 bp here should be considered an upper limit because these unwinding time distributions can be broadened due to molecular heterogeneities , likely leading to an overestimation of the kinetic step size ( Park et al . , 2010 ) . Interestingly , when we repeated the experiment with a single GC bp inserted in the 11th position in otherwise all AT sequences ( Figure 1a ) , a large fraction ( 65% ) of unwinding trajectories showed a stall before full unwinding , with a characteristic stall lifetime of 79 ± 5 ms ( Figure 1d and Figure 1—figure supplement 2a ) . FRET efficiencies of the stalled state were sharply distributed around EFRET = 0 . 52 ± 0 . 04 ( blue lines in Figure 1g ) , indicating that the stall occurs after a well-defined number of base pairs , presumably ten , have been unwound and is caused by a single GC base pair . Individual traces revealed helicase slippage events , where partial unwinding is reverted before another unwinding attempt is made ( Figure 1d , lower panel ) . The lag time between successive unwinding attempts is less than 1 s on average , which is about 20-fold shorter than the de novo unwinding initiation time ( see Materials and methods and Figure 1—figure supplement 1d ) , implying that the same enzyme is responsible for multiple partial unwinding and slippage events ( Ha et al . , 2002; Sun et al . , 2011 ) . In most slippage events followed by another unwinding attempt , the FRET efficiency returned to its original high value of DNA itself , indicating that the helicase slips backwards at least 10 base pairs . Interestingly , T7gp4 helicase was observed to slip backwards hundreds of base pairs in unfavorable nucleotide conditions ( Sun et al . , 2011 ) . DNA with 2 GC bp ( 11th and 12th bp ) showed stalls at two distinct FRET levels ( EFRET = 0 . 53 ± 0 . 04 and EFRET = 0 . 39 ± 0 . 04 ) determined from Gaussian fitting of EFRET distribution of stalled states ( Figure 1h ) . Because the first stall occurred at the same FRET level as observed with 1 GC bp , we attribute the second stall to the second GC bp . Two GC bp reduced full unwinding events to 57% of the traces . Complete unwinding trajectories were even rarer ( 12% ) for the DNA with 3 GC bp ( 11th , 12th and 13th bp ) . Stalls were identified from all traces , predominantly from unsuccessful unwinding attempts and are distributed in three distinct FRET levels with two main peaks centered at EFRET = 0 . 52 ± 0 . 04 and EFRET = 0 . 38 ± 0 . 04 and a small peak at EFRET = 0 . 27 ± 0 . 04 ( Figure 1i ) . The aforementioned crystallographic structures on ring-shaped helicases suggest step sizes between one and six nucleotides , resulting from a staircase like or spring-loaded or concerted ATP hydrolysis model ( Enemark and Joshua-Tor , 2006; Gai et al . , 2004; Itsathitphaisarn et al . , 2012 ) . Recent experimental studies have reported for hexameric helicases step sizes from one to three nucleotides depending on the GC content of the template ( Syed et al . , 2014 ) . For our experimental design , we introduced GC barriers at the positions 11 , 12 and 13 . For a single GC barrier and a ring-shaped helicase with a step size of one nucleotide , we would expect the barrier-induced stalling at a single FRET level , corresponding to a helicase at position −1 relative to the GC base pair . If the helicase would unwind dsDNA with a step size of two nucleotides , and an unknown starting position on the DNA grid , we would expect to observe 50% of the helicases to stall at position −2% and 50% at position −1 . In this case , we would observe two different FRET levels for a single GC base pair ( Figure 2a ) . Introducing a second GC base pair would lead in the case of a helicase with one nucleotide step size to two possible stalling events , one at position −1 and one at position 1 ( Figure 2b ) . Again , for a helicase with a step size of two nucleotides , we would expect two GC base pairs induce stalls at positions −2 , –1 and 1 ( Figure 2b ) . Similarly , we could expect for three consecutive GC base pairs breaks at three positions for a step size of a single nucleotide and breaks at four positions for a step size of two nucleotides ( Figure 2c ) . One , two or three discrete FRET values of stalled states in our data induced by one , two or three GC base pairs suggest that unwinding occurs in single base pair steps . As a further test , we obtained a calibration curve between the number of base pairs unwound and the FRET efficiency by performing the reaction using four different DNA constructs that have m AT base pairs followed by ( 40 m ) GC base pairs ( m = 4 , 7 , 10 and 13 ) , which stalls the unwinding reaction presumably at the boundary between AT and GC base pairs ( Figure 1j ) . The stall FRET levels from the one , two and three consecutive GC base pairs fall within error in single base pair steps on our calibration curve ( see Materials and methods and Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ) . Therefore , we conclude that G40P unwinds DNA in the presence of GC base pairs with a single base pair step size . Recent optical trap studies of the nonhexameric helicase HCV NS3 and XPD observed the long anticipated single base pair steps during unwinding ( Cheng et al . , 2011; Qi et al . , 2013 ) . Here , we extend direct observation of single base pair steps during DNA unwinding to the hexameric helicases . In the absence of GC base pairs , our limited time resolution prevented direct observation of individual steps . However , changing the solution condition from 10 mM MgCl2 to 10 mM CaCl2 , slowed down unwinding significantly and allowed in the all AT substrate direct observation of individual steps , which occurred at similar FRET values to those observed for the GC bp induced pauses ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3 ) , consistent with single bp unwinding of AT base pairs . The GC base pair induced pauses of the helicase imply that unwinding depends at least partially on the thermal fraying of the base pairs due to the higher thermodynamic stability of GC vs AT base pairs . Raising the experiment temperature increased the percentage of full unwinding events for the three GC bp construct , that is 62% vs . 12% at 33°C vs . 21°C , respectively ( Supplementary file 1 - Table S2 and Figure 1—figure supplement 2b ) . Single base pair steps were observed in the presence of GC base pairs or solution conditions which slow down unwinding . Interestingly , structural studies of DnaB showed each DNA binding loop contacting two nucleotides ( Itsathitphaisarn et al . , 2012 ) , leading to the step size of 2 bp . Single-molecule studies of T7gp4 observed 2–3 bp apparent step sizes but with the step likely requiring 2–3 nucleotides hydrolyzed ( Syed et al . , 2014 ) . Therefore , we could also imagine that G40P possesses variable step size , depending on the load , and under our experimental conditions that slow down translocation , G40P may switch to a 1 bp step size . Gear switching was also proposed for other ring-like ATPases , for example the AAA+ protease ClpXP ( Sen et al . , 2013 ) and dynein ( Mallik et al . , 2004 ) . A replicative helicase that cannot easily overcome GC base pairs would be ineffective . Because DnaG , the host primase , stimulates ATPase and unwinding activities of DnaB and G40P ( Bird et al . , 2000; Wang et al . , 2008 ) , we tested the effect of DnaG by forming a complex of G40P with the Bacillus subtilis primase DnaG in a ratio of 1:3 ( Wang et al . , 2008 ) before adding the complex to the immobilized DNA to initiate unwinding . Figure 3a shows typical unwinding traces of the substrate with 3 GC bp in presence of the primase DnaG . Strikingly , the yield of complete unwinding increased from 12% without DnaG to 58% with DnaG ( Figure 3b and Supplementary file 1 - Table S1 ) . DNA molecules showing full unwinding did not show any slippage events , suggesting a novel function of DnaG that stimulates unwinding by preventing slippage . Stalling events were still observed in the presence of DnaG , but were less pronounced ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) . Presence of other replication proteins may further assist the helicase unwinding activity ( Stano et al . , 2005 ) . Slippage was also observed using the 40 AT DNA but less frequently ( Figure 3b ) . Because T7 gp4 , E1 and Rho helicase have higher affinities to ssNA in the nucleotide-bound state ( Adelman et al . , 2006; Enemark and Joshua-Tor , 2006; Hingorani and Patel , 1993; Thomsen and Berger , 2009 ) we hypothesized that slippage would occur more frequently at lower ATP concentrations . Indeed , at sub-saturating ATP concentrations we observed a significant increase of slippage events ( Figure 3c ) and the number of slippage events before complete unwinding increased for decreasing ATP concentrations ( Figure 3d ) . Inclusion of ADP in the reaction did not reduce or increase the slippage events significantly , indicating that the enzyme binds tightly to the DNA in both ATP and ADP bound states . However , the presence of DnaG significantly reduced the average number of slippage events per full unwinding ( ≈2 . 5 fold ) compared to G40P alone at all tested ATP concentrations ( Figure 3d , black triangles and Supplementary file 1 - Table S3 ) . Interestingly , the average unwinding time of the AT substrate with or without DnaG at saturating ATP conditions did not change . G40P slippage can thus be reduced by keeping some nucleotides bound during each translocation step . To elucidate the ATP hydrolysis coordination between subunits , we included ATPγS in the reaction while keeping constant the combined concentration of ATP and ATPγS at 1 mM . ATPγS is a slowly hydrolysable analogue of ATP , and both nucleotides have nearly identical dissociation constants for G40P binding as tested using Mant-ADP ( see Materials and methods and Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) . As expected , the unwinding rate of 40 bp , kunw , decreased as the ATPγS concentration increased ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) . Close examination of the unwinding traces with 2 . 5% ATPγS showed a pronounced stalling event that was rarely detected without ATPγS ( Figure 4a ) . The stall during unwinding was observed at broadly distributed FRET levels ( Figure 4e ) , suggesting the stall occurs stochastically , not at a particular location on DNA . At elevated ATPγS ( ≥20% ATPγS ) no unwinding reaction was observed . The lifetime of the first stall during unwinding was 0 . 44 s ± 0 . 01 s , independent of ATPγS percentage ( Figure 4c ) , suggesting that the stall occurs when the enzyme is bound by a well-defined number of ATPγS . If a single ATPγS molecule is responsible for the hexamer stalling , the fraction of unwinding traces showing a stall event should depend linearly on the ATPγS concentration whereas a quadratic dependence is expected if two ATPγS molecules are necessary to stall the enzyme and so on . The stalled fraction increased linearly between 0 . 125% and 1% ATPγS ( Figure 4d , Figure 3—figure supplement 1 and Materials and methods ) , indicating that the stall is caused by a single ATPγS . A random ATP hydrolysis mechanism as observed for ClpX , a AAA+ protein unfolding machine ( Martin et al . , 2005 ) , can thus be excluded for G40P . The model of a concerted ATP hydrolysis is very unlikely to apply to G40P considering the following results of our experiments: ( i ) The unwinding rate kunw versus ATP relation followed the Michaelis-Menten relation with a Hill coefficient close to 1 , indicating that per enzymatic cycle only one ATP has to bind the enzyme ( see Materials and methods ) . ( ii ) Our slippage data indicate that an ATP or ADP free helicase loses grip to the tracking strand and slips backward . A concerted ATP hydrolysis leads to an ATP/ADP free helicase and an elevated probability to slip backwards at every unwound bp , which would be highly inefficient . Sequential nucleotide hydrolysis during ssNA translocation by hexameric helicases is also well supported by structural analysis ( Enemark and Joshua-Tor , 2006; Thomsen and Berger , 2009 ) and was also observed in ssDNA translocation by T7gp4 ( Crampton et al . , 2006; Liao et al . , 2005; Pandey and Patel , 2014 ) . An optical tweezers study on T7gp4 proposed a sequential nucleotide hydrolysis after analyzing the slippage probability at various nucleotide conditions ( Sun et al . , 2011 ) . Here we show the first direct evidence for sequential hydrolysis during DNA unwinding . Combining our data with the strand exclusion model of unwinding ( Ahnert and Patel , 1997 ) and the staircase model of ssDNA translocation ( Enemark and Joshua-Tor , 2006 ) , we previously proposed that for T7 gp4 , with the unwinding step size of 2–3 bp , a spring-loaded mechanism where the presence of GC base pairs hinder DNA unwinding for each step of helicase movement on the DNA until the accumulated strain is released in a burst of simultaneous unwinding of 2–3 bp ( Syed et al . , 2014 ) , which is reminiscent of spring-loaded mechanisms of DNA unwinding by HCV NS3 helicase ( Myong et al . , 2007 ) and RNA unwinding by yeast Rrp44 ( Lee et al . , 2012 ) . In the case of G40P , the current data showing 1 bp steps do not provide evidence for a spring-loaded mechanism . We therefore propose the following extension of our previous model on how hexameric helicases may unwind DNA ( Syed et al . , 2014 ) . In the ATP and ADP bound state , G40P has a high affinity to the tracking strand . After ADP is released from one subunit the affinity of a central DNA-binding loop to the DNA backbone is reduced ( Figure 5a ) ( Enemark and Joshua-Tor , 2006; Thomsen and Berger , 2009 ) . This loop then moves and contacts the backbone phosphate of the next base pair to be unwound when an ATP binds to the subunit . If the next base pair is an AT base pair , it melts rapidly and the relief of the structural distortion within the enzyme catapults the protein forward by one base pair . Subsequent ATP hydrolysis and ADP release repeats this scenario and the helicase steps in 1 bp/nt increments forward . However , in the case of a GC base pair , the melting step may be significantly slower , preventing a second DNA-binding loop from contacting the next base pair to be unwound because of steric constraints within the narrow central channel ( Figure 5b ) . Here , two alternative outcomes may be possible: ( i ) the helicase can move forward after slow melting of the GC base pair ( step three top ) or ( ii ) the other subunits of the helicase undergo ATP hydrolysis and product release , thereby losing contact with the tracking strand such that the helicase slips backwards and the DNA rezips until a new set of contacts is established to the tracking strand ( step three bottom ) . A structural study of SV40 LTag helicase suggested that unwinding does not occur by strand exclusion and the duplex DNA squeezes through the central pore ( Li et al . , 2003 ) . In this case , the helicase may continue to step forward on the tracking strand without having to wait for duplex melting and may lead to unwinding of multiple base pairs in a burst after several nt translocation as has been proposed for a non-hexameric helicase ( Myong et al . , 2007 ) . At low ATP concentrations , the unbound DNA-binding loop moves forward to the next binding site . However , due to reduced ATP occupancy for this subunit , the loop would have difficulty in binding the next backbone position ( Figure 5c ) . Further ATP hydrolysis in the remaining subunits may lead to a situation of all DNA-binding loops being detached from the tracking strand . In this case , the helicase slips backwards and the DNA rezips again to its original conformation . DnaG has to interact tightly with single-stranded DNA in order to synthesize primers for the lagging strand . Such interactions would hinder slippage of G40P , promoting unwinding activity ( Figure 5d ) , maybe even by an induced conformational change in the helicase . In the case of ATPγS poisoning , G40P showed long stalling events . In such a case , a DNA-binding loop of the subunit bound by ATPγS cannot detach from the tracking strand due to the high affinity induced by the bound ATPγS ( Figure 5e ) . Thus , the helicase remains at the same position until ATPγS is released from the subunit . We anticipate that this model is likely to apply to other hexameric helicases . 3 Materials and methods Single-molecule FRET experiments were performed on a custom-built fluorescence microscopy setup and recorded with an EMCCD camera ( Andor ) with a time resolution of 30–100 ms using custom C++ software ( https://cplc . illinois . edu/software/ ) . Single-molecule fluorescence traces were extracted by means of a custom IDL software . Biotin was attached at the 5’ end of the DNA strand during DNA synthesis ( Integrated DNA technologies ) . Cy3 N-hydroxysuccinimido ( NHS ) ester and Cy5 NHS ester ( GE Healthcare ) were internally labeled to the dT of single-stranded DNA strands by means of a C6 amino linker ( modified by Integrated DNA Technologies , Inc . ) . A detailed list of all DNA strands used can be found in Supplementary file 1 - Table S5 . A quartz microscope slide ( Finkenbeiner ) and coverslip were coated with polyethylene glycol ( m-PEG-5000; Laysan Bio Inc . ) and biotinylated PEG ( biotin-PEG-5000; Laysan Bio Inc . ) ( Ha , 2001 ) . Measurements were performed in a flow chamber that was assembled as follows . After the assembly of the coverslip and quartz slide , a syringe was attached to an outlet hole on the quartz slide through tubing . All the solution exchanges were performed by putting the solutions ( l00µL ) in a pipette tip and affixing it in the inlet hole , followed by pulling the syringe . The solutions were added in the following order . Neutravidin ( 0 . 2 mg mL−1; Pierce ) was applied to the surface and washed away with T50 buffer ( 10 mM Tris-HCl , pH 8 , 50 mM NaCl ) . Biotinylated DNA ( about 50–100 pM ) in T50 buffer was added and washed away with imaging buffer ( 20 mM Tris-HCl , pH 8 , 50 mM NaCl , 0 . 1 mg mL−1 glucose oxidase , 0 . 02 mg mL−1 catalase , 0 . 8% dextrose , in a saturated ( ~3 mM ) Trolox solution ) ( Rasnik et al . , 2006a ) . For most experiments [ATP]=1 mM ( except for the ATP titration experiments ) , G40P [hexamer]=60 nM in imaging buffer was injected to the flow chamber with 10 mM MgCl2 while recording a fluorescence movie . We performed G40P/DnaG experiments by incubating G40P hexamers together with DnaG in a molar ratio 1:3 , respectively . This mixture was then injected to the flow chamber in imaging buffer containing 60nM G40P hexamer concentration , 180 nM DnaG monomer concentration , [ATP]=1 mM and 10 mM MgCl2 . All experiments were performed at room temperature T = 296 K . FRET efficiency values ( EFRET ) were calculated as the ratio between the acceptor intensity and the total ( acceptor plus donor ) intensity after subtracting the background . Unwinding initiation times , unwinding times and stall lifetimes were scored by visual inspection of donor and acceptor intensities ( Pandey et al . , 2009 ) . The stall FRET levels were averaged after visual scoring the stall lifetime of at least five data points . The number of slippage events before successful unwinding was measured by counting the number of crossings of a threshold EFRET = 0 . 7–0 . 8 after box averaging the traces with a time resolution t = 150 ms . All data were analyzed and plotted with scripts written in MATLAB ( Mathworks ) and in Igor Pro ( Wavemetrics ) . Statistical analysis was based on Fisher’s exact test or bootstrapping and performed in Igor Pro ( Wavemetrics , Portland ) . All DNA oligos were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies ( Coralville , IA ) and site-specifically labeled with NHS-Cy3 or NHS-Cy5 obtained from GE Healthcare ( PA13101 and PA15101 , respectively; Pittsburg , PA ) . Supplementary file 1 - Table S5 lists all sequences . \\iAmMC6T\\ denotes the amine-modified thymine with a C6 spacer used for site-specific labeling . \\5BiosG\\ denotes the 5’ modification with biotin , \\3Bio\\ denotes the 3’ modification with biotin and \\iCy5\\ denotes the internal modification with Cy5 fluorophore . The exclusion model of unwinding for hexameric helicases suggests that the tracking strand passes through the central pore of the hexameric protein and the non-tracking will be excluded . Thus , a labeling of the tracking strand might affect the unwinding reaction since the fluorophore would have to pass through the central channel . We tested this possibility by comparing average unwinding times of a substrate with labels at the tracking and non-tracking strand ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1a ) as well as with labels just at the non-tracking strand ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1b ) . The average unwinding time of both substrates at [ATP]=1 mM agreed very well within error ( tavg ( tracking +non tracking ) = 0 . 57 ± 0 . 22 s and tavg ( double-labeled non-tracking ) =0 . 59 ± 0 . 21 s ) . However , the accessible FRET range in the case of the double-labeled non-tracking strand was significantly smaller ( FRET efficiencies between 0 . 3 and 0 . 7 , Figure 1—figure supplement 1b ) in contrast to the labeling at both DNA strands ( FRET efficiencies between 0 . 95 and 0 . 11 , Figure 1—figure supplement 1a ) . A larger FRET efficiency range allows a higher resolution . Taking the higher resolution into account and the non-detectable difference in unwinding time between both substrates , further experiments were conducted with substrate where both DNA strands were labeled ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1a ) . Figure 1b and Figure 1—figure supplement 1c show typical unwinding traces after adding a solution containing G40P and 1 mM ATP at time tinject to the imaging chamber with immobilized DNA molecules . Unwinding begins after a delay ( FRET starts to decrease as indicated by a decrease in donor signal and a concomitant increase in acceptor signal ) , which we call the unwinding initiation time , tinit . Unwinding itself takes a finite amount of time , tunw , during which FRET decreases to the lowest level and the total fluorescence signal disappears . The average tinit ranged from 6 . 6 s to 88 s as the protein concentration ( in hexamer ) is varied and is much longer than the average tunw ≈ 0 . 55 s at saturating [ATP]=3 mM . Therefore , unwinding events can be attributed to the action of a single functional unit of the helicase , which we presume to be a hexamer . The unwinding initiation rate , defined as the inverse of average tinit , increased linearly with protein concentration ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1d ) . In contrast , the average tunw did not show a significant dependence on protein concentration ( inset Figure 1—figure supplement 1d ) . The linear relation between the protein concentration and the initiation rate indicates that G40P is loaded as a preassembled hexamer instead of being assembled on the DNA in situ . Further support for the hexamer loading is provided by additional experiments blocking the free ssDNA end of the forked DNA with anti-digoxigenin ( sketch in Figure 1—figure supplement 1e ) . At [ATP]=1 mM and [G40P6]=60 nM , the percentage of single-molecule FRET traces that show unwinding events was reduced from 42% to 4 . 7% after incubation of the digoxigenin modified DNA construct with [anti-digoxigenin]=0 . 1 mg/mL followed by washing out of unbound anti-digoxigenin ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1e ) . As expected , lowering the ATP concentration , from 3 mM to 75 µM , significantly increased tunw ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1f , [hexamer]=60 nM ) . The unwinding rate kunw , defined as the inverse of average tunw , vs . ATP concentration ( red squares Figure 1—figure supplement 1h ) curve could be well-fitted using the Michaelis-Menten equation , yielding an apparent Michaelis-Menten constant Km = 87 ± 9 µM and a maximum unwinding rate kunw = 1 . 91 ± 0 . 05 s−1 . Including ADP in the reaction increased the apparent Km to 191 ± 14 µM and 272 ± 36 µM at 0 . 5 mM and 1 mM ADP , respectively ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1g and h ) with little change in the maximum unwinding rate kunw ( [ADP]=0 . 5 mM ) =2 . 01 ± 0 . 04 s−1 and kunw ( [ADP]=1 mM ) =1 . 91 ± 0 . 07 s−1 . A fit to the more general Hill-equation to the ATP titration results in a Hill coefficient n = 1 . 2 ± 0 . 2 ( dashed line in Figure 1—figure supplement 1h ) . A Hill coefficient of 1 implies that either each identical subunit can bind ATP and hydrolyze completely independent of each other ( no binding cooperativity between the subunits ) or that for every step one or more subunits can bind ATP successively and in coordination but not cooperatively ( Schnitzer and Block , 1997 ) . It is important to note that a Hill coefficient of 1 does not imply that only one ATP is bound per enzymatic cycle , but that binding of one ATP neither facilitates nor hinders binding of more ATP ( Moffitt et al . , 2009 ) . FRET vs number of unwound base pairs was calibrated with the substrates 4AT4GC , 7AT33GC , 10AT30GC and 13AT27GC ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2c ) . All substrates allowed G40P only partial unwinding , for example the AT base pairs were unwound , followed by a stall at the GC base pairs . The stalling FRET level was determined through averaging over at least five data points at stalling events during an unwinding attempt ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2e through h ) . The FRET level distributions ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2d ) were fitted with Gaussian distributions , yielding a FRET level of EFRET ( 4AT ) = 0 . 73 ± 0 . 05 ( ± σ ) , EFRET ( 7AT ) =0 . 61 ± 0 . 05 , EFRET ( 10AT ) = 0 . 48 ± 0 . 04 , EFRET ( 13AT ) = 0 . 24 ± 0 . 04 and a donor leakage of EFRET ( leakage ) =0 . 11 ± 0 . 02 . The GC base pair induced peaks fall within error on our intrinsic calibration ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2e ) leading to the conclusion that G40P unwinds dsDNA in one base pair step size . Figure 1—figure supplement 2e through h show example traces with 4AT , 7AT , 10AT and 13AT bp , respectively , followed by a GC bp stretch . ATPase activity of G40P was tested using EnzChek Phosphate Assay Kit ( Invitrogen ) . The solution conditions were 20 mM Tris-HCl , 50 mM NaCl and either 10 mM MgCl2 or 10 mM MnCl2 and 1 mM ATP . G40P showed without ssDNA a significant ATPase activity that could be increased after addition of ssDNA ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1a ) . This ATPase activity without ssDNA was suppressed with MnCl2 ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1b ) . ATP and ATPγS affinity was determined using competitive titration as previously described by Aregger and Klostermeier ( 2009 ) . We preformed complexes of G40P and Mant-ADP ( Invitrogen ) in 1:1 molar ratio ( 1 µM G40P hexamer , 1 µM mant-ADP ) . The final buffer conditions for the competitive titration was: 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8 , 50 mM NaCl , 10 mM MnCl2 . Mant-ADP was excited at 360 ± 5 nm , Mant emission was observed at 440 ± 5 nm using Varian Cary Eclipse Fluorescence Spectrophotometer . The data was averaged over 5 s and five data points were taken and averaged . Addition of both , ATP or ATPγS , decreased the emission intensity indicating a competitive displacement of the prebound mant-ADP from G40P . The data was evaluated using a solution for a quadratic equation describing complex formation ( Karow et al . , 2007; Thrall et al . , 1996 ) ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1c ) : ( 1 ) F=F0+ΔFmax[Ltot]⋅ ( [Etot]+[Ltot]+KD2− ( [Etot]+[Ltot]+KD2 ) 2−[Etot][Ltot] ) , where F0 denotes the unbound mant fluorescence , ΔFmax is the fluorescence amplitude , [Etot] the total enzyme concentration and [Ltot] the total ligand concentration and KD the apparent dissociation constant . Both ligands showed similar affinity ( ATPγS KD = 1 . 4 ± 0 . 9 µM , ATP KD = 3 . 5 ± 0 . 8 µM ) . Assuming that ATPγS is a non-hydrolysable inhibitor , an extended Michaelis-Menten scheme with the enzyme either partitioning into the ATP-bound state and unwinding , or into the inhibitory ATPγS-bound state can be used to describe ATPγS competition . The apparent KM , app = α * KM , with a = 1 + [ATPγS]/KD ( ATPγS ) and the binding probability for ATP fbound = [ATP]/ ( KM , app +[ATP] ) can be calculated . The probability p ( at least 1 ATPγS ) =1 p ( only ATP ) =1 - fbound6 is then readily calculated . Due to ATPγS independent stalls this probability was offset by a fitted variable and then describes in good agreement our observed ATPγS -induced stalls ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1e inset ) . G40P and DnaG were expressed and purified as described previously ( Wang et al . , 2008 ) ."}

Thus , recombination can be harnessed to dissect function and evolution of mitochondrial genome .", "plain language summary": "Animals store the main part of their DNA—including all of the genes that are required to build and maintain an individual—inside their cells in a structure called the nucleus . Most of the information stored in the DNA is stored in duplicate , with one copy inherited from the individual's mother via the egg , and the other from the father via the sperm . This duplicate storage allows a very important damage repair process to occur , where undamaged sequences in one copy can be used to repair damage in the other . This process of homologous repair uses mechanisms that are also used in another important genetic process . When sperm and egg cells are formed , the parental DNA goes through a process called homologous recombination , in which DNA molecules are cut and reassembled into new arrangements . This recombination process ‘shuffles’ genetic combinations , making every individual unique—a process of great evolutionary importance that allows natural selection to act on distinct traits . The structures inside cells that generate energy—called mitochondria—also contain DNA , which is inherited only from mothers . Little is known about whether recombination is possible in the mitochondrial DNA of animals . Ma and O'Farrell used genetics techniques to investigate recombination in the mitochondria of fruit flies . One experiment tracked how a mutation that makes flies less healthy at high temperatures spread as flies were bred for several generations . When the mutation was associated with a mitochondrial genome that had a strong drive towards replication , the mutation became more widespread over time , and in most cases , this eventually resulted in the mutation killing the flies . In rare cases , however , a few flies survived , giving rise to a healthy population . Molecular analyses revealed that , in these survivors , the defective genome had recombined with the other mitochondrial DNA to produce a new genome that lacked the mutation but retained the high replicative drive . This new recombinant genome worked normally and was able to resist the spread of the defective genomes . In addition , by artificially cutting mitochondrial DNA , Ma and O'Farrell show that such ‘double-strand breaks’ lead to recombination , signaling a role for homologous repair in the repair of damaged , in this case broken , DNA . Recombination is also possible between the mitochondrial DNA of two different fruit fly species , and this recombination process can assemble long stretches of DNA . Now that the recombination of animal mitochondrial DNA is known to be possible , future work will be required to understand how it works and how it affects evolution .", "article": "1 Introduction Homologous recombination operates in organisms from bacteriophage to human . This includes the mitochondrial genomes in many plant and fungal species ( Rank and Bech-Hansen , 1972; Dujon et al . , 1974; André et al . , 1992; Zassenhaus and Denniger , 1994; Shedge et al . , 2007 ) . Nonetheless , there is very little support for recombination in animal mitochondria ( Elson et al . , 2001; Berlin et al . , 2004; Hagström et al . , 2013 ) ; lack of an identified mitochondrial RecA homolog , evidence of continuous lineages of mitochondrial haplotypes and a failure to detect recombinants in propagated heteroplasmic lines are taken as indications that it does not occur . Despite evidence arguing against recombination of animal mitochondrial genomes , a variety of exceptional reports suggest that it can occur . The remarkable ‘double uniparental inheritance’ pattern of mitochondrial genomes in some bivalve mollusks has been associated with rare recombination events on at least an evolutionary time scale ( Ladoukakis and Zouros , 2001; Ladoukakis et al . , 2011 ) . One human patient was reported to carry recombinant genomes ( Kraytsberg , 2004 ) , and there have been reports of recombinant mitochondrial genotypes in some species like lizard and fish ( Guo et al . , 2006; Ciborowski et al . , 2007; Ujvari et al . , 2007 ) , but these reports are based on single individuals without documentation of parents or origin of the genomes presumed to have recombined . Given opposing observations , such as the introgression of intact genomes from one species into another ( Solignac , 2004 ) , it is not clear whether the cases reported are exceptional , or whether we have simply lacked the experimental power to directly demonstrate recombination in animals . Recombination between small regions of nonallelic homology has been proposed to underlie deletion and insertion mutations ( Mita et al . , 1990; Bacman et al . , 2009; Fukui and Moraes , 2009 ) . However , when precise , recombination can generate favorable combinations of alleles , which , when coupled to the action of purifying selection , could increase in abundance to restore function ( Muller , 1932 ) . These positive or negative impacts on gene function could influence evolution , the behavior of disease mutations , and the age-associated degenerative changes of the mitochondrial genome . Until recently , several factors have hindered detection of recombination of mitochondrial sequences . Chief among these , uniparental inheritance largely limits exposure of mitochondrial genomes to sibling genomes differing only at newly mutated sites ( Birky , 1995; DeLuca and O'Farrell , 2012; Sato and Sato , 2013 ) . Additionally , rare recombinant genomes can be difficult to detect: they can be stochastically lost during the random segregation , and if transmitted , they can be hard to track amid the chaotically segregating genomes . Finally , there are few markers suitable for design of conditions that would select for a rare recombinant genome . Previous work in Drosophila showed that germline expression of a restriction enzyme targeted to mitochondria results in potent selection against mitochondrial genomes carrying a cognate cleavage site ( Xu et al . , 2008 ) . Using this selection , a number of variant genomes lacking a particular site have been selected . In addition to removing a restriction site , these selected changes often also alter an encoded gene product ( Figure 1A ) . One of the variants that lost a XhoI site is a temperature-sensitive lethal mutation of mt:CoI that can be counter-selected at high temperature ( Hill et al . , 2014; Ma et al . , 2014 ) . Moreover , one can transfer cytoplasm between early Drosophila embryos of different mitochondrial genotypes to create heteroplasmic lines that carry both the recipient and donor genomes for multiple generations ( Matsuura et al . , 1989; Ma et al . , 2014 ) . In addition to these tools , characterization of diverged mitochondrial genomes has revealed marked differences in their abilities to compete for transmission when combined in heteroplasmic combinations , a feature that we have been able to use as another selectable trait . In this work , we have combined these tools to create a powerful system in which we can test for the existence of homologous recombination and select for recombinant genomes . 10 . 7554/eLife . 07247 . 003Figure 1 . Without selection , no recombination was detected in a stable heteroplasmic line after 60 generations . ( A ) Mutants at the BglII and XhoI sites of mtDNA used in this study ( Xu et al . , 2008; Ma et al . , 2014 ) . The mitochondrial genome of Drosophila resembles that of mammals . It has little intergenic spacing , and encodes 13 polypeptides , all of which are involved in oxidative phosphorylation as well as 22 tRNAs and two rRNAs required for mtDNA translation . A single non-coding region ( ∼5 kb ) called the ‘AT-rich region’ ( dark brown ) as it contains >90% A and T residues includes origins of replication and some repeated sequences of unknown function ( Lewis et al . , 1994 ) . The genome contains one BglII and one XhoI site in the coding regions of mt:ND2 and mt:CoI , respectively . ( B ) No wild-type genome was detected by Southern blotting analysis in heteroplasmic lines where mt:ND2del1 and mt:CoIT300I were maintained in the same population for more than 60 generations at 29°C . In the heteroplasmic lane , 40 adults were sacrificed and their mtDNA were cut with both BglII and XhoI , and probed by a DIG-labeled sequence that hybridizes to mt1579–mt2369 . The sensitivity of the Southern analysis was measured by loading a series of dilutions of wild-type mtDNA cut with both enzymes from 40 adult flies . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 07247 . 003 Here , we provide clear evidence for homologous genetic exchange between Drosophila mitochondrial genomes under various conditions . The complete genomic sequence of parental and recombinant molecules details exchange events , and several recombinants are shown to involve transfer of a substantial segment of sequence from one genome to the other . We also show that exchange is stimulated by double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) , as is recombination in many systems . Importantly , the success of the selections that we have applied shows that production of favorable combinations of alleles by recombination , even if rare , can have a profound benefit . 2 Results We used Southern analysis to test for recombination between genomes distinguished by differences in restriction sites . A line heteroplasmic for mt:ND2del1 , which lacks the BglII site , and mt:CoIT300I , which lacks the XhoI site , carries both genomes stably at 29°C ( Figure 1B ) ( Ma et al . , 2014 ) . Each of the genomes of this heteroplasmic line has a defect complemented by the other so that the line is healthy but neither genomes is lost , a balancing selection ( Ma et al . , 2014 ) . Recombination should produce wild-type genomes distinguished by the presence of both restriction sites and consequent production of a ∼1 . 6-kb fragment upon cutting with both BglII and XhoI . Even after maintenance of this line for more than 60 generations , this 1 . 6 kb band was not detected ( Figure 1B ) . Reconstruction shows that this Southern assay can detect recombinant molecules at the level of 1 in 1000 ( Figure 1B ) . Thus , like related experiments by others ( Hagström et al . , 2013 ) , this physical assay failed to detect recombination . We conclude that recombination in this situation is not frequent ( Sato et al . , 2005 ) . We then developed methods to genetically select for recombinant mitochondrial genomes in the hopes that such approaches would both detect its occurrence and allow isolation of the recombination product . To give recombinant genomes an advantage , we produced a heteroplasmic line wherein one genome was compromised by a temperature-sensitive mutation and the other was compromised in its ability to compete for transmission . A temperature-sensitive genome with two mutations , mt:ND2del1 + mt:CoIT300I , was introduced into a strain with a genome named ATP6[1] ( Celotto et al . , 2006 , 2011 ) . High temperature , 29°C , selected against the mt:CoIT300I allele , and in previously analyzed heteroplasmic lines where the partner genome was a closely related wild-type genome , this selection resulted in a multi-generational decline of the temperature-sensitive genome and its eventual elimination ( Ma et al . , 2014 ) . To our surprise , when in competition with the ATP6[1] genome , which is distinguished by numerous sequence polymorphisms and a shorter AT-rich region , the temperature-sensitive genome displaced the ATP6[1] genome over a few generations at 29°C , even though the flies homoplasmic for ATP6[1] are relatively healthy and apparently more robust than mt:ND2del1 + mt:CoIT300I flies at both temperatures . The decline of ATP6[1] leaves the temperature-sensitive genome without complementing mt:CoI activity , and the entire population dies after several generations ( Figure 2A ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 07247 . 004Figure 2 . Selection revealed homologous recombination in a heteroplasmic line containing the ATP6[1] genome and the temperature-sensitive double-mutant: mt:ND2del1 + mt:CoIT300I .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 07247 . 005 To select for possible recombinant genomes , we followed five independently established lines with a high starting proportion of ATP6[1] genomes ( 50–90% ) at 29°C . Initially , all the lines were healthy and grew productively , but with decline in ATP6[1] abundance , the health of the lines held at 29°C declined abruptly after five or six generations and died out within the next few generations . One line went through a similar crisis with diminished survival , recovered and continued to produce viable progeny in subsequent generations . Southern analysis showed emergence of a new genotype , which was cut by XhoI ( like the ATP6[1] genome ) , but had a long AT-rich region ( like the double mutant ) ( Figure 2B ) . To map recombination sites , we sequenced the parental and recombinant genomes using the PacBio single molecule real-time sequencing technique ( SMRT ) , whose long reads gave us unambiguous sequence that included the repeats of the 5 kb highly AT-rich noncoding region ( Figure 1A and Figure 2 ) . Complete sequences of these genomes revealed that the two parental genomes differed by more than 100 SNPs plus >20 indels , and the ATP6[1] genome lacked ∼1 . 6 kb of the AT-rich region that was present in the mt:ND2del1 + mt:CoIT300I genome ( Figure 2C and Figure 2—figure supplement 1A ) . The recombinant genome was the result of an exchange of a large continuous segment to produce an ∼60%/40% chimera of the ATP6[1] and mt:ND2del1 + mt:CoIT300I genomes that lacks the mt:ND2 and mt:CoI mutations but contains the non-coding region of the mt:ND2del1 + mt:CoIT300I genome ( Figure 2C ) . Southern analysis also showed the abundance of the recombinant genome at later stages of the selection . After generation 6 , the original ATP6[1] genome was no longer detected ( Figure 2B ) , and a new heteroplasmic line was formed with the other parental genome mt:ND2del1 + mt:CoIT300I and the recombinant genome . This line was viable at 29°C as the temperature-sensitive defect of the double mutant is complemented by the ATP6[1] mt:CoI of the recombinant genome ( Figure 2D ) . Over subsequent generations , a multigenerational selection for function caused an increase in the proportion of the recombinant genome ( Figure 2B ) , showing that it had lost the transmission disadvantage of the parental ATP6[1] genome . This led us to conclude that the ability to compete for transmission is localized to the sequences of the recombinant that came from the temperature-sensitive genome . This includes the entire AT-rich regulatory region and some flanking sequences distinguished by three SNPs ( Figure 2C ) . We later isolated two other recombinant genomes by following another 46 heteroplasmic lines as above . Both recombinants had a size ( ∼19 . 5 kb ) similar to the temperature-sensitive genome , implying that mt:ND2del1 + mt:CoIT300I was the source of the regulatory region . By sequencing the coding region , we show that one recombinant has the entire coding sequence of the ATP6[1] genome , whereas the other contains a much smaller segment of ATP6[1] extending at least from mt671 to mt5978 , with the rest of the coding region belonging to the mt:ND2del1 + mt:CoIT300I genome ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1B ) . We conclude that our selection has isolated recombinant genomes including extensive stretches of sequence originating from the parental genomes and exhibiting functional traits of these parental genomes . Normal meiotic recombination is induced by DSBs and studies in many contexts have suggested that DSBs , whether experimentally produced or secondary to DNA damage , greatly stimulates recombination . Indeed , DSBs are thought to be the key initiators of homologous exchange . To test the importance of DSBs for mtDNA recombination , we set up a condition to select for recombination in conjunction with restriction cutting of the mtDNA . We had produced genomes that lacked the XhoI site , mt:CoIR301Q , or the BglII site , mt:ND2del1 . While each genome is resistant to one enzyme , expression of mito-BglII and mito-XhoI simultaneously in the germline should cut either of these genomes . Indeed , germline expression of both enzymes in flies that were homoplasmic for either mt:ND2del1 or mt:CoIR301Q led to sterility in females ( Figure 3A ) . As previously shown , resistance ought to emerge at a low frequency due to mutations at the second restriction site ( Xu et al . , 2008 ) . Indeed , upon selection ∼1% of the females were weakly fertile , giving a few escaper F1 progeny harboring a variety of mutant alleles that inactivate the remaining restriction site . In contrast , even though the combination of enzymes was able to select against both genotypes , when flies were heteroplasmic for the two genomes ( in a 50:50 ratio ) , fertile females were very frequent ( >90% ) , and most ( 60% ) were as fecund as wild type . PCR , DNA sequencing , and phenotypic analysis showed that these progeny carried a single genome with the restriction-resistant alleles found in the two parents ( Figure 3A ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 07247 . 006Figure 3 . Introducing DSBs into both parental genomes vastly induces homologous recombination in two heteroplasmic lines . ( A ) Expression of both mito-BglII and mito-XhoI enzymes in the germline effectively sterilizes most females carrying either mt:ND2del1 or mt:CoIR301Q genome , resistant to only one of the enzymes , but resistant progeny appear at a much higher frequency if the female carries both types of sensitive genomes . The resistant progeny from the heteroplasmic parent are homoplasmic for a newly generated recombinant genotype carrying both parental alleles: mt:ND2del1 + mt:CoIR301Q . ( B ) The same level of rescue was observed when a different heteroplasmic line was used , which had a different starting ratio of two parental genomes . Results are means ±SD ( n = 4 × 100 for each heteroplasmic line ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 07247 . 006 A second heteroplasmic line where the mt:CoIR301Q allele was replaced with the mt:CoIT300I allele gave a similar frequency of recombinant progeny , even though the starting ratio for the two parental genomes was not equal ( Figure 3B ) . The resulting recombinant lines exhibited the phenotypes expected for the input alleles . For instance , mt:ND2del1 + mt:CoIR301Q flies were male sterile , and mt:ND2del1 + mt:CoIT300I flies were temperature lethal . The success of a second and very different selection confirms that homologous exchange between mitochondrial genomes can occur . Most females exposed to the restriction enzyme selection were fertile , while in the selection without DSBs ( above , Figure 2 ) , the recombinant emerged from a population over several generations of selection . The difference suggests that the frequency of recombination upon expression of the two restriction enzymes is much higher . We propose that DSBs produced by restriction enzyme cutting induces exchange as well as selecting for the products that are resistant to cutting . To test whether recombination could also occur in somatic tissues , we examined the consequence of expressing both restriction enzymes in the developing eye under the control of ey:GAL4 driver . The high level of expression that occurs at 29°C results in pupal lethality ( headless phenotype ) in 99% flies that are homoplasmic for mitochondrial genomes mutant at only one site and the few survivors are eyeless or have a small eye phenotype . Similar expression in flies heteroplasmic for the two mutant genomes gave survivors at 10% with most survivors showing well-developed eyes ( Supplementary file 1 ) , suggesting that recombination of mtDNA also occurred in somatic tissues exposed to the double restriction enzyme selection . Somatically , active recombination could impact the stability of the mitochondrial genome in the soma , a factor thought to be important in aging ( Cortopassi et al . , 1992; Liu et al . , 1998; Cao et al . , 2001; Bender et al . , 2006 ) . Given the high frequency of recovered recombinants when both genomes of a heteroplasmic strain were cut , we asked whether we could detect recombination if DSBs were introduced into only one genome . To do this , we made a heteroplasmic line containing the wild-type genome and the temperature-sensitive double-mutant mt:ND2del1 + mt:CoIT300I , and used expression of restriction enzyme to select against wild-type genome and used the temperature-dependent selection against the double mutant . When we expressed mito-BglII in the germline while keeping the flies at 29°C , about 14 . 6% of the F1 females were viable and fertile ( Figure 4A ) . PCR analysis and restriction digestion showed that the progeny had lost the wild-type allele of mt:ND2 , which was targeted by the restriction enzyme , but they were heteroplasmic for a new mt:ND2del1 genome and the double-mutant parental mt:ND2del1 + mt:CoIT300I genome ( Figure 4A ) . Apparently , the wild-type mtDNA was cut and homologous repair or exchange using the mutant mt:ND2del1 sequence led to loss of the site . Initially , the abundance of the newly generated mt:ND2del1 genome was very low in all the progeny ( Figure 4B ) , probably because only a small fraction of the wild-type genomes underwent homologous exchange . However , because a low level of the recombinant genome is sufficient to rescue the temperature-sensitive phenotype of mt:ND2del1 + mt:CoIT300I , this low level of recombinant genome supported production of fertile heteroplasmic flies . Since the more functional mt:ND2del1 genome has a selective advantage at 29°C , its abundance increased over subsequent generations ( Figure 4B ) , and in some lineages , the mt:ND2del1 + mt:CoIT300I genome was completely eliminated after 18 generations ( Ma et al . , 2014 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 07247 . 007Figure 4 . Homology-dependent conversion of the wild-type BglII site into the sequence of the mt:ND2del1 allele following cutting of the BglII site . ( A ) Expression of mito-BglII in the germline of flies heteroplasmic for wild-type and mt:ND2del1 + mt:CoIT300I genomes at 29°C led to isolation of progeny with repaired wild-type genome at the BglII site and converted it to mt:ND2del1 . ( B ) The starting abundance for the newly generated mt:ND2del1 was low , but it increased over generations as the genome possessed a selective advantage at 29°C . The abundance of mt:ND2del1 was measured by PCR amplifying a mtDNA region ( mt1826–mt2496 ) using mtDNA from 40 adults as template followed by restriction digestion using XhoI in four heteroplasmic lineages from generation 1 to 3 . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 07247 . 007 Again , we isolated recombinant genomes at a relatively high frequency , which leads us to propose that a single DSB is sufficient to promote recombination ( see ‘Discussion’ ) . However , we note that without additional markers , we could do little to characterize the nature of the exchange events . In order to study whether DSB-induced exchanges involve restricted local repair events , or exchange of longer stretches of DNA , we needed more markers . To achieve this , we examined recombination between the diverged mitochondrial genomes of Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila yakuba . We made a heteroplasmic D . melanogaster line in which the D . yakuba mtDNA is sensitive to BglII and the D . melanogaster genome is sensitive to XhoI ( see ‘Materials and methods’ ) ( Figure 5A ) . Within the coding sequences , the D . yakuba genome shared about 93% sequence identity with mt:ND2del1 , while the non-coding AT-rich sequence was highly diverged and reduced to about 1 kb in length . We introduced DSBs into both genomes by germline expression of mito-BglII and mito-XhoI and found that about 10% of the females were fertile . Progeny homoplasmic for recombinant genomes were recovered . All propagating recombinants contained the AT-rich region of the D . melanogaster genome ( assessed by Southern analysis , Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) , which we expected because D . melanogaster genomes outcompete D . yakuba genomes very quickly when co-resident ( H Ma and PH O'Farrell , unpublished ) . We characterized the mitochondrial genomes of three progeny lines by PCR and standard sequencing . All the recombinant genomes had one crossover point very close to but upstream of the XhoI site of the mt:ND2del1 genome ( Figure 5B ) . A second crossover is considerably downstream: in two of the recombinants , the other crossover occurred between markers at mt3124 and 3184 , and between markers at mt3379 and 3445 . In the third case , the other crossover is further downstream and we obtained mixed sequencing signals for a region between mt5524 and mt6291 ( Figure 5C ) . Flies were likely to be heteroplasmic for that particular region as if multiple recombinants are carried in this line . Based on these recombinants , we concluded that homology-based repair of DSBs promoted exchange of a substantial uninterrupted stretch of sequence . We also note that there were no discontinuities in the mapped region of exchange as might occur if repair randomly converted mismatches in heteroduplex in one direction or the other ( see below for more discussion ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 07247 . 008Figure 5 . Exchange between two mitochondrial genomes of different species that share 93% sequence homology . ( A ) A heteroplasmic line containing both a Drosophila yakuba ( mt:ND1R274W ) genome and a Drosophila melanogaster ( mt:ND2del1 ) genome was made . 90% of heteroplasmic females induced to express both mito-BglII and mito-XhoI enzymes in the germline were sterile , but the escaper progeny from the fertile females contained newly generated recombinant genotypes .

Southern Blot analysis of the long EcoRI segment covering the AT-rich region of two parental genomes ( D . yakuba mt:ND1R274W and D . melanogaster mt:ND2del1 ) and three recombinant genomes . None of the recombinant genomes ( three left lanes ) carry the short ( 7 . 3 kb ) EcoRI fragment produced from the AT-rich region of the D . yakuba mtDNA ( rightmost lane ) . We conclude that all the recombinants carry the D . melanogaster AT-rich region and attribute the shift in the size of the fragment ( from 11 . 5 to 13 . 3 kb ) in recombinant 3 to loss of the EcoRI site at position 5343 as demonstrated by sequencing . The probe used recognizes mt1579–mt2369 . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 07247 . 009 3 Discussion Multiple modes of homology-dependent exchange are used in different organisms and different situations . Though differing in their details , these different modes often involve DNA breaks of one or both strands , resection of ends , heteroduplex formation , local replication , and resolution . Some features of the processes contributing to mtDNA recombination can be inferred from the sequence of three D . melanogaster/D . yakuba recombinants that we isolated following introduction of DSBs . In all cases , one crossover point was very close to the cleavage site of XhoI , indicating stimulation of exchange by DSBs . Some resection ( 8–44 bp ) must have occurred as the sites of exchange are located two or three SNPs upstream of the cleavage site ( Figure 5B ) . Surprisingly , the actual exchange events occur in sequences with frequent interruptions of homology such that one of the exchanges occurred within a stretch of only 11 bases of homology . In contrast , some of the more thoroughly characterized homology-dependent mechanisms such as those catalyzed by RecB-C and RecF require significantly greater homology ( 23–27 bp and 44–90 bp , respectively ) ( Shen and Huang , 1986 ) . This discordance favors other mechanisms such as break-induced recombination ( BIR ) , a template switching mechanism of recombination , which can use very short regions of homology in an exchange process referred to as microhomology-mediated BIR ( Hastings et al . , 2009; Anand et al . , 2014 ) , to be the underlying mechanism . The second site of exchange is far from either cleavage site , but seems to occur in regions with high homology . It is not clear whether both exchanges occur at the same time: since the genomes are circular , some types of exchange will produce a dimer circle that might resolve by an intramolecular recombination event at a later time . Our finding that one of our recombinant lines carried more than one recombinant genome with a common point of exchange near the XhoI cleavage site but different downstream points of exchange is consistent with this possibility . If separated in time , propagation of the unresolved product of the first recombination could give a population of molecules and independent resolution events could give a mixed population . While these analyses give us only a limited perspective on the mechanism of recombination , it is notable that the abundant SNPs suggest that each of the characterized events involved exchange of a substantial segment without interruptions ( at least 1 kb ) , rather than restricted local repair . When no DSBs were introduced by restriction enzymes in lines heteroplasmic for ATP6[1] and mt:ND2del1 + mt:CoIT300I , all of the recombinants again involved the exchange of a substantial and continuous stretch of sequence ( at least 5 kb ) , indicating either the exchange of extended region of duplex or priming of an extended stretch of replication template by a second genome . We also noted that two of the three recombinants had a crossover site very close to where the Drosophila mTERF ( DmTTF ) binds ( mt6314–mt6341 and mt11698–mt11725 , respectively [Roberti et al . , 2003] ) . Although a relatively weak association , we call attention to it because mtDNA replication pauses at the DmTTF binding sites ( Jõers et al . , 2013 ) , and such pauses might destabilize forks and promote exchange . Homologous recombination plays major roles in repairing DSBs and in genetic exchange . Below , we discuss the significance of these two roles for maintaining mitochondrial genomes in natural populations . Our finding that restriction cutting gives frequent recombinant products demonstrates that this process is active in the repair of these DSBs in mtDNA . While genetically distinct genomes in heteroplasmic flies provide the means to detect homologous exchange , sibling molecules ought to have a greater opportunity to guide homology-dependent repair as they will occur , at least transiently , in the same mitochondrion or nucleoid . In homoplasmic flies , accurate repair using sibling molecules will leave no trace . Only misaligned intra-molecular recombination between repeats would give a clear signature . Occurrence of recombination junctions in regions of low homology in this study supports suggestions that non-allelic recombination can contribute to formation of deletions and duplications in the mitochondrial genomes—a frequent cause of mitochondrial defects during aging . Such a recombination could also explain several observations found in natural population ( Rand and Harrison , 1989; La Roche et al . , 1990; Lunt and Hyman , 1997; Ludwig et al . , 2000 ) . For instance , mtDNA of European rabbit ( Oryctolagus councils ) has repeated 153-bp motifs in the vicinity of the replication origin of H strand and very individual carries genomes with different numbers of these repeats ( Casane et al . , 1994 ) . In Drosophila , mtDNA varies in size from 16 to 20 kb ( Solignac et al . , 1986; Townsend and Rand , 2004; Rand , 2011 ) , mainly due to the variation in the length of the noncoding region , which contains two types of tandemly repeated elements ( Lewis et al . , 1994 ) . Rand has shown that spontaneous changes in length in populations as if repeats can come and go at a relatively rapid pace ( Rand , 2011 ) . While accurate repair using sibling molecules is likely to be the main purpose of mitochondrial recombination , more rare non-allelic events can have a major impact on the production of variants , and exchanges between distinctly marked genomes , as reported here , provide a means to characterize the process . Recombination is detected by and well known for its ability to promote genetic exchange . However , animal mtDNA is restricted in the types of exchange that can occur because uniparental inheritance prevents intermingling of genomes . The mitochondrial genome of each female is sheltered from encounters with foreign genomes and will be passed on in an isolated lineage or clone . Genetic exchange between distantly related genomes might occur as a result of occasional paternal transmission that introduces a foreign genome ( e . g . , Kraytsberg , 2004 ) , but the significance of such violations of uniparental inheritance are matters of an ongoing debate . For the most part , the integrity of mitochondrial haplotypes suggests that the contribution of exchange among distantly related genomes is relatively small ( Elson et al . , 2001 ) . The limitations on genetic exchange imposed by uniparental inheritance , which are similar to those in asexually propagating organisms , do not mean that there is no meaningful genetic exchange ( Hurst and Peck , 1996 ) . It has become increasingly apparent that organisms can carry more than one mitochondrial genotype , that is , they are naturally heteroplasmic because of new mutations , stably transmitting heteroplamic combinations , or a breakdown of uniparental inheritance ( Solignac et al . , 1983; Ladoukakis et al . , 2011; Tsang and Lemire , 2011; Payne et al . , 2012; Ma et al . , 2014; Ye et al . , 2014 ) . In this sense , the situation we created by introducing the temperature-sensitive genome into the ATP6[1] line , might be a model for things that can happen naturally . Emergence of a new genome with strong selfish drive , but with a defect in function , or introduction of such genome from another lineage will create a natural situation analogous to our experiment . The outcome of our experimental manipulation shows that this situation has generally detrimental consequences . Indeed , the temperature-sensitive mutation together with the drive advantage created a sort of ‘population time bomb’: the lineage remained healthy for multiple generations allowing the population to expand greatly , and then it collapsed upon elimination of the functional mt genome . Even rare recombination can uncouple a positively selected drive mutation from detrimental mutations , and as in our experiment , selection can then restore health . Thus , even occasional genetic exchange would prevent rogue genomes from wiping out lineages . In conclusion , we show that recombination among mitochondrial genomes occurs in Drosophila and that this recombination can be used to manipulate genomes for functional mapping . We suggest that recombination will influence evolution of the mitochondrial genome in animals and impact the genetic behavior of mitochondrial disease mutations . 4 Materials and methods Due to a long repetitive sequence in the AT-rich non-coding region of Drosophila mtDNA , PacBio SMRT was used to sequence the whole mitochondrial genome for three genotypes . SMRT sequencing can generate extraordinary long reads ( >30 , 000 bp ) with extremely high consensus accuracy ( >99 . 999% ) . Thus , the whole AT rich region could be covered in a single read without the trouble of re-assembly . Purified mtDNA ( isolated as described above ) was linearized by restriction cutting at the PstI site and a ∼20-kb band was isolated and gel purified after electrophoresis . About 500 ng of gel purified linear mtDNA sample was used for library preparation using a modified 10 kb Template Preparations Protocol ( PacBio , University of Washington , Seattle ) . Basically , the blunt hairpin SMRTBell adaptors were ligated to the repaired ends of the double-strand DNA fragments . Failed ligation products were removed by adding ExoIII and ExoVII exonucleases . The attached templates were further purified with 0 . 5× and 0 . 45× bead-washes for sequencing . We conducted the sequencing reactions on a PacBio RSII system using one SMRT cell for each genome . All libraries were sequenced using P4/C2 chemistry . mtDNA samples from mt:ND2del1 + mt:CoIT300I , and the recombinants were run with 120 min movie time and ATP6[1] sample was run with 180 min . Raw reads were analyzed following either HGAP ( for de novo assembly ) and BLASR protocol ( for resequencing ) in SMRT Portal 2 . 2 . The coverage for each samples ranged from 1000× to 35 , 000× . When only the coding region of some genomes were sequenced , two long-range PCR reactions using Expand Long Template PCR system ( Roche ) was performed: mt186–mt7502 , mt6905–mt14797 with the following program: 1 cycle of 93°C for 3 min , 30 cycles of 93°C 15 s , 50°C 30 s , 60°C 8 min , and 1 cycle of 60°C for 10 min . Primers were designed all around the coding region ( Supplementary file 2 ) for sequencing by QuintaraBio ( Albany , CA ) ."}
{"doi": "elife-01623-v1", "abstract": "Ras superfamily GTPase activation and inactivation occur by canonical nucleotide exchange and GTP hydrolysis mechanisms . Despite conservation of active-site residues , the Ras-related Rab GTPase activation pathway differs from Ras and between different Rabs . Analysis of DENND1-Rab35 , Rabex-Rab5 , TRAPP-Rab1 and DrrA-Rab1 suggests Rabs have the potential for activation by distinct GDP-release pathways . Conserved active-site residues in the Rab switch II region stabilising the nucleotide-free form differentiate these pathways . For DENND1-Rab35 and DrrA-Rab1 the Rab active-site glutamine , often mutated to create constitutively active forms , is involved in GEF mediated GDP-release . By contrast , in Rab5 the switch II aspartate is required for Rabex mediated GDP-release . Furthermore , Rab1 switch II glutamine mutants refractory to activation by DrrA can be activated by TRAPP , showing that a single Rab can be activated by more than one mechanistically distinct GDP-release pathway . These findings highlight plasticity in the activation mechanisms of closely related Rab GTPases .", "plain language summary": "The 70 or so members of the Rab subfamily of proteins perform a wide range of important tasks inside cells . A Rab protein is always bound to another molecule , which determines whether it is inactive or active . Binding to a molecule called GDP makes the Rab protein inactive , while binding to GTP makes it active . Proteins called guanine nucleotide exchange factors , or GEFs for short , activate the Rab protein by promoting the release of GDP and the binding of GTP . Other proteins—known as GAPs—lead to the inactivation of the Rab protein . Together these proteins form a molecular switch that can be turned on and off . The Rab subfamily of proteins is part of the large Ras superfamily , and all members of this superfamily are activated and inactivated in a similar way , with the binding and unbinding of GDP and GTP taking place at a structure called the G-domain . The fact that the detailed structure of this domain ( at the level of individual amino acids ) has been conserved over evolution is often taken as an indication that its mechanism has also been conserved . Langemeyer et al . have now tested this assumption with four different types of GEFs—three from humans and one from the bacteria that cause Listeria—and found that the story is more complicated than expected . The experiments showed that different amino acids in the active site of the Rab protein are involved when the GEFs mediate the release of the GDP during the activation process . For example , the amino acid glutamine is involved when the Listeria GEF and one of the human GEFs activate the protein , whereas a different amino acid—aspartate—is involved when one of the other human GEFs is responsible for the activation . Using this information , Langemeyer et al . create a human Rab protein that cannot be activated by the GEF from the bacteria that cause Listeria , but can still be activated by its normal human GEF . By showing that different Rab proteins are activated by different mechanisms , and that a single Rab protein can be activated by more than one mechanism , the work of Langemeyer et al . clearly illustrates the on-going ability of evolution to surprise researchers .", "article": "1 Introduction Rabs form an important and highly conserved subfamily of Ras-related GTPases that play essential roles in controlling membrane trafficking between the organelles of eukaryotic cells ( Zerial and McBride , 2001; Pfeffer and Aivazian , 2004 ) . Specific regulators controlling nucleotide exchange and hydrolysis promote kinetic proofreading of vesicle and target organelle membrane surfaces by Rab GTPases , and therefore permit accumulation of active Rabs only at the required sites ( Barr and Lambright , 2010; Barr , 2013 ) . The mechanistic details of how such regulators control Rab activation is therefore important for understanding the regulation of membrane identity and vesicle transport . Activation of Ras superfamily GTPases is thought to proceed by a general nucleotide exchange mechanism ( Bos et al . , 2007 ) . In the Ras-SOS GEF ( guanine nucleotide exchange factor ) complex the Ras P-loop lysine interacts with a conserved glutamate intrinsic to the Ras active site switch II region , thereby stabilising the GEF bound nucleotide-free form of the GTPase ( Boriack-Sjodin et al . , 1998 ) . Mutation of this glutamate therefore reduces GEF-stimulated GDP-release , and compromises Ras activation ( Gasper et al . , 2008 ) . Because of the high degree of sequence conservation in the Ras superfamily and Rab subfamily ( Klopper et al . , 2012; Rojas et al . , 2012 ) , this mechanism might be expected to be the same in the Rab subfamily of GTPases . However , at odds with this simple idea mutation of the conserved Rab switch II glutamate residue to alanine has little effect on the rate of GEF-mediated nucleotide exchange ( Gasper et al . , 2008 ) . In addition to these potential differences between Ras and Rab activation , the mechanism of Rab inactivation by GTPase activating proteins ( GAPs ) diverges in key details from Ras . In Ras the conserved switch II glutamine 61 and an arginine residue contributed into the Ras active site by the GAP act together to promote GTP hydrolysis ( Ahmadian et al . , 1997; Scheffzek et al . , 1997 ) . Mutation of either residue therefore prevents GTP hydrolysis . This has great biological relevance since the Ras switch II glutamine is frequently mutated in cancers creating a constitutively active oncogenic form of the protein . In Rabs , although the switch II glutamine is conserved , crystal structures of Rab33 and Rab1 with TBC domain Rab GAPs , Gyp1p and TBC1D20 , respectively , reveal that it does not play a direct role in GTP hydrolysis ( Pan et al . , 2006; Gavriljuk et al . , 2012 ) . Instead , the GAP contributes both arginine and glutamine residues important for catalysis to the Rab activate site ( Pan et al . , 2006; Gavriljuk et al . , 2012 ) . Therefore , despite the high level of sequence conservation in the key switch regions of Ras and Rab family members , the mechanisms of activation and inactivation may differ between Ras and Rabs . In other words shared sequence cannot be assumed to imply shared mechanism . We therefore investigated the role of conserved Rab switch II active site residues in GEF-mediated activation to obtain insight into the function and reasons for their conservation . This analysis revealed that Rab activation diverges from the canonical Ras pathway in key details . Furthermore , we find that even within the Rab family different activation mechanisms are used by different Rabs . 2 Results Inspection of the Ras-SOS GEF complex shows that the Ras P-loop lysine interacts with a conserved glutamate intrinsic to the active site switch II region ( Figure 1A ) . Scrutiny of DENND1-Rab35 ( Wu et al . , 2011 ) and Rab1-DrrA ( Schoebel et al . , 2009; Suh et al . , 2010 ) Rab-GEF complex crystal structures suggests divergence from the Ras activation pathway . In both DENND1 and DrrA complexes , the Rab P-loop lysine 21 interacts with the switch II glutamine 67 and aspartate 63 of the target GTPase ( Figure 1B , C ) . Examination of other Rab GEF complexes provides further support for the view that Rab activation differs from Ras . In the case of Rab1 bound to TRAPP there is no interaction of the Rab P-loop lysine with switch II residues ( Figure 1D ) . Instead , a glutamate at position 192 is contributed to the Rab active site by the C-terminal extension of the TRAPP Bet3 subunit ( Cai et al . , 2008; Chin et al . , 2009; Figure 1D ) . This could be considered mimicry of the Rab switch II region glutamate by the GEF . For the Rab5 family GTPase Rab21 in complex with the Vps9 domain of the Rabex exchange factor , a conserved aspartate 74 in the switch II region of the Rab interacts with the P-loop lysine 32 ( Delprato et al . , 2004; Delprato and Lambright , 2007; Figure 1E ) . Analogous to TRAPP an acidic residue is also contributed by Rabex , in this case an aspartate at position 313 ( Figure 1E ) . These different modes of Rab P-loop interaction with the switch II region or residues from the GEF suggest distinct GDP-release pathways exist for Rab GTPases . 10 . 7554/eLife . 01623 . 003Figure 1 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 01623 . 003 To test this idea a series of GEFs acting on Rab GTPases were analysed . First , the Rab35 GEF DENND1 was compared to the Rab1 GEF DrrA . Rab35 switch II glutamine 67 mutation to alanine ( Q67A ) greatly reduced DENND1-stimulated nucleotide exchange towards Rab35 ( Figure 2A ) . Catalytic efficiency ( kcat/Km ) was reduced from 2 . 3 × 104 M−1s−1 similar to previous measurements using wild type Rab35 ( Wu et al . , 2011 ) to ∼7 . 5 × 102 M−1s−1 for the Q67A mutant . Importantly , the glutamine to alanine mutation had little effect on basal GEF-independent nucleotide exchange . In the case of Rab35 there is a specific requirement for glutamine at this position since alteration of the switch II glutamine to glutamate resulted in a form of Rab35 Q67E that was not activated by DENND1 ( Figure 2A ) . In addition , mutation of the switch II glutamate 68 ( E68A ) required for nucleotide exchange in the canonical Ras activation pathway had little effect on DENND1-stimulated nucleotide exchange by Rab35 ( Figure 2A ) . Similarly , the Q67A switch II mutation greatly reduced DrrA-mediated nucleotide exchange towards Rab1 from a kcat/Km of 6 . 0 × 104 to 5 . 3 × 103 M−1s−1 ( Figure 2B ) . Mutation of the switch II glutamate ( E68A ) in Rab1 had little effect on DrrA-mediated nucleotide exchange , kcat/Km 6 . 0 × 104 M−1s−1 ( Figure 2B ) . Removal of the switch II aspartate 63 contacting the P-loop lysine residue resulted in increased basal release for both Rab35 and Rab1 ( Figure 2A , B ) , consistent with its role in nucleotide binding . For DENND1 this substitution resulted in a small reduction in kcat/Km to 1 . 7 × 104 M−1s−1 ( Figure 2A ) , while for DrrA kcat/Km increased over threefold to 2 × 105 M−1s−1 ( Figure 2B ) . These results suggest that the switch II glutamine in these Rabs plays a crucial and previously unsuspected role in GDP-release during Rab activation . By contrast , the switch II aspartate contributes to nucleotide binding and therefore limits GDP-release ( Pai et al . , 1989; John et al . , 1993 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 01623 . 004Figure 2 . Distinct roles for switch II residues in GEF-mediated nucleotide exchange independent of the basal nucleotide release pathway . ( A ) Initial rates of nucleotide exchange as a function of GEF concentration are plotted for Rab35-DENND1 , ( B ) Rab1-DrrA , ( C ) Rab5-Rabex and ( D ) Rab1-TRAPP . Wild type and mutant Rabs were used as indicated; curves are colour coded as in Figure 1 according to the position in the switch II region predicted to be important for GEF-mediated nucleotide release . Wild type full-length GEFs were used for DENND1 , DrrA , Rabex and TRAPP , as well as the Rabex D313A mutant , and the TRAPP Bet3 E192A/D193A mutant . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 01623 . 004 The structure of the Rab5 family member Rab21 with its Vps9 domain GEF Rabex suggested that in this case the conserved glutamine is not in a position to promote nucleotide exchange ( Figure 1E ) . Instead , the structure suggests an alternative pathway where the Rab P-loop lysine interacts with the Rab switch II aspartate and an aspartate finger residue D313 in Rabex . As reported previously , mutation of the Rabex aspartate to alanine D313A abolished the activity of the GEF ( Figure 2C; Delprato et al . , 2004 ) . In support of the role of the Rab switch II aspartate in this alternative exchange pathway , mutation of the Rab5 conserved aspartate D76A greatly reduced Rabex-mediated nucleotide exchange ( Figure 2C ) . Because the numbering of Rab5c is increased by two amino acids with respect to the Rab21 , the same residue is D74 in the Rab21 structure ( Figure 1E ) . Catalytic efficiency was reduced from 2 . 5×104 M−1s−1 in agreement with previous measurements using wild type Rab5 ( Delprato et al . , 2004; Delprato and Lambright , 2007 ) to ∼2 . 5 × 102 M−1s−1 for the D76A mutant . As expected from the crystal structure of the Rab21-Rabex complex ( Figure 1E ) , the Q80A mutation ( Q78 in Figure 1E ) had little effect on the activity of Rabex towards Rab5 ( Figure 2C ) . Interestingly , mutation of Rab5 switch II glutamate 81 ( Rab21 E79 in Figure 1E ) resulted in an increase in the rate of Rabex-stimulated GDP-release from a kcat/Km of 2 . 5 × 104 to 4 . 6 × 104 M−1s−1 ( Figure 2C ) . This increase is possibly due to removal of the negative charge on the switch II favouring entry of Rabex aspartate 313 into the vicinity of the P-loop lysine . Rab5 activation by Rabex therefore proceeds via an alternative pathway in which the conserved switch II aspartate interacts with the P-loop lysine to promote GDP-release . This is different to Rab35-DENND1 or Ras-SOS where the switch II glutamine or glutamate fulfil an equivalent role . Both TRAPP and DrrA can activate Rab1 family GTPases , however the crystal structures of these Rab-GEF complexes reveal differences in the interaction network around the P-loop lysine . For Rab1-DrrA complexes , the Rab1 P-loop lysine contacts the switch II aspartate 63 and glutamine 67 residues ( Figure 1C ) . This is different to the structure of Rab1 with its longin domain GEF TRAPP where there are no obvious contacts between switch II and the P-loop lysine 21 ( Figure 1D ) . Instead , the structure suggests an alternative pathway where the Rab1 P-loop lysine interacts with an acidic glutamate finger residue E192 provided by the Bet3 subunit of the TRAPP GEF complex . The Rab1 switch II glutamine mutation is therefore predicted to have no effect on TRAPP mediated nucleotide exchange . In agreement with this idea , the switch II glutamine mutation Q67A that greatly reduced DrrA-mediated nucleotide exchange towards Rab1 ( Figure 2B ) had little effect on the activity of budding yeast TRAPP towards Rab1/Ypt1 ( Figure 2D ) . As for DrrA , removal of the Rab1 switch II aspartate 63 contacting the P-loop lysine residue resulted in increased basal and TRAPP-stimulated GDP-release ( Figure 2D ) . Interestingly , mutation of switch II glutamate 68 increased the rate of TRAPP-stimulated GDP-release over 10-fold from a kcat/Km of 1 . 3 × 105 M−1s−1 . This was possibly due to removal of the negative charge on the switch II favouring entry of Bet3 glutamate 192 into the vicinity of the P-loop lysine . To confirm the requirement for the Bet3 acidic C-terminal region , TRAPP complexes containing a Bet3 E192A/D193A mutant were produced . These showed a fourfold reduction in GEF activity towards Rab1 ( Figure 2C ) . This is similar to the result obtained with Rabex , which also inserts an acidic residue to coordinate the P-loop lysine during GDP-release . Rab1 activation by TRAPP therefore proceeds via a pathway in which the P-loop lysine does not interact with switch II , but is stabilised by an acidic residue from the GEF thereby promoting GDP-release . Together , these results define previously unrecognised pathways for activation of a Ras superfamily GTPase that are discrete from the switch II glutamate dependent pathway followed by Ras . Notably , the results obtained with Rab1 also reveal that a single Ras superfamily GTPase has the potential to follow more than one activation pathway depending on the GEF it is coupling with . Since the switch II glutamine appears to be an important element in the activation pathway of Rab proteins by GEFs , we also wanted to analyse the significance of its involvement in GAP-mediated Rab-inactivation . Therefore , the role of the switch II glutamine in the GTP hydrolysis reaction leading to Rab inactivation was examined . Crystal structures of Rab33 and Rab1 with TBC domain Rab GAPs , Gyp1p and TBC1D20 , respectively , show that the GAP rather than the cognate GTPase contributes the glutamine residue important for nucleotide hydrolysis ( Pan et al . , 2006; Gavriljuk et al . , 2012 ) . In these cases the only contribution of the switch II glutamine appears to be in contacting the peptide backbone of the GAP . Therefore it may stabilise the Rab-GAP complex rather than playing a direct role in catalysis . The TBC domain Rab GAPs acting on Rab35 , Rab5 and Rab1 were then analysed ( Haas et al . , 2005 , 2007; Fuchs et al . , 2007 ) . Switch II glutamine mutation of Rab35 and Rab1 greatly reduced GTP hydrolysis stimulated by TBC1D10A and TBC1D20 , respectively , but had less than ∼1 . 5-fold effect on basal GTP hydrolysis ( Figure 3A , B ) . By contrast , the switch II glutamine mutation had no effect on the activity of RUTBC3 towards Rab5 , but caused a greater than fivefold reduction in basal GTP hydrolysis ( Figure 3C ) . Consequently , depending on the Rab , the switch II glutamine is important for Rab inactivation by GAP-stimulated or basal hydrolysis reactions . 10 . 7554/eLife . 01623 . 005Figure 3 . Differential requirements for the Rab switch II glutamine in GAP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis . ( A ) Rab GTP hydrolysis as a function of GAP concentration are plotted for Rab35-TBC1D10 , ( B ) , and Rab1-TBC1D20 ( C ) Rab5-RUTBC3 . Both wild type and switch II glutamine mutant Rabs were used . Basal GTP hydrolysis of purified Rabs in the absence of the cognate GAP is shown in the bar graph insets ( mean +/− the deviation from the mean , n = 2 ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 01623 . 005 Rab switch II glutamine mutants have been widely used as dominant active forms . This is best understood for Rab5 where such mutants promote endosome fusion ( Stenmark et al . , 1994; Rybin et al . , 1996 ) . The results presented here indicate that this may not apply to other Rabs , since the same mutation can interfere with GEF stimulated GDP-release and hence Rab activation . This suggests that in some Rabs switch II glutamine mutations will be uncoupled from their GEF and hence inactive rather than dominant active when expressed in cells . This idea was tested using Rab35 and the plasma membrane to Golgi trafficking pathway with Shiga toxin B as cargo protein . These experiments confirmed that wild type Rab35 supported delivery of cargo to the Golgi ( Figure 4A , 90 min timepoint ) , as previously reported ( Fuchs et al . , 2007; Yoshimura et al . , 2010 ) . Under the same conditions the switch II mutant Rab35Q67A did not actively interfere with Shiga toxin transport ( Figure 4A , 90 min timepoint ) . This indicates it does not act as a dominant negative inhibitor of transport . However , in the absence of the endogenous protein , Rab35Q67A failed to support efficient Shiga toxin transport to the Golgi ( Figure 4B ) . Instead , Shiga toxin accumulated in small punctate structures and was not efficiently delivered to the Golgi even after 90 min ( Figure 4B ) . This reduced accumulation in the Golgi was not due to altered binding of Shiga toxin to the cell surface , since this was equivalent in all the conditions used ( Figure 4A , B , 0 min timepoint ) . Quantitation showed transport efficiency was over 80% for wild type Rab35 , whereas Rab35Q67A did not rescue transport above the level seen in the absence of Rab35 ( Figure 4C ) . Therefore Rab35 switch II glutamine mutants are inactive rather than dominant active . 10 . 7554/eLife . 01623 . 006Figure 4 . The glutamine switch II mutant Rab35 fails to support Shiga toxin transport from the cell surface to the Golgi . ( A ) Shiga toxin B ( STxB ) uptake assays were performed for 0 and 90 min in HeLa cells expressing either Rab35 , or ( B ) the Rab35Q67A mutant . Endogenous Rab35 was depleted using siRNA directed to the 3′-UTR or a mock depletion performed using a non-targeting control duplex . Cells were stained with a GM130 antibody to mark the Golgi . Scale bar is 10 µm . Cells outlined in yellow dotted lines in the 90 min timepoint express GFP-Rab35 or Rab35Q67A , and asterisks mark non-transfected cells . Arrowheads mark those cells shown in the enlarged panels to the right . ( C ) Delivery of Shiga toxin into the Golgi was scored and is plotted in the bar graph ( mean +/− deviation from the mean , n = 2 ) . ( D ) FRAP experiments were performed on cells expressing wild type and Switch II glutamine mutant Rab35 or ( E ) Rab5 ( mean +/− standard deviation from the mean , n = 12 ) . Western blots show the distribution of GFP-Rab35 or GFP-Rab5 in the membrane and cytosol fractions marked by the Golgi membrane protein GM130 and tubulin , respectively . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 01623 . 006 To test if this loss of function is associated with reduced membrane recruitment , the rate of wild type Rab35 and Q67 switch II mutant recruitment to organelle membranes was investigated using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) . In agreement with the GEF activity data , Rab35 was rapidly recruited to membranes while the Rab35 Q67A or Q67L mutants showed only slow recovery ( Figure 4D ) . For Rab5 the Q80A/L switch II mutation ( Q78 in Rab21 , Figure 1E ) did not alter activation by the GEF Rabex ( Figure 2C ) , and accordingly had no effect on the rate of recovery ( Figure 4E ) , suggesting it is rapidly recruited to membranes like wild type Rab5 . Western blot analysis confirmed that at steady state the membrane bound fractions of wild type and switch II glutamine mutant Rab35 and Rab5 were unaltered ( Figure 4D , E , inset blots ) . This suggests that membrane anchoring of the Rabs was not affected by the mutations . Together , these results show that switch II glutamine mutant Rab35Q67A is defective for rapid membrane recruitment , and fails to support Shiga toxin trafficking to the Golgi . 3 Discussion The structural and biochemical analysis presented in this study identifies distinct pathways for Rab activation used by different RabGEF families . These can be divided into two main groups depending on the role played by the switch II region . For the first class of Rab GEFs , exemplified by DrrA and the DENN family member DENND1 , GDP-release is promoted by interaction of the P-loop lysine with the conserved glutamine residue intrinsic to switch II ( Figure 5A ) . Some details of this mechanism remain unresolved , particularly the question of how charge neutralization of the Rab P-loop lysine occurs remains unclear . The Rab–RabGEF complex structures suggest this is possibly due to the negatively charged switch II aspartate , however mutation of this residue does not reduce GEF mediated GDP-release . Future work , analysing structures of such mutants will therefore be necessary . For the second class of GEFs represented by the Vps9 family member Rabex and TRAPP , the Rab P-loop lysine interacts with a negatively charged residue , either aspartate or glutamate , provided by the GEF and extrinsic to the Rab ( Figure 5A ) . This latter group can be further subdivided , since stabilisation of the P-loop lysine in Rab1 bound to TRAPP appears not to involve direct interaction with any residues in switch II . All these cases are different to the general nucleotide exchange mechanism proposed for the Ras family , in which formation of the nucleotide-free form of the GTPase is promoted by interaction of a glutamate intrinsic to the switch II region with the P-loop lysine ( Boriack-Sjodin et al . , 1998; Bos et al . , 2007; Gasper et al . , 2008 ) . For Ras , this results in discrete requirements for conserved glutamate and glutamine residues in switch II for GEF-mediated activation and GAP-stimulated inactivation , respectively . However , for DENND1 and DrrA , the switch II glutamine of the target Rabs interacts with the P-loop lysine to promote conversion of the Rab GDP form to a nucleotide-free intermediate that then binds GTP ( Figure 5B ) . Mutation of this glutamine therefore reduces the rate of GDP release by the Rab . In addition , the same glutamine interacts with the GAP and aides the GTP hydrolysis reaction converting the GTP to a GDP bound Rab ( Figure 5B ) , thereby inactivating the Rab . This results in activation and inactivation processes with a shared requirement for the switch II glutamine residue . The glutamine side chain swings from an ‘in’ conformation where it contacts the P-loop lysine during nucleotide exchange ( activation ) , to an ‘out’ conformation where it contacts the GAP during GTP hydrolysis ( Figure 5C ) . DENND1 , the Rab35 GEF studied here , is a member of the DENN and DENN-related proteins that form the largest family of Rab nucleotide exchange factors ( Yoshimura et al . , 2010; Barr , 2013 ) . Therefore , these findings are likely to be broadly applicable to many other Rab GTPases . As a consequence they have wide significance for future studies of membrane trafficking and GTPase regulation in other systems . 10 . 7554/eLife . 01623 . 007Figure 5 . Diversity and plasticity in Rab GTPase nucleotide release mechanism . ( A ) A schematic depicting the three different P-loop lysine interactions with the Rab switch II region and GEF , or Ras and the GEF SOS . Circled residues are required for GEF-mediated GDP release . ( B ) The switch II glutamine is required for both Rab GAP stimulated GTP hydrolysis , and DrrA or DENN GEF mediated nucleotide exchange reactions . GEF interaction with the GTPase results in distortion of switch I and II regions , and reduced affinity for both the guanosine and terminal phosphate of bound GDP . The switch II glutamine interacts with the P-loop lysine to displace the β-phosphate . This does not occur for switch II Q-mutant Rabs and GDP-release therefore fails . Adapted from Figure 5 of Thomas and Wittinghofer 2007 ( Thomas et al . , 2007 ) . ( C ) A revised Rab GTPase cycle in which GEF-stimulated activation and GAP-mediated inactivation share a common determinant with respect to switch II . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 01623 . 007 The findings presented here also indicate that switch II glutamine mutant Rabs will behave differently depending on the nature of their GEF activator and GAP inactivator . For DENN GEF targets such as Rab35 , because both GEF-stimulated activation and GAP-mediated inactivation are compromised ( Figures 2A and 3A ) , the Rab does not fulfil its cellular purpose ( Figure 4A–C ) . For Rab1/Ypt1 activated by TRAPP , switch II mutants slow but do not prevent the GAP-stimulated GTPase reaction ( Figure 3B ) , possibly explaining the subcritical reduction in transport efficiency reported previously ( De Antoni et al . , 2002 ) . In the case of Rab5 , switch II glutamine Q79A mutation prolongs the lifetime of the active state by reducing the intrinsic or spontaneous rate of GTP hydrolysis ( Figure 3C ) , and as a result promotes endosome fusion ( Stenmark et al . , 1994; Rybin et al . , 1996 ) . Rab5 has served a paradigm for the function of Rab GTPases in membrane traffic ( Zerial and McBride , 2001 ) , yet as shown here switch II glutamine mutations in other Rabs may not behave in the same fashion as they do in Rab5 . For Rab5 the switch II glutamine mutation results in a form that displays near wild type properties in terms of GAP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis , yet strongly compromised basal GTP hydrolysis . Results obtained previously for Rab33B and its GAP RUTBC1 ( Nottingham et al . , 2011 ) show this is true for at least one other Rab . However , for Rab1 and Rab35 tested here the same mutation greatly reduces GAP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis . These results have implications for the interpretation of published work on Rab5 regulation . While removal of the Rab5 GAP RUTBC3 results in moderately enlarged endosomes and a delay in endocytic trafficking , expression of Rab5 glutamine mutants causes formation of grossly enlarged vacuolar early endosomes and blocks the pathway at this stage ( Stenmark et al . , 1994; Haas et al . , 2005 ) . Together these findings indicate that in cells basal hydrolysis is an important determinant of Rab5 lifetime and turnover . This agrees with the idea that the major regulatory determinants of Rab5 levels at endosomal membranes are inputs driving GEF activity such as ubiquitylated cargo and PI-lipids rather than GAP activity ( Del Conte-Zerial et al . , 2008; Barr , 2013 ) . By contrast , GAP-stimulated Rab5 turnover may occur in response to specific signals during cell migration and cell adhesion ( Palamidessi et al . , 2013 ) . Switch II glutamine mutants have typically been used to trap Rab GTPases in the active state . As shown here this may generate a GTPase refractory to GEF-mediated activation and GAP-stimulated inactivation . The results reported here therefore have implications for the interpretation of many prior studies of Rab GTPase function that have relied on the use of switch II point mutants for individual Rabs or as part of libraries or Rab toolkits ( Ullrich et al . , 1996; Richardson et al . , 1998; Clark et al . , 2011; Dambournet et al . , 2011; Gallegos et al . , 2012; Ishida et al . , 2012; Xiong et al . , 2012 ) . Depending on the nature of the GEF for the GTPase in question , then , the mutation may have additional consequences for GEF stimulated nucleotide exchange . Where this is not known the results of such experiments must be treated with great caution . In analysing the role of switch II residues , this work has uncovered plasticity in terms of the different pathways leading to Rab activation . Although all Rabs switch between common GDP and GTP bound states , the intermediates of the nucleotide exchange reaction differ in crucial features . In some cases a single Rab , shown here for Rab1 , can follow a different activation pathway depending on the nature of its cognate GEF . Importantly , switch II mutations that compromise one pathway do not necessarily affect other activation routes . Thus , Rab1 switch II glutamine mutants can be activated by TRAPP , yet are refractory to activation by DrrA . These findings raise the possibility that small molecule inhibitors could be developed to target these mechanistically discrete pathways and associated switch II conformations . 4 Materials and methods General laboratory chemicals were obtained from Sigma–Aldrich , UK and Fisher Scientific , UK . Commercially available antibodies were used to GM130 ( mouse clone 35; BD Biosciences , UK ) . Secondary antibodies raised in donkey to mouse , rabbit , sheep/goat , and human conjugated to HRP , Alexa-488 , Alexa-555 , Alexa-568 , and Alexa-647 were obtained from Molecular Probes/Life Technologies , UK and Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc , West Grove , PA . The libraries of hexahistidine-GST in pFAT2 and eGFP-tagged Rab GTPases and human GEF coding sequences have been described previously ( Yoshimura et al . , 2010 ) . Mutagenesis was performed using the Quickchange method according to the protocol ( Agilent Technologies , UK ) . Rab proteins in pFAT2 were expressed in BL21 ( DE3 ) pRIL at 18°C for 12–14 hr , then purified using Ni-NTA agarose as described previously ( Fuchs et al . , 2007 ) . In brief , cell pellets were lysed in 20 ml IMAC20 ( 20 mM Tris–HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 300 mM NaCl , 20 mM imidazole , and protease inhibitor cocktail; Roche Diagnostics , UK ) using an Emulsiflex C-5 system ( AVESTIN , Germany ) . Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 16 , 000×g rpm in a JA-17 rotor for 30 min . To purify the tagged protein , 0 . 5 ml of nickel-charged NTA-agarose ( QIAGEN , UK ) was added to the clarified lysate and rotated for 2 hr . The agarose was washed three times with IMAC20 and the bound proteins eluted in IMAC200 ( IMAC20 with 200 mM imidazole ) collecting 1 . 5 ml fractions . All manipulations were performed on ice or in an 8°C cold room . Hexahistidine-tagged Rabex5 , DENND1B-S , in pQE32 were expressed in JM109 at 18°C for 12–14 hr , then purified using nickel-charged NTA agarose using the same procedure as the Rabs . RabGAPs RUTBC3 , TBC1D10A and TBC1D20 were purified as described previously ( Fuchs et al . , 2007 ) . Purified proteins were dialyzed against TBS ( 50 mM Tris–HCl , pH 7 . 4 , and 150 mM NaCl ) and then snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage at −80°C . Protein concentration was measured using the Bradford assay . TRAPPI-complex and DrrA were purified as described elsewhere ( Cai et al . , 2008; Schoebel et al . , 2009 ) . First 10 nmol of hexahistidine-GST-Rab was loaded with 2′- ( 3′ ) -bis-O- ( N-methylanthraniloyl ) -GDP ( Mant-GDP ) ( Jena Bioscience , Germany ) in 20 mM HEPES , pH 6 . 8 , 1 mg/ml BSA , 20 mM EDTA , pH 8 . 0 , 40 mM Mant-GDP at 30°C for 30 min . After loading 25 mmol MgCl2 was added and the sample was exchanged into reaction buffer ( 20 mM HEPES , pH 6 . 8 , 1 mg/ml BSA , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM MgCl2 ) using Zeba spin columns ( Fisher Scientific ) . This step removes the free Mant-GDP leaving only Rab bound nucleotide . Nucleotide exchange was then measured using 1 nmol of the loaded Rab and the amount of GEF specified in the figure legends in a final volume of 100 µl reaction buffer by monitoring the quenching of fluorescence after release of Mant-GDP using a Tristar LB 941 plate reader ( Berthold Technologies , UK ) under control of MikroWin Software . Samples were excited at 350 nm and emission monitored at 440 nm . GTP was added to a final concentration of 0 . 1 mM to start the exchange reaction at 30°C . Curve fitting and extraction of pseudo first order rate constants ( kobs ) was carried out as described previously ( Delprato et al . , 2004; Delprato and Lambright , 2007 ) . Since kobs = ( kcat/Km ) [GEF] + kbasal where kbasal is the rate constant measured in the absence of GEF , catalytic efficiency ( kcat/Km ) can be obtained . For GTP-loading reactions , 10 µl assay buffer ( 20 mM HEPES , pH 6 . 8 , 1 mg/ml BSA ) , 73 µl H2O , 10 µl of 10 mM EDTA , pH 8 . 0 , 5 µl of 1 mM GTP , 2 µl γ-[32P]-GTP ( 6000 Ci/mmol 10 mCi/ml Perkin Elmer , UK ) , and 100 pmol Rab-GTPase were mixed on ice . After 30 min of incubation at 30°C , loaded GTPases were stored on ice . GAP reactions were started by the addition of GAP to 1 µM Rab in 50 µl final volume as specified in the figures . A 2 . 5 μl aliquot of the assay mix was scintillation counted to measure the specific activity in counts per minute per picomole of GTP . Reactions were then incubated at 30°C for 0 to 60 min and then split into two equal aliquots . 5 µl of each aliquot was immediately added to 795 µl of ice-cold 5% ( wt/vol ) activated charcoal slurry in 50 mM NaH2PO4 , left for 1 hr on ice , and centrifuged at 20 , 000×g to pellet the charcoal . A 400 µl aliquot of the supernatant was scintillation counted , and the amount of GTP hydrolyzed was calculated from the specific activity of the reaction mixture . HeLa cells were cultured on No . 1 . 5 glass coverslips ( Menzel-Gläser , Fisher Scientific ) in DMEM containing 10% bovine calf serum ( Invitrogen ) at 37°C and 5% CO2 . Endogenous Rab35 was depleted using siRNA duplexes obtained from Qiagen directed against the 3′-UTR ( Hs_RAB35_4 SI00092638 ) , target sequence 5′-CCTGGGAAGAACCGAGTTTAA-3′ transfected using Oligofectamine ( Life Technologies ) for 72 hr . Cells were then transfected with eGFP-Rab35 or Rab35Q67A for 18 hr using Mirus LT1 ( Mirus Bio LLC , Madison , WI ) . Shiga toxin assays were then carried out as described previously ( Fuchs et al . , 2007 ) . For imaging samples were washed twice with 2 ml of PBS , and fixed with 2 ml of 3% ( wt/vol ) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min . Fixative was removed and the cells quenched with 2 ml of 50 mM NH4Cl in PBS for 10 min . Coverslips were washed three times in 2 ml PBS before permeabilization in 0 . 2% ( vol/vol ) Triton-X 100 for 5 min . Cells were then stained with GM130 antibodies . Primary and secondary antibody staining was carried out in PBS for 60 min at room temperature . Coverslips were mounted in Mowiol 4-88 mounting medium ( Merck Millipore , UK ) . Fixed samples on glass slides were imaged using a 60x NA1 . 35 oil immersion objective on an Olympus BX61 upright microscope with filter sets for DAPI , GFP/Alexa-488 , Alexa-555 , Alexa-568 , and Alexa-647 ( Chroma Technology Corp . , Bellows Falls , VT ) , a CoolSNAP HQ2 camera ( Roper Scientific ) , and Metamorph 7 . 5 imaging software ( Molecular Dynamics Inc . , Sunnyvale , CA ) . For live cell imaging using spinning disk confocal microscopy , cells were plated in 35 mm dishes with a 14 mm No . 1 . 5 thickness coverglass window in the bottom ( MatTek Corporation , Ashland , MA ) . Cells were left for 24 hr then transfected with eGFP-Rab constructs for a further 16 hr . For imaging , the dishes were placed in a 37°C and 5% CO2 environment chamber ( Tokai Hit CO . , Ltd , Japan ) on the microscope stage . Imaging was performed at 37°C in 5% CO2 using an Olympus IX81 inverted microscope with a 60x 1 . 42NA oil immersion objective coupled to an Ultraview Vox spinning disk confocal system ( Perkin Elmer ) fitted with a C9100-13 EM-CCD camera ( Hamamatsu Photonics Limited , UK ) . For FRAP , five image stacks of four planes with 0 . 2 μm spacing were acquired at 1 s intervals during the pre-bleach period . Bleach of the eGFP-Rab signal was performed using an UltraVIEW PK Device with the 488 nm laser set at 10% with the following settings: cycles 5 , step size 1 , spot period 10 , stop period 10 , spot cycles 1 , small spot size and no attenuation . Recovery images were acquired for 30 time points every 2 s using 50 ms exposures at 4% laser power and then a further 30 time points every 4 s . Quantification and analysis of the FRAP data were performed using ImageJ . For membrane fractionation the cells were washed from the dish in PBS containing 1 mM EDTA , then homogenized using 20 passes through an 18-gauge needle in 50 mM HEPES-NaOH pH7 . 4 , 200 mM sucrose . Unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 1000×g for 10 min in a microfuge . A membrane pellet and cytosol were prepared from this post-nuclear supernatant by centrifugation at 100 , 000×g for 60 min in a TLA-100 rotor . Equivalent proportions of the membrane pellet and cytosol were analysed by western blotting ."}

Transmissions resulting in disease decreased markedly over time .", "plain language summary": "Tuberculosis is an important public health threat around the globe and is particularly common in developing countries . It is difficult to control the spread of the disease because the bacteria that cause it can spread when an infected individual coughs or sneezes . It may take years for an infected individual to develop symptoms of tuberculosis so it can be hard to trace the source of an outbreak , and people infected with HIV are particularly susceptible to the disease . The bacterium that causes the majority of cases of tuberculosis is called Mycobacterium tuberculosis . There are several different varieties or ‘lineages’ of M . tuberculosis , and it is thought that they may vary in their ability to spread and cause disease . However , the results of previous studies have been inconsistent and there also seems to be a lot of variation between strains within the same lineage . In this study , Guerra-Assunção et al . used an approach called whole genome sequencing alongside more traditional methods to study the spread of tuberculosis in Malawi . They sequenced the genomes of every available sample of M . tuberculosis collected from patients in the Karonga district of Malawi over a 15-year period . This produced high-quality DNA sequence data about the bacteria responsible for almost 1700 cases of disease . Using this massive amount of data , Guerra-Assunção et al . constructed networks that showed how the bacteria had spread in the community . This revealed that there were differences between the ability of the various M . tuberculosis lineages to cause disease and to spread in communities . For example , lineage 1 was less likely than the other lineages to cause disease soon after infecting an individual and was less able to spread . The data also show that the proportion of cases of disease due to recent infection declined substantially during the 15-year period . This indicates that the tuberculosis and HIV control programmes in the area have been successful . Guerra-Assunção et al . 's findings show that it is possible to understand how tuberculosis is transmitted on a large scale . The next challenge is to understand why the lineages differ in their ability to cause disease and spread between individuals .", "article": "1 Introduction Despite the huge global burden of tuberculosis , the factors influencing transmission remain poorly understood . Compared to other bacteria , the genome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is stable and genetic variation was thought to be limited , but with increased sequencing , greater diversity has been recognized ( Homolka et al . , 2010 ) . Based on the genotype , M . tuberculosis has seven lineages: three ‘ancient’ ( lineage-1 and two Mycobacterium africanum lineages ) , and three ‘modern’ ( lineages-2 , 3 , 4 ) ( Comas et al . , 2009 ) , and one intermediate ( lineage-7 ) , recently described in Ethiopia ( Firdessa et al . , 2013 ) . The lineages may vary in propensity to transmit and cause disease ( Thwaites et al . , 2008; Homolka et al . , 2010; Parwati et al . , 2010; Gagneux , 2012 ) , but results are inconsistent and there is considerable strain-to-strain variation within lineages ( Portevin et al . , 2011; Mathema et al . , 2012 ) . Lineage-2 ( Beijing ) strains are associated with increasing spread and drug resistance in some areas but not others ( European Concerted Action on New Generation Genetic Markers , 2006 ) , and with a lower ( Click et al . , 2012 ) or higher ( Kong et al . , 2007 ) proportion of extrapulmonary tuberculosis . M . africanum has been associated with lower virulence ( de Jong et al . , 2008 ) , and lineage-1 with faster sputum smear conversion ( Click et al . , 2013 ) . In low incidence settings , lineage is often associated with immigrant sub-groups , and while host–pathogen co-evolution has been suggested , it is difficult to disentangle the effects of lineage and host susceptibility on pathogenesis ( Reed et al . , 2009; Gagneux , 2012; Pareek et al . , 2013 ) . Since the 1990s , methods such as RFLP based on the insertion element IS6110 ( van Embden et al . , 1993 ) have been used to distinguish clusters of patients with shared DNA-fingerprint patterns , suggesting recent transmission ( Small et al . , 1994 ) , but within the clusters , these methods cannot distinguish who transmitted to whom . Whole genome sequencing provides far greater resolution , and if data are collected in a whole population over several years , single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) can be used to construct transmission networks ( Bryant et al . , 2013; Walker et al . , 2013 , 2014 ) . In low-incidence settings small numbers of SNPs have been found between epidemiologically linked patients ( Kato-Maeda et al . , 2013 ) , although the maximum SNP difference to ‘confirm’ a link is not yet established ( Perez-Lago et al . , 2014 ) . No population-based study to-date has applied long-term large-scale whole genome sequencing in a high prevalence area ( Luo et al . , 2014; Walker et al . , 2014 ) , it is much more challenging to interpret transmission networks when there are many possible sources of infection . Yet understanding transmission in high prevalence areas would have the greatest public health benefit . As part of the Karonga Prevention Study in Malawi , we assess transmission using whole genome sequencing in the whole district over 15 years . We show decreasing transmission over time and marked variation between M . tuberculosis lineages 1–4 which are unconfounded by host differences . 2 Results Figure 2 shows the SNP distances between all possible pairs of samples in the data set ( including more than one per individual in some cases ) . Peaks corresponding to large numbers of SNPs represent comparisons between lineages . On the basis of the distribution , we chose cut-offs at 5 and 10 SNPs for distinguishing links . Similar figures were drawn for the mutation rate ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) . We have previously shown that patients with relapse had up to 8 SNPs difference ( Guerra-Assuncao et al . , 2014 ) , and these cut-offs are similar to those used in other studies ( Bryant et al . , 2013; Walker et al . , 2013 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 05166 . 005Figure 2 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 05166 . 006 To construct the transmission network , we included links of up to 10 SNPs difference . We included one sample per person-episode of disease and excluded extra-pulmonary cases as they cannot transmit . Example clusters are shown in Figure 3 , and the full transmission network in Figure 3—figure supplement 1 . Overall , after excluding relapses ( recurrences with ≤10 SNPs difference from the initial episode ) , 66% of patients were in clusters with at least one other patient . Clusters ranged in size from 2 to 36 ( Figure 4A ) , with 23% of patients in clusters of 10 or more . The size of the clusters varied by lineage ( Figure 4B ) : compared to lineage-4 ( the commonest lineage ) , lineage-2 and lineage-3 strains were more likely to be clustered and in larger clusters and lineage-1 strains were less likely to be clustered and were in smaller clusters . The median cluster size and interquartile range ( IQR ) for lineages 1–4 were 3 ( 1 , 6 ) , 13 ( 7 , 24 ) , 7 ( 2 , 22 ) , and 3 ( 1 , 8 ) , respectively . The p-values for differences between lineages were similar if non-clustered strains were excluded . 10 . 7554/eLife . 05166 . 007Figure 3 . Examples of clusters built using SeqTrack .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 05166 . 011 Overall , of 824 links with 0–10 SNPs identified in the networks , 255 ( 31% ) had 0 SNPs different , 182 ( 22% ) had 1 SNP , 127 ( 15% ) had 2 SNPs , 77 ( 9% ) had 3 SNPs , 52 ( 6% ) had 4 SNPs , 32 ( 4% ) had 5 SNPs , and 99 ( 12% ) had 6–10 SNPs different . The number of SNPs correlated with the time between disease onset in the pairs of individuals linked in the network ( Figure 4C ) : linear regression r2 = 10% , p < 0 . 001 . The regression coefficient suggests a mutation rate of 0 . 26 SNPs/year ( 95% CI 0 . 21–0 . 31 ) . The regression results were the same if sputum collection dates were used instead of disease onset dates . The within-patient mutation rate was calculated in 74 individuals with multiple specimens , including 51 relapses , allowing ≤10 SNPs , and using the first and last specimens if there were more than two . The estimated mutation rate was 0 . 45 SNPs/year ( 95% CI 0 . 15–0 . 75 ) , r2 = 11% , p = 0 . 004 ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) . Figure 4D shows the number of SNPs in the likely transmissions identified from the network , by lineage . Lineage-2 had the lowest number of SNPs per transmission , and lineage 1 the highest . The median mutation rates per year for the different lineages were lineage-1 , 0 . 58 ( IQR 0 . 11–1 . 9 ) ; lineage-2 , 0 . 11 ( 0–0 . 66 ) ; lineage-3 , 0 . 35 ( 0–1 . 1 ) ; lineage-4 , 0 . 40 ( 0–1 . 2 ) ( p = 0 . 004 , equality-of-medians test ) . The regression of number of SNPs by number of days showed no clear differences between lineages ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2 ) . We investigated the number of SNPs in the likely transmissions by smear status , HIV status , and isoniazid resistance of the initial and subsequent cases . There were no differences by the characteristics of the first case , but transmissions to smear-positive subsequent cases had slightly more SNPs than those to smear-negative subsequent cases ( p = 0 . 05 ) ; and those to HIV-negative subsequent cases had slightly more SNPs than those to HIV positive subsequent cases ( p = 0 . 02 ) . Using mutation rates , the results were similar , but with smaller differences by smear status and HIV status of the subsequent case ( p = 0 . 06 and 0 . 08 , respectively ) . For further analysis of transmission , we excluded 77 uncertain links ( i . e . , with 6–10 SNPs and mutation rate ≥0 . 003 SNPS/day , Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) . A case of tuberculosis was defined as being due to recent infection if a source case was identified in the network within the previous 5 years , and not being due to recent infection if no source was identified or if the closest source ( in terms of number of SNPs ) was more than 5 years earlier . Overall , 38% of patients had evidence of recent infection ( Table 2 ) . This was the highest for lineage-2 ( 65% ) and the lowest for lineage-1 ( 31% ) . Linkage with a recent source case was less common in older age groups , in those who had been living outside the district , and in more recent years , with the proportion linked decreasing from 45% in 1999–2001 to 30% in 2008–2010 . These trends persisted after adjusting for each other ( Table 2 ) . There was no association of linkage with sex , HIV status , sputum smear status , or isoniazid resistance and adjusting for these did not affect the results . The effect of village of birth was lost after adjusting for recent residence . 10 . 7554/eLife . 05166 . 012Table 2 .

Odds ratios ( OR ) calculated using logistic regression . *In this model a dummy variable was used for the 32 individuals with missing data on recent residence . †Test for trend . From the network , 32% of individuals were linked as likely sources of infection to at least one other individual . Individuals were sources for up to 12 others , with 293 ( 22% ) linked to one , 76 ( 6% ) linked to two , 22 ( 2% ) linked to three , 14 ( 1% ) linked to four , and 26 ( 2% ) linked to five or more . Table 3 shows the association of characteristics of the index episode with the likelihood of transmission , using ordered logistic regression . There were more transmissions from those with positive smears , and with tuberculosis in the earlier years . Lineage-2 and lineage-3 strains were more likely to transmit than lineage-4 , and these differences were more marked after adjustment for year , age , sex , and smear status . Place of birth and recent residence were weakly associated with onward transmission , and further adjusting for these or the other factors in the table did not affect the results . 10 . 7554/eLife . 05166 . 013Table 3 .

Extrapulmonary cases and cases occurring after 2007 were excluded . Comparing those with any transmissions vs those with none in a logistic regression model gave very similar results ( not shown ) . Restricting the links to those within 3 years of the index episode , there was still a strong trend with year: the odds ratios from the ordered logistic regression analysis , adjusted for lineage , age , sex , and smear status , for the year groups 1999–2001 , 2002–2004 and 2005–2007 , compared to 1995–1998 , were 0 . 47 ( 95% CI 0 . 33–0 . 66 ) , 0 . 35 ( 0 . 25–0 . 50 ) , and 0 . 37 ( 0 . 25–0 . 54 ) , respectively . 3 Discussion This is the largest whole genome sequencing study of M . tuberculosis transmission to-date , and the first to use a network approach . We show that this approach is feasible and that with long-term , population-wide data , important inferences can be made about transmission . In this population , although lineage-4 has been present for longer ( Glynn et al . , 2010 ) , lineages are not now associated with area of birth or recent residence , so differences by lineage are unlikely to be confounded by associations with host sub-populations . The mutation rates in this study are consistent with those from other settings ( Bryant et al . , 2013; Walker et al . , 2013 ) and in vitro ( Ford et al . , 2013 ) . This is the largest study to measure between-patient mutation rates . Although the confidence intervals on the estimate are narrow , there is considerable variation as others have found . The measure assumes the correct source has been identified and uses the time interval between dates of when the disease was first diagnosed or specimen collection as necessarily crude approximations of the time since divergence of the samples from their common ancestor . Furthermore , there is a bottleneck on transmission: most infections probably arise from one or very few organisms ( Lurie , 1964 ) , which may be minority strains in the first case . The within-patient estimate of mutation rate does not have the same measurement problems and gave a consistent result . We showed striking differences between the lineages in cluster size , the proportion of disease due to recent transmission and transmissibility . Lineage-1 formed the smallest clusters , with the largest SNP differences . Patients with lineage-1 strains were the least likely to have disease due to recent transmission and were less likely to transmit and cause new cases than those with lineages 2 or 3 . These observations suggest a lower propensity to cause disease , which may explain lineage-1's association with HIV infection , if it is less likely to cause active disease in those who are not immunosuppressed . Lineage-1 strains have been associated with lower virulence in animal models ( Narayanan et al . , 2008; Reiling et al . , 2013 ) . Lineage-2 formed large clusters with small SNP differences . It had the highest proportion of disease due to recent transmission and the highest proportion of transmissions . Increased virulence in lineage-2 has been suggested previously ( Parwati et al . , 2010 ) , often in association with drug resistance , but in this population all lineage-2 strains were drug sensitive . Despite these associations that suggest higher virulence and transmissibility , the proportion of cases due to lineage-2 did not increase over the period . We have previously reported that lineage-2 was first detected in this area in 1991 , initially increased , and then plateaued from around 2000 ( Glynn et al . , 2005a , 2010 ) . This may explain the lower proportion of lineage-2 strains in the oldest age group . The high proportion of linked cases with lineage-2 could reflect few imported ( and therefore unlinked ) cases , although there was no association between lineage and immigration . In contrast , lineage-3 increased as a proportion of tuberculosis cases over time . It was associated with an intermediate proportion of disease due to recent infection and high transmission . In this population , it is also associated with relapse . Lineage-4 had smaller cluster sizes than lineages 2 and 3 . It remains the most common lineage in this population , although the proportion has fallen over time . Over the period of the study , the proportion of cases due to recent transmission decreased from 46% to 30% , and the proportion of cases transmitting and giving rise to new cases of tuberculosis also fell markedly . This correlates with a reduction in tuberculosis incidence over this period ( Mboma et al . , 2013 ) . It suggests a considerable success of the tuberculosis and HIV control programmes , despite the potential for M . tuberculosis transmission in antiretroviral clinics . We found no association with HIV infection in the proportion of disease due to recent infection ( in contrast to our findings with RFLP in the earlier period [Houben et al . , 2009 , 2010] ) or in transmissibility . Social clustering of HIV-infected individuals may increase the opportunities for transmission to susceptible individuals who manifest disease , balancing out any decreased transmissibility . The change from our earlier findings could be due to the reduced transmission in the population and to the increasing use of isoniazid prophylaxis and antiretroviral therapy in HIV-positive individuals . In this study , we had high quality whole genome sequence data on 72% of culture-positive patients over 15 years . While this is a high proportion , links will be missed , and the best link found may not be the correct one ( especially when there are multiple patients with identical strains ) . Missing links will lead to underestimation of the proportion of disease due to recent transmission and of transmissions . The missing and wrongly attributed links are likely to be randomly distributed , leading to non-differential misclassification of linkage , and underestimation of associations with lineage and other factors . This large , long-term study provides strong evidence for differences in transmission patterns and virulence between the M . tuberculosis lineages , particularly high transmissibility and virulence for lineages 2 and 3 and low transmissibility and virulence for lineage-1 , which are unrelated to drug resistance , HIV infection , or host sub-population . 4 Materials and methods In Karonga District , northern Malawi ( population approximately 300 , 000 ) , project staff at the hospital and peripheral health centres identify individuals with suspected tuberculosis ( Crampin et al . , 2009 ) , and sputum and other specimens are taken . All diagnosed tuberculosis patients are interviewed , and HIV-tested , after counselling and if consent is given . The incidence of new smear-positive tuberculosis in adults in the district has fallen from 124/100000/year to 87/100000/year over the period of this study , with about 6% isoniazid resistance and <1% multidrug resistance ( Mboma et al . , 2013 ) . Adult HIV prevalence in the area is around 10% . Approval for the study was given by the ethics committee of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine ( #5067 ) and the Malawian National Health Sciences Research Committee ( #424 ) . Informed consent was obtained from all participants . Culture is performed in the project laboratories in Malawi , with species identification and drug susceptibility testing in the UK Mycobacterium Reference Laboratory ( Mboma et al . , 2013 ) . RFLP was performed on cultures from all patients from late 1995–2008 ( Glynn et al . , 2005b ) . We processed all available stored DNA samples or cultures from 1995 to 2010 for whole genome sequencing at the Sanger Institute , using Illumina HiSeq 2000 , paired-end reads of length 100 base-pairs . We used trimmomatic software ( http://www . usadellab . org/cms/ ? page=trimmomatic ) to remove low-quality reads and low-quality 3′ ends of reads , keeping only reads ≥50 base-pairs long , with nucleotides >Q27 ( equivalent to a risk of error of <0 . 2% per read per base-pair ) . We mapped reads for each sample against the H37Rv reference genome ( Genbank assession: AL123456 . 3 ) , using the BWA-mem algorithm ( http://bio-bwa . sourceforge . net/ ) ( Li , 2013 ) . We excluded samples with average genomic coverage less than 10-fold . We identified SNP positions using SAMtools ( http://samtools . sourceforge . net/ ) ( Li et al . , 2009 ) . Sample genotypes were called using the majority allele ( minimum frequency 75% ) in positions supported by at least 20-fold coverage; otherwise we classified them as missing ( thus ignoring heterozygous calls ) . We excluded samples with >15% missing genotype calls , to remove possible contaminated or mixed samples or technical errors . ( The proportion of mixed strains is low in this setting [Mallard et al . , 2010] ) . We excluded genome positions with >15% missing genotypes , and those in highly repetitive and variable regions ( e . g . , PE/PPE genes ) . In the final analysis , 94% of the M . tuberculosis genome was analysed for variants . Median coverage was 88-fold , mean 127 . Spoligotyping was performed in silico using SpolPred ( Coll et al . , 2012 ) . Lineages were defined from spoligotype families ( Demay et al . , 2012 ) . We calculated SNP distances between sequences using the ape library in the R statistical package ( http://cran . r-project . org/ ) . We computed a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree including all samples , using RAxML , using the GTRCAT model . For the transmission network , we used the SeqTrack package in R ( Jombart et al . , 2011 ) , using one sample per person-episode of disease , excluding episodes of extrapulmonary tuberculosis ( as these cannot transmit ) . This builds a minimum-spanning tree , minimizing the genomic distance between links and keeping the disease onset dates coherent . Based on our data , we allowed up to 10 SNPs difference for inclusion in the networks . The suitability of the cut-off was assessed by examination of the SNP differences within and between patients . We have previously shown in 92 patients in this data set with repeat samples from the same or different episodes of disease that , using the same pipeline , there is a clear bimodal distribution , with pairs of samples either having up to 8 SNPs between them or more than 100 SNPs ( Guerra-Assuncao et al . , 2014 ) . Furthermore , among 187 pairs of individuals with epidemiological links , 62 had ≤10 SNPs , 9 had 10–99 SNPs , and 116 had ≥100 SNPs . Statistical analysis used STATA 13 ( http://www . stata . com/ ) . We estimated the between-patient mutation rate using linear regression of the number of SNPs by time between disease onset dates ( taken as the date of first evidence of tuberculosis—the earliest of date of collection of the first positive sample , or registration or treatment ) in the patients connected in the network . This analysis was repeated using dates of specimen collection . For comparison , we calculated the within-patient mutation rate , in individuals with more than one specimen from the same episode of disease or from a relapse , also using a cut-off of ≤10 SNPs . We compared the size of the clusters by lineage . Among the likely transmissions ( ≤10 SNPs ) , we examined the number of SNP differences and mutation rates by lineage , and characteristics of the index and subsequent case , using non-parametric tests ( Wilcoxon rank-sum and the equality-of-medians test ) . For the analyses of risk factors for disease due to recently acquired infection and for transmissibility , we classified links with 6–10 SNPs different as uncertain unless the mutation rate was <0 . 003 SNPs/day , to allow for larger changes over long time periods . Those patients with uncertain links were excluded from the risk factor analyses . The SeqTrack network shows the most likely source of infection for each case . For groups of cases with zero SNPs between them the one closest in date was chosen . A case was defined as due to recently acquired infection if the most likely source was within 5 years , and not due to recent infection if there was no source identified or if the source was earlier than this ( even if there were other closely related strains within 5 years ) . In this analysis of ‘backwards’ links , we used the first 3 years of data only for identifying previous links . We examined risk factors for disease due to recent infection among individuals with their first episode of tuberculosis , using logistic regression . The multivariable analysis included lineage , age , sex , and year a priori , and other factors if they were associated with recent infection after adjustment for these , or if they confounded other variables . The SeqTrack network links can also be used to examine forward transmission that results in disease . In this analysis , we used the last 3 years of data only to identify transmissions that had taken place , to allow time for transmissions causing new cases . We used ordered logistic regression to assess risk factors for transmission and the number of transmissions . In the multivariable analysis , we adjusted for lineage , age , sex , year , and sputum smear status of the index case a priori , and assessed confounding by other factors . We repeated the analysis using logistic regression , comparing any transmissions vs none . Since those in later years had less time for transmission to be detected , we examined the effect of calendar period using transmission within 3 years of the index case .

To mentally represent your family , for example , you could group your family members into men and women , or group them based on where they live . But a more intuitive approach for most people is to organize family members by generation: child , sibling , parent , grandparent . It is as though we instinctively place each family member along a mental line , from young to old . We use mental lines to organize other types of information too , most notably numbers . But can we also use them to represent new information ? Luyckx et al . trained healthy volunteers to associate pictures of six different colored donkeys with six different reward probabilities . One donkey was followed by reward 5% of the time , another was followed by reward 95% of the time , and so on . Through trial and error , the volunteers learned to rank the donkeys in terms of how likely they were to precede a reward . Luyckx et al . then compared the volunteers’ brain activity while viewing the donkeys to their brain activity while viewing the numbers 1 to 6 . The donkeys evoked patterns of electrical brain activity corresponding to the number that signaled their place on a mental line . Thus , donkey 1 , with the lowest reward probability , produced a pattern of brain activity similar to that of the number 1 , and so on for the others . This suggests that rather than learning in an unstructured way , we use past knowledge of relations among stimuli to organize new information . This phenomenon is called structural alignment . The results of Luyckx et al . provide the first evidence from brain activity to support structural alignment . They suggest that we use a general understanding of how the world is structured to learn new things . This could be relevant to both education and artificial intelligence . People , and computers , may learn more effectively if taught about the relations between items , rather than just the items in isolation .", "article": "1 Introduction The ability to learn rapidly from limited data is a key ingredient of human intelligence . For example , on moving to a new city , you will rapidly discover which restaurants offer good food and which neighbors provide enjoyable company . Current models of learning propose that appetitive actions toward novel stimuli are learned tabula rasa via reinforcement ( Sutton and Barto , 2018 ) , and these models explain the amplitude of neural signals in diverse brain regions during reward-guided choices in humans and other animals ( Dolan and Dayan , 2013; O'Doherty et al . , 2003; Schultz et al . , 1997 ) . However , reinforcement learning models learn only gradually , and even when coupled with powerful function approximation methods , exhibit limited generalization beyond their training domain ( Mnih et al . , 2015 ) . This has led to the suggestion they are ill-equipped to fully describe human learning ( Lake et al . , 2017 ) . By contrast , cognitive scientists have ascribed human intelligence to the formation of abstract knowledge representations ( or ‘concepts’ ) that delimit the structural forms that new data is likely to take ( Gentner , 2010; Kemp and Tenenbaum , 2008; Tenenbaum et al . , 2011 ) . Indeed , real-world data can often be described by simple relational structures , such as a tree , a grid or a ring ( Tenenbaum et al . , 2011 ) . Humans may infer relational structure through probabilistic computation ( Kemp et al . , 2010 ) and a long-standing theory proposes that humans understand new domains by their alignment with existing relational structures ( Gentner , 1983 ) . However , these models are often criticized for failing to specify how concepts might be plausibly encoded or computed in neural circuits ( McClelland et al . , 2010 ) . A pressing concern , thus , is to provide a mechanistic account of how relational knowledge is encoded and generalized in the human brain ( Tervo et al . , 2016 ) . The current project was inspired by recent observations that the representational geometry of human neural signals evoked by symbolic numbers respects their relative cardinality . In scalp M/EEG signals , neural patterns evoked by Arabic digits vary continuously with numerical distance , such that multivariate signals for ‘3’ are more similar to those for ‘4’ than ‘5’ . ( Spitzer et al . , 2017; Teichmann et al . , 2018 ) . In scalp M/EEG signals , neural patterns evoked by Arabic digits vary continuously with numerical distance , such that multivariate signals for ‘3’ are more similar to those for ‘4’ than ‘5’ . Number is a symbolic system that expresses magnitude in abstract form ( Bueti and Walsh , 2009; Fischer and Shaki , 2018; Walsh , 2003 ) and so we reasoned that continuously varying neural signals evoked by numbers might be indexing a conceptual basis set that supports one-dimensional encoding of novel stimuli . In the domain of reward-guided learning , a compact description of the stimulus space projects data into a single dimension that runs from ‘bad’ to ‘good’ . Here , thus , we asked humans to learn the reward probabilities associated with novel , high-dimensional visual images , and measured whether the stimuli come to elicit neural patterns that map onto one-dimensional neural codes for numerical magnitude . 2 Results Using representational similarity analysis ( RSA ) ( Kriegeskorte and Kievit , 2013 ) , we replicated the previous finding ( Spitzer et al . , 2017; Teichmann et al . , 2018 ) that patterns of neural activity across the scalp from ~100 ms onwards were increasingly dissimilar for numbers with more divergent magnitude , that is codes for ‘3’ and ‘5’ were more dissimilar than those for ‘3’ and ‘4’ ( Figure 1B , green line ) . This occurred irrespective of task framing ( report higher vs . lower average ) and category ( orange vs . blue numbers ) , suggesting that neural signals encoded an abstract representation of magnitude and not solely a decision-related quantity such as choice certainty ( Spitzer et al . , 2017 ) . Next , we used RSA to examine the neural patterns evoked by bandits . We found that multivariate EEG signals varied with subjective bandit ranks , with bandits that paid out with nearby probabilities eliciting more similar neural patterns ( from ~100 ms onwards; Figure 1B , blue line ) . Our key question was whether there was a shared neural code for numerical magnitude and reward probability . We found that EEG signals elicited by digit ‘6’ were more similar to those evoked by the most valuable bandit , and digit one predicted the bandit least likely to pay out , with a similar convergence for intermediate numbers and bandits ( Figure 2A ) . Cross-validation of neural signals elicited by all numbers ( 1 to 6 ) and bandits ( inverse ranks 1–6 ) was stable and reliable from 300 to 650 ms post-stimulus , as demonstrated by cross-temporal RSA ( Figure 2B ) . We conducted several control analyses to further explore the nature of this effect . The cross-validation effect was not driven by patterns within a single number/bandit pair , as it remained robust to the removal of any one of the six number/bandit pairs ( Figure 2C ) . In particular , although the largest number/most valuable bandit cross-validation appeared more dissimilar to other numbers/bandits , the effect persisted when only numbers/bandits 1–5 were included in the analysis ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) . We then asked whether each number was more similar to its equivalent bandit than to other bandits ( e . g . number 3 and bandit 3 , the ‘on-diagonal’ information in Figure 3A ) , by computing an ‘Exemplar Discriminability Index’ ( EDI ) ( Nili et al . , 2016 ) . Additionally , we asked whether numbers showed a gradually increasing dissimilarity to non-identical bandits ( e . g . whether number three was more similar to bandit 2/4 than bandit 1/5 , the ‘off-diagonal’ information in Figure 3B ) . Both of these effects were independently reliable , suggesting not only that each number shares a representation with its corresponding bandit , but that the transitive patterns of encoding numbers and bandits are in a common register in neural signals . Past work has identified overlapping choice biases in numerical cognition and economic decisions ( Kanayet et al . , 2014; Schley and Peters , 2014 ) . Next thus , we asked how patterns of behavior in the numerical and bandit tasks were related to one another by creating choice matrices encoding the difference in relative weight given to each number or bandit in the choices made by participants . For the numerical task , we computed decision weights for each number in the choice using an averaging approach ( see Materials and methods ) and plotted the relative difference in these weights for each combination of numbers ( Figure 4A ) . For the bandit task , this was simply the probability of choosing the subjectively highest valued bandit for each combination of bandits ( Figure 4B ) . Although choice matrices for numbers and bandits were on average correlated across participants ( rτ¯= 0 . 32 , Z = 5 . 65 , p < 0 . 0001 , Wilcoxon signed rank test ) , this correlation disappeared when subtracting the group average choice matrices and correlating the residual matrices ( rτ¯= -0 . 02 , Z = -0 . 49 , p = 0 . 63 ) . In other words , we were not able to identify shared variation in individual weighting of numbers 1-6 and bandits 1-6 in behavior alone , perhaps because of the different nature of the decision required in each task . Subsequently , we asked how these choice matrices explained variance in patterns of neural similarity , that is whether the behavior explained shared variation in the neural structure alignment for numbers and bandits . To this end , we substituted the linear representational distance matrix used for earlier analyses ( i . e . one that assumes equal spacing among adjacent numbers and bandits ) with the subject-specific choice matrices computed from behavior and repeated the analyses above . This allowed us to ask how patterns of neural similarity among both numbers and bandits were explained by variance in subject-specific choice matrices . For each neural pattern , we used a regression-based approach in which choice matrices from numbers and bandits were entered as competing regressors . Interestingly , we found that choice patterns from the numerical task explained variance in the neural patterns for both numbers and bandits , but choice patterns from the bandit task only explained variance in the neural patterns of the bandit task ( Figure 4C–D ) ( Pcluster <0 . 005 ) . One interpretation of this finding is that humans used their intrinsic sense of magnitude when forming neural representations of the bandits , but not vice versa . We note in passing that this asymmetry is not secondary to the ordering of the two tasks , which was fully counterbalanced across participants . In previous work , we observed that participants tended to give relatively greater weight to larger magnitudes during the numerical decision task , for example numbers '5' and '6' had disproportionate impact on averaging judgments ( Spitzer et al . , 2017 ) . This finding was replicated in the current data ( Figure 4E-F ) . Human choices were best fit by a power-law model in which participants averaged and compared distorted numerical values xk with k= 2 . 04 ± 1 . 11 ( k> 1: t ( 45 ) = 12 . 47 , p < 0 . 001 ) . This prompted us to ask whether any shared variance between behavioral choice matrices and neural signals for the two tasks could be explained by subject-specific differences in the pattern of compression or anti-compression in the mental number line , as characterized by this model . Turning to the neural data , we thus generated candidate representational dissimilarity matrices ( RDMs ) under the assumption that distance in neural space can likewise be non-linear and best described by a distortion given by the same power-law model , that is of the form xk . We found that in both numerical and bandit tasks the best fitting RDM was parameterized by k> 1 [numerical: k= 1 . 73 ± 0 . 82 , t ( 45 ) = 14 . 34 , p < 0 . 001; bandit: k= 1 . 72 ± 0 . 85 , t ( 45 ) = 13 . 65 , p < 0 . 001] . In other words , we observed that the anti-compressed number line estimated from behavior was reflected , on average , in both the neural representation of numbers and bandits . However , when we correlated the subject-specific model parameter k from behavior with estimates obtained from the neural data from either task , we found that although the degree of behavioral anti-compression strongly predicted the neural anti-compression for the numerical task ( ρ= 0 . 57 , p = 0 . 0004 ) , it did not for the bandit task ( ρ= -0 . 13 , p = 0 . 39 ) . One interpretation of this result is that the variance linking the mental number line to the representation of bandits ( i . e . from Figure 4D ) is not simply due to individual differences in compression or anti-compression of the mental representations of numbers and bandits but must lie in a subspace not captured by this simple unidimensional model . Recent work has suggested that during categorization , posterior parietal neurons in the monkeys are strikingly low-dimensional , as if the parietal cortex were engaging in a gain control process that projected stimulus features or timings on a single axis ( Fitzgerald et al . , 2013; Ganguli et al . , 2008; Platt and Glimcher , 1999; Wang et al . , 2018 ) . Indeed , we observed a centro-parietal positivity ( CPP ) that varied with the magnitude of both numbers and reward probabilities ( Figure 5A–B ) . This signal resembles a previously described EEG signal , that has been found to scale with the choice certainty in perceptual ( O'Connell et al . , 2012 ) and economic tasks ( Pisauro et al . , 2017 ) . However , in our numerical task the CPP followed an approximately ascending pattern from lower to higher numbers regardless of task framing ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) or color category . The cross-validation effect persisted even after the CPP had been regressed out of the data ( Figure 5—figure supplement 2 ) . This suggests that ( a ) the CPP in our task may represent a notion of magnitude , not a certainty signal alone; and ( b ) that this signal is not the sole driver of our multivariate findings . Nevertheless , to understand the dimensionality of the number and bandit representations ( and the subspace in which they aligned ) , we used two dimensionality reduction techniques , singular value decomposition ( SVD ) and multidimensional scaling ( MDS ) . First , using SVD , we systematically removed dimensions from the EEG data and recomputed our number-bandit cross-validation scores ( Figure 5C ) . We found that probabilistic reward learning was supported by a low-dimensional neural magnitude code , with reliable effects persisting when all but two eigenvectors were removed from the data but significantly attenuated when only a single dimension was retained in the EEG data . Indeed , 3D and full ( high-dimensional ) solutions led to statistically equivalent cross-validation , with some attenuation of the effect when two dimensions were retained and a more dramatic decrease with only a single dimension . To further establish that the cross-validation effect was not solely driven by the observed univariate activity , we again used SVD to remove the first dimension and re-computed the cross-validation statistics ( Figure 5—figure supplement 3 ) . A significant cluster of cross-validation emerged at the same time as the originally observed effect together with a previously unobserved cluster later in time ( Pcluster <0 . 05 ) . In summary , aside from a major univariate component to our cross-validation effect , there remains a shared pattern that lies in higher dimensions of the data . Secondly , we used MDS to visualize the first dimensions of the concatenated number/bandit data . This disclosed an axis pertaining to magnitude and another approximately corresponding to certainty along which , especially for the bandits , the large ( or best ) and small ( or worst ) items diverged from the others ( Figure 5D and Video 1 ) . In other words , the numbers and bandits align principally along a single magnitude axis but with an additional contribution from a second factor potentially encoding choice certainty . What are the potential benefits of the shared coding scheme we observed in neural signals ? One possibility is that shared structure can promote generalization , such that new relational structures ( i . e . the transitive relations among bandits as a function of their reward probability ) are learned faster and more effectively when an existing scaffold ( such as a transitive representation of number ) has been previously learned . We are unable to test for this benefit directly in our human data , because all participants were numerate adult humans , denying us an appropriate control condition . However , to demonstrate the theoretical benefit of shared coding at the mechanistic level , we turned to a simple computational tool , a feedforward neural network ( Figure 6A ) . Neural networks are not constrained to make inferences over structure , but structured representations may emerge naturally in the weights during training ( McClelland et al . , 2010 ) . Here , we confronted the network with two diffeent stimulus sets in turn that ( like our numbers and bandits ) shared the same similarity structure . We then asked if the shared structure facilitates retraining on the second set after learning the first . The network was first trained on inputs xa arriving at input units XA , and after convergence , retrained on inputs xb fed into units XB ( where XA and XB are separate input modules that project to a common hidden layer H ) . Inputs xb were 6 random vectors constructed to have the same continuously varying similarity structure as the bandits , whereas inputs xa consisted of either a different set of six random vectors with the same second-order structure , or a shuffled control lacking the second-order structure . Relearning on xb proceeded faster when inputs shared a common structure with xa ( Figure 6B-D ) . In a second control , we shuffled the weights W2 connecting the hidden layer to the output layer after convergence on inputs xa , destroying the mapping of activity patterns in the hidden layer to the output layer . RSA conducted after retraining revealed reliable cross-validated patterns of activity in the hidden units only for the condition where xa and xb shared an underlying structure and weights W2 were kept intact ( Figure 6E ) , mirroring the result from the human neural data . 3 Discussion We report that during a probabilistic reward-guided learning task involving arbitrary images ( ‘bandits’ ) , stimuli with high payout probability shared a neural code with larger numbers , and those with lower value shared a neural code with lower numbers . We interpret these data as indicating that an abstract neural code for magnitude forms a conceptual basis set or ‘scaffold’ for learning new information , such as the reward probabilities associated with novel stimuli . Rather than encoding stimulus value in an unstructured value function or lookup table ( as is common in RL models ) , our data suggest that humans project available stimuli onto a low-dimensional axis that runs from ‘bad’ to ‘good’ . This neural axis is aligned with the mental number line , suggesting that humans recycle an abstract concept of magnitude to encode reward probabilities . Learning a structured representation of value will have the benefit of allowing new inductive inferences , such as inferring transitive preferences among economic goods without exhaustive pairwise comparison ( Alfred et al . , 2018 ) , and facilitate read-out in downstream brain areas , related perhaps to the notion of a ‘common currency’ for reward ( Levy and Glimcher , 2012 ) . Our neural network simulations provide a demonstration of how shared structure can promote generalization and thus faster learning , even for stimuli with different physical input features . However , our design was not suited to directly test a benefit of learning between tasks , since our participants were numerate adults when they entered the experiment . In further work , it would be of particular interest to teach participants two new transitive structures , each associated with a different stimulus set , and test whether the extent to which the neural codes align predicts learning rates for the second stimulus set – a direct prediction that emerges from our computational simulations . We did , however , find a link between the transitive neural codes and participants’ behavior . Choice patterns in the two tasks were positively correlated , and how participants treated numbers in the numerical task was reflected in the neural patterns of both tasks . Furthermore , we found that participants tended to overweight larger numbers and this non-linear weighting correlated highly with non-linear representations at the neural level , at least in the numerical task . Why we did not find a correlation with non-linearities in the neural patterns of the bandit task is unclear . One speculation is that the non-linearity arises at a later stage in the processing of stimuli and is specific to the task at hand . One major limitation of our approach is the limited spatial resolution of EEG . This leaves open the question of the true dimensionality of the shared neural code . Our investigations using dimensionality reduction techniques indicate that the code in EEG signals is low-dimensional but not simply univariate . Thus , whilst our work is consistent with previous studies showing that the amplitude of centro-parietal EEG signals scales with number ( Spitzer et al . , 2017 ) and the value of economic prospects , such as food items ( Pisauro et al . , 2017 ) , it also suggests a more complex pattern encoding the shared structure among stimuli defined by transitive relations . However , it would be instructive to measure the effect using techniques that potentially afford higher spatial resolution , such as MEG or fMRI . More generally , however , our work is consistent with theories that have suggested that neural signals for magnitude in the parietal cortex may provide a conceptual bridge between different metrics such as space , time and number ( Bueti and Walsh , 2009; Chafee , 2013; Fitzgerald et al . , 2013; Parkinson et al . , 2014; Walsh , 2003 ) . 4 Materials and methods Forty-nine healthy participants ( Experiment 1a = 24 , Experiment 1b = 25 ) participated in behavioral and EEG testing at the University of Oxford . Sample size for Experiment 1a was determined based on common sample sizes in the field and a similar size was used in Experiment 1b for the replication . Two participants from Experiment 1a were excluded from all analyses due to failure to learn in the bandit task ( chance level performance ) and one participant from Experiment 1b due to excessive movement artefacts in the recorded EEG data . All analyses were performed on the remaining 46 participants ( n female = 24 , n right-handed = 43 , age = 24 . 7 ± 4 . 5 ) . All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision , with no history of neurological or psychiatric illness . Participants were compensated for their time at a rate of £10/hr plus additional bonuses based on their performance ( max . £2 . 50 in the numerical task and £5 in the bandit task ) . Informed consent was given before the start of the experiment . The study was approved by the Medical Science Inter-Divisional Research Ethics Committee ( R49578/RE001 ) . Both tasks ( numerical and bandit ) were run within a single recording session , with the order of tasks counterbalanced between participants . Stimuli were created and presented using the Psychophysics Toolbox-3 ( Brainard , 1997; Kleiner et al . , 2007 ) for Matlab ( MathWorks ) and additional custom scripts . The tasks were presented on a 20’’ screen with a resolution of 1600 × 900 , at a refresh rate of 60 Hz and on a grey background . Viewing distance was fixed at approximately 62 cm . The F and J key on a standard QWERTY keyboard served as response keys for left- and right-hand responses , respectively . The EEG signal was recorded using 61 Ag/AgCl sintered surface electrodes ( EasyCap , Herrsching , German ) , a NeuroScan SynAmps RT amplifier , and Curry 7 software ( Compumedics NeuroScan , Charlotte , NC ) . Electrodes were placed according to the extended international 10–20 system , with the right mastoid as recording reference and channel AFz as ground . Additional bipolar electrooculography ( EOG ) was recorded , with two electrodes placed on either temple for recording horizontal EOG and two electrodes above and below the right eye for vertical EOG . All data was recorded at 1 kHz and low-pass filtered online at 200 Hz . All impedances were kept below 10–15 kΩ during the experiment . The data from both tasks were pre-processed following the same pipeline , using functions from the EEGLAB toolbox ( Delorme and Makeig , 2004 ) for Matlab and custom scripts . First the data were down-sampled to 250 Hz , low-pass filtered at 40 Hz and then high-pass filtered at 1 Hz . The continuous recording was visually screened for excessively noisy channels and these were interpolated by the weighted average of the surrounding electrodes . The data was then offline re-referenced to average reference . In the numerical task , epochs were extracted from 1 s before fixation dot onset to 5 . 5 s after . In the bandit task , epochs were extracted from 0 . 5 s before fixation dot onset to 3 s after . Epochs were baselined relative to the full pre-fixation time window . Epochs containing atypical noise ( such as muscle activity ) were rejected after visual inspection . We then performed Independent Component Analysis ( ICA ) and removed components related to eye blink activity and other artefacts ( manually selected for each participant ) . Lastly , the trial epochs were split into smaller stimulus epochs for each digit/bandit and re-baselined based on the pre-stimulus onset time window . For the numerical task , these epochs spanned −65 ms to 850 ms relative to stimulus onset . For the bandit task , they spanned −250 ms to 750 ms . Final analyses focused on the overlapping time window of −65 to 750 ms in both tasks . Experiment 1b was pre-registered as a control experiment ( DOI 10 . 17605/osf . io/ym3gu ) , directly replicating the bandit task and inverting the task framing for the numerical task . We confirmed our proposed hypothesis that task framing would not affect either the direction of the univariate parietal effects ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) or the multivariate patterns ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ) . To increase the power of our analyses , we collapsed the two data sets . All analyses were conducted on the subject level and statistics are reported for the group level . We estimated subjective probabilities for each bandit using a delta-rule model . On every trial , the model compares the ( subjective ) values of the two offered bandits and updates the value of the chosen bandit based on the observed reward during the task: ( 1 ) VC ( t+1 ) =VC ( t ) +α[R ( t ) −VC ( t ) ] , where Vct is the value of the bandit chosen by the participant on trial t , α the learning rate and R the received reward ( either 0 or 1 ) . Value of the chosen bandit is updated for the next trial t+1 , by taking the difference between the observed reward Rt and the expected reward VCt modulated by the size of the learning rate . To obtain estimates of the model’s choices , the values of the two bandits are passed through a sigmoidal response function: ( 2 ) p ( A ) =λ+ ( 1−2λ ) 1+e−ΔV/swhere ΔV=VA-VB , that is the difference in value between the first ( A ) and second ( B ) bandit . The policy parameters s and λ indicate the slope and termination point ( lapse rate ) of the logistic choice function . The latter was fixed to 0 . 05 , equivalent to the bounds of the reward probabilities in the task , and the parameters α and s ( learning rate and slope ) were fit to the data . Best-fitting parameter estimates were obtained by minimizing the negative log-likelihood function using optimization tools in Matlab . Bandit probabilities in the test phase were initialized according to the estimates of subjective reward probability obtained from free-choice trials from phase L2 . Search space was restricted for both parameters between 0 . 0001 and 0 . 5 . Best fitting parameters were then used to estimate trial-by-trial subjective ranks for all bandits per participant by classifying the bandits according to their subjective values . The pre-processed EEG data was first z-scored over all trials , per electrode and time point . To obtain the condition-specific activations at each time point and electrode , we constructed a design matrix using dummy coding for each condition within a task ( numbers 1 to 6 and the six bandits ) and subsequently estimated beta coefficients using a linear regression model for each number or ( ranked ) bandit . These beta coefficients then reflected the trial-average response per condition at each time point and electrode . We then calculated the Euclidean ( or correlation ) distance between the whole-scalp neural signals of each condition pair ( e . g . bandit 1 and bandit 2 ) , resulting in a 6 × 6 representational dissimilarity matrix ( neural RDM ) at each time point for both tasks separately ( Figure 1C ) . Neural RDMs were smoothed over time through convolution with a 60 ms uniform kernel . To test for patterns of numerical distance in the neural RDMs , we created a 6 × 6 magnitude model RDM in which the predicted dissimilarity linearly increased from 0 to 1 as a function of the numerical difference between two numbers . The upper triangles of the model and neural RDM were subsequently correlated using Kendall Tau-a rank correlation ( Figure 1B ) ( Nili et al . , 2014 ) . In the cross-validation analyses , we followed a similar pipeline as the within-task RSA described above , except that beta estimates of condition activation from both tasks were concatenated before calculating the Euclidean distance between all 12 conditions , resulting in a 12 × 12 RDM containing both within-task ( e . g number-number ) and between-task ( e . g . number-bandit ) dissimilarities ( Figure 2A ) . To account for potential differences in the time at which a magnitude code was decodable , we conducted this analysis for all possible combinations of time points ( cross-temporal RSA ) ( King and Dehaene , 2014 ) . Neural RDMs were smoothed over time through convolution with a 60 x 60 ms uniform kernel . In cross-validation , model RDMs were correlated with the lower rectangle of the neural RDM , containing the between-task dissimilarities . The diagonal of the rectangle was included , since on-diagonal information is non-redundant in cross-validation . Correlations were baseline corrected by subtracting the average correlation in the pre-stimulus period to not bias our cluster-identifying algorithm . Significant clusters were identified using cluster-corrected nonparametric permutation tests ( iterations = 1000 , cluster-defining and cluster-level thresholds at p<0 . 005 , unless stated otherwise ) ( Maris and Oostenveld , 2007 ) . We tested to what extent the choice behavior of a task was reflected in the neural patterns through multiple regression ( Figure 4A–D ) . For the numerical task , a model RDM was calculated for each participant based on the differences in choice probability for each number pair ( see below ) . The bandit model RDM was constructed by taking the average probability of choosing the most valuable bandit ( according to the delta-rule model estimates ) for any bandit pair . Both models were vectorized and z-scored and entered as two regressors in a model explaining variance in the neural RDM of either the numerical task ( Figure 4C ) or the bandit task ( Figure 4D ) . Similarly , for the CPP control analyses ( Figure 5—figure supplement 2D–E ) , a model RDM was constructed based on the differences in average peak activity per condition ( see below ) . The CPP model was then entered in a multiple regression together with the magnitude model , to determine whether the variance in neural patterns could be explained by a magnitude code over and above the univariate findings . Normalized EEG epochs were averaged for each digit ( independent of color category ) or for each subjective bandit rank . Based on previous research ( Spitzer et al . , 2017; Twomey et al . , 2015 ) , we selected seven centro-parietal electrodes ( CP1 , P1 , POz , CPz , CP2 and P2 ) and averaged the event-related potentials ( ERP ) over these electrodes for each stimulus . Next , we sought to identify for each task the time window where the disparity in ERP signals was greatest between stimulus types , using a non-parametric omnibus test ( Kruskal-Wallis test ) at every time point . To avoid circular inference , the test was performed in a leave-one-out fashion , determining significance based on the remaining 45 participants . The largest cluster of adjacent significant time points ( p<0 . 01 ) was then determined using FDR correction for multiple comparisons ( Benjamini and Hochberg , 2009 ) . Activity within each individual’s time window was then averaged for each condition and differences in the ERP averages were taken to construct RDMs that were used as control models for RSA ( Figure 5—figure supplement 2 ) . We assessed the dimensionality of the neural data through Singular Value Decomposition ( SVD ) , a method that allows to efficiently obtain principal components in the data through linear transformation . After estimating beta coefficients for each condition , we used SVD at each time point to obtain the diagonal matrix Σ that contained the six singular values . We then systematically reduced the dimensionality of the data by removing the last column of Σ , reconstructed the data under the reduced dimensionality and followed the rest of the cross-validation pipeline as described above . Changes in the strength of the cross-validation were tested by comparing the model – EEG RDM correlations averaged over the 350-600 ms time window , under the different dimensionalities of the data ( Figure 5C ) . To estimate numerical magnitude distortion in the numerical task , we fitted a psychometric model to the choice data ( Figure 3F ) . The model is adapted from that described in Spitzer et al . ( 2017 ) . First , input values ( numbers 1 – 6 in the task ) are normalized between 0 and 1 in six equidistant steps . These normalized values nX are then transformed into a subjective decisional value X^ by exponentiating them with free parameter k . ( 3 ) X^=nXk When k = 1 , X^ is equal to nX . When k > 1 , decision values are exponential , giving relatively higher weights to larger numbers and being more indifferent to smaller numbers . Conversely , when k < 1 , decision values are compressed , giving lower weight to the larger numbers . Next , we model the trial-level decision-value as the sum over all samples X^ . ( 4 ) DV=∑i=110X^i⋅ci⋅l10−iwhere ci is an indicator variable that codes for stimulus category ( orange = -1 , blue = 1 ) and li is a leakage term that exponentially discounts earlier samples in the stream . Finally , the model uses a logistic function for computing choice probabilities: ( 5 ) p ( blue ) =f−11+e− ( B+DV ) /s , where p ( blue ) is the probability of choosing the blue category . s is the inverse slope of the logistic choice function and B captures a simple response bias toward one of the two categories . Finally , f is an indicator variable that codes for the framing of the task , inverting the choice probability for the low frame ( f = 1 ) compared to the high frame ( f= 0 ) . Best fitting parameters for k[0 . 01 – 10] , l[0 – 1] , m[unconstrained] and s [0 . 001 – 8] were obtained using standard optimization tools in Matlab . Model-free decision weights were estimated for each participant using an averaging approach to compare to the model predictions . Choice probabilities for each digit were calculated by averaging over all responses to trials where that digit was present . In order to obtain an estimate of the distortion in neural representational geometry , we generated a range of candidate model RDMs computed from features that were distorted by a parameter k , analogous to the psychometric model . Six equidistant values between 0 and 1 were raised to the power of k ( Equation 3 ) and model RDMs were constructed based on the Euclidean distances after distortion . Parameters that fitted the neural data best were found through exhaustive search through values of k from 0 . 35 – 3 in steps of 0 . 01 , iteratively computing the Kendall Tau-a correlation between the upper triangle of the model RDM and the neural RDM averaged over a time window between 350 and 600 ms . The distortion k associated with the highest correlation was determined in each participant individually and subjected to group-level analysis . Representational geometries for the two tasks were stable in this time window based on the analysis depicted in Figure 2B . We constructed a simple feedforward neural network with 21 input units ( 1 bias unit and two input modules of 20 units , XA and XB ) , 10 hidden units H and 10 output units Y ( Figure 6A ) . The network was trained ( learning rate = 0 . 001 ) to map inputs xa and xb , both consisting of 6 stimuli with 20 features each , onto 6 random vectors . Both inputs were generated by drawing random values from a standard normal distribution . In the crucial test condition , both xa and xb shared a second-order structure of gradually increasing dissimilarity . This was achieved by successively flipping the sign of two more features for each adjacent stimulus . The network learned to minimize the cost-function ( cross-entropy ) with respect to the supervision signal and via backpropagation , first on inputs xa arriving at input units XA , and after 106 iterations it was then retrained on inputs xb fed into units XB . Two control conditions were included to assess the contribution of shared structure to retraining performance . In one control , the model was initially trained on an input xa that was entirely random , that is not constructed using the sign-flipping method . In the second control , hidden-to-output weights W2 were shuffled before retraining on xb . Simulations were run 100 times for each of the conditions ( xa and xb shared structure vs . xa was random; W2 unshuffled vs . shuffled ) . Next , RSA was performed on the hidden unit activations , after convergence had been achieved on retraining , to test for shared representational structure in the hidden units . Each stimulus from xa was fed into XA and xb into XB to obtain hidden unit activations for each stimulus . A cross-validation RDM was then constructed based on the differences in activations between xa and xb for each stimulus and correlated with a magnitude model RDM ( Figure 6E ) .

Volunteers initially performed a memory task while their brain activity was measured using fMRI . This gave a “baseline” level of brain activity . Over the course of several years , the volunteers returned for PET scans and further memory tests . Cognitively normal older adults with greater baseline levels of brain activity – particularly in the hippocampus , a brain region involved in the formation of new memories – showed more beta-amyloid accumulation over the next three to four years . Furthermore , people who accumulated more beta-amyloid also showed a more severe decline in memory . To strengthen these results , a follow up study should be performed that examines how brain activity and amyloid deposition change together over time . In addition , it will be important to test whether methods that reduce brain activity could affect amyloid deposition , thus perhaps reducing the risk of Alzheimer’s disease .", "article": "1 Introduction Beta-amyloid ( Aβ ) is one of the core pathologies of Alzheimer’s disease ( AD ) and Aβ deposition is posited to be the earliest event in a long and complex pathological cascade leading to AD . The amyloid cascade hypothesis suggests that soluble forms of Aβ represent the start of AD , which is ultimately associated with damage in synaptic structure and function and the formation of Aβ plaques ( Hardy , 2009 ) . However , it remains unknown why Aβ deposition occurs in the first place . A substantial body of preclinical research suggests that synaptic activity is linked to Aβ deposition ( Nitsch et al . , 1993; Kamenetz et al . , 2003; Cirrito et al . , 2005; Bero et al . , 2011 ) . Studies using in vivo microdialysis with concurrent field potential recordings have shown that Aβ levels are directly influenced by synaptic activity , in which increases in neuronal activity are sufficient to modulate Aβ levels and plaque growth in a local , region-specific manner ( Cirrito et al . , 2005; Bero et al . , 2011 ) . Furthermore , using an acute brain slice model , rapid effects of synaptic activity on Aβ levels have been shown to be primarily linked to synaptic vesicle exocytosis ( Cirrito et al . , 2005 ) . There is evidence that hyperactivity in the CA3 subregion of the hippocampus in aged rodents may underlie memory deficits associated with aging ( Wilson et al . , 2005; El-Hayek et al . , 2013; Haberman et al . , 2013 ) . This hyperactivity has been regarded as epileptiform in nature in rodents ( Koh et al . , 2010 ) and AD transgenic mouse models ( Palop et al . , 2007 ) . A reversal of memory impairment has been shown with a reduction of hippocampal hyperactivity ( via a low-dose of an anti-epileptic drug ) in age-impaired rodents , AD rodent models , and in mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) ( Koh et al . , 2010; Bakker et al . , 2012 , 2015; Sanchez et al . , 2012 ) . There are at least two proposed hypotheses regarding increased hippocampal activation . It has been suggested that hyperactivity within the hippocampus may occur over the course of normal aging , but hyperactivity may eventually lead to the secretion of Aβ more quickly than would otherwise occur . Alternatively , some have suggested that Aβ may lead to increased neuronal activity . These explanations are not mutually exclusive; both may be occurring leading to a vicious cycle of Aβ production . Human studies have also shown that increased hippocampal activity is associated with memory function and Aβ deposition in aging and MCI ( Bakker et al . , 2012; Brody et al . , 2008; Mormino et al . , 2012; Yassa , 2011; Dickerson et al . , 2005 ) . High-resolution fMRI during memory task performance has localized hyperactivity to the dentate gyrus/CA3 subregions of the hippocampus , which has also been linked to memory deficits in aging and MCI ( Bakker et al . , 2012; Yassa , 2011 ) . Cognitively normal older adults with high Aβ have increased hippocampal and default mode network ( DMN ) activation during episodic memory processing ( Mormino et al . , 2012; Sperling et al . , 2009; Vannini et al . , 2012 ) . Subjects with MCI have shown heightened medial temporal lobe ( MTL ) activation during episodic memory processing that is associated with subsequent cognitive decline ( Dickerson et al . , 2005 , 2004; O'Brien et al . , 2010 ) . A recent study found that individuals with MCI who were Aβ+ at baseline showed increased hippocampal activation at baseline and longitudinally in addition to longitudinal cognitive deficits compared to MCI subjects who were Aβ− ( Huijbers et al . , 2015 ) . Apolipoprotein E4 ( ApoE4 ) carriers have also shown increased MTL activation ( Dennis et al . , 2010; Bookheimer et al . , 2000 ) . Eventually , it appears that hippocampal activity decreases as AD pathology progresses ( O'Brien et al . , 2010; Celone et al . , 2006 ) . In addition to MTL activity , human imaging studies have also shown increased cortical activity in regions associated with the DMN , but also in regions beyond the DMN ( Mormino et al . , 2012; Bookheimer et al . , 2000; Elman et al . , 2014; Jones et al . , 2016; Myers et al . , 2014 ) . A recent study found that older adults with Aβ deposition had increased memory task-related neural activation in the parietal and occipital cortex that was linked to more detailed memory encoding ( Elman et al . , 2014 ) , suggesting the activation increases were compensatory . Other studies have discovered links between Aβ and the DMN such that Aβ aggregates in areas of high intrinsic connectivity ( Myers et al . , 2014 ) and that there is high connectivity between the posterior DMN and hubs of high frontal lobe connectivity that are associated with Aβ accumulation ( Jones et al . , 2016 ) . High Aβ deposition has been found in locations of cortical hubs , such as posterior cingulate , lateral temporal , lateral parietal , and medial prefrontal cortices ( Buckner et al . , 2009 ) . It remains unclear as to whether local amyloid deposition is driving local hyperactivity , if region-specific hyperactivity is linked to global amyloid deposition , or both may be occurring . Previous studies have shown that hyperactive neurons were typically found near amyloid plaques in the cortex ( Busche et al . , 2008 ) , however , increased hippocampal activity occurred before transgenic mice began to deposit amyloid plaques . Hippocampal hyperactivity can occur independent of plaque deposition , while increased activity in cortical neurons is more directly linked to the presence of amyloid plaques . This may be due to a difference in local concentrations of amyloid , different vulnerabilities of cortical versus hippocampal neurons , or both ( Busche et al . , 2012 ) . Another possibility is that hippocampal hyperactivity may drive increased cortical activity in downstream regions that are more directly linked to amyloid deposition or that hippocampal hyperactivity is driving tau deposition in the MTL , which then leads to Aβ deposition . One proposed model suggests that life-long patterns of neural activity may lead to Aβ deposition ( Jagust and Mormino , 2011 ) . Thus far , most studies have examined the link between Aβ and brain activation using cross-sectional data . Longitudinal studies are essential for testing hypotheses about brain activation leading to Aβ accumulation over time and to determine if the rate of Aβ deposition is different in people who show more or less brain activation . In the present study , our goal was to examine how hippocampal neural activity influenced the longitudinal accumulation of global Aβ and if these factors were related to changes in cognition . We hypothesized that cognitively normal older individuals with greater hippocampal activity at baseline would show increased longitudinal Aβ accumulation globally and that this would be associated with memory decline . To test this hypothesis , we performed a study with a baseline assessment of memory during acquisition of functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) to measure task-related neural activity , followed by longitudinal [11C] Pittsburgh Compound-B positron emission tomography ( PIB-PET ) imaging to measure global Aβ deposition across time in addition to repeated assessments of memory . We focused on the California Verbal Learning Test Long-Delay Free Recall ( CVLT ) to measure long-term memory changes over time . 2 Results To determine whether hippocampal activation at baseline predicted longitudinal accumulation of global Aβ , we examined associations between our independent variables of interest ( hippocampal activation and time of PIB ) and the dependent variable ( PIB DVR ) using a linear mixed model ( with age , sex , and education as covariates ) . Time of PIB was determined as relative to baseline MRI . The interaction between hippocampal activation and time of PIB ( hippocampal activation × time ) was the primary effect of interest because it represented the relationship between hippocampal activation and longitudinal PIB DVR change . Results revealed that hippocampal activation at baseline was positively associated with longitudinal amyloid accumulation such that PIB DVR increased at a rate of 0 . 001 units per year for every one hippocampal activation unit [interaction , p=0 . 004 , Table 2] . To visualize this , we plotted the relationship between PIB slope from the model and hippocampal activation contrast values at baseline ( Figure 2a ) , which showed a positive correlation between PIB slope and hippocampal activation . 10 . 7554/eLife . 22978 . 006Figure 2 .

Key: SE = Standard Error , mc = mean-centered , PIB DVR= Pittsburgh Compound B Distributed Volume Ratio . We also performed the same linear mixed model described above , but with non-hippocampal activation as an independent variable to determine if brain activation predicting longitudinal Aβ accumulation was specific to the hippocampus or existed for cortical activity as well . We chose the non-hippocampal regions of bilateral occipital cortex and bilateral inferior frontal gyrus , which similarly to the hippocampus , showed increased activity in PIB+ compared to PIB- subjects in the original study ( Mormino et al . , 2012 ) . However , we did not find an interaction between non-hippocampal cortical activation and longitudinal Aβ accumulation [interaction , t ( 21 ) = 1 . 02 , p=0 . 319; Figure 2b] , suggesting increased brain activation at baseline associated with increased global Aβ accumulation may be MTL specific . To determine whether hippocampal activation at baseline was associated with change in memory performance over time , we examined associations between our independent variables of interest ( hippocampal activation and time of CVLT ) and the dependent variable ( CVLT ) using a linear mixed model . As with time of PIB , time of CVLT was determined as relative to baseline MRI . The interaction between hippocampal activation and time of CVLT ( hippocampal activation × time ) was not significant [interaction , t ( 14 ) = 0 . 786 , p=0 . 445] indicating no relationship between hippocampal activation at baseline and the subsequent rate of memory decline . Next , we examined the relationship between longitudinal Aβ accumulation and memory performance . We examined associations between the independent variables of interest ( PIB slope and time of CVLT ) and the dependent variable ( CVLT ) using a linear mixed model . The interaction between PIB slope and time of CVLT ( PIB slope × time ) was the primary effect of interest because it represented the relationship between Aβ accumulation and memory change over time . Results revealed that increased longitudinal Aβ accumulation was associated with a decline in CVLT score [interaction , p=0 . 023 , Table 3] . To visualize the effect , we plotted the relationship between CVLT slope from the model and PIB slope ( Figure 3 ) , which showed a negative correlation between CVLT slope and PIB slope . Sex [p = 0 . 034] and time of CVLT [p = 0 . 023] also predicted the average CVLT score ( Table 3 ) . The effect of time of CVLT can be seen in Figure 1b , where the average CVLT slope increases over time , by 0 . 41 CVLT units/year . This suggests that while many participants retain their memory abilities over time , longitudinal Aβ accumulation predicts memory decline over time . 10 . 7554/eLife . 22978 . 008Figure 3 .

Based on the observation that hippocampal activation at baseline was related to increasing Aβ deposition over time , we conjectured that the relationships between the three variables in this study were complex . Thus , we examined whether the increased longitudinal Aβ deposition associated with baseline hippocampal activation was linked to memory decline . We tested this relationship using a mediation model , where PIB slope ( mediator , M ) may mediate the relationship between hippocampal activation at baseline ( predictor , X ) and CVLT slope ( outcome , Y ) , with age , sex , and education as covariates . Step 1 tested the effect of X on Y , not including M . Step 2 tested X predicting M , and Steps 3 and 4 tested M|X significant predictor of Y and X|M not a significant predictor of Y . In Step 1 of the model , the regression of hippocampal activation on memory performance , ignoring PIB slope , was not significant [β = 0 . 005 , t = 0 . 473 , p=0 . 641] . In Step 2 , the regression of hippocampal activation on PIB slope was significant [β = 0 . 0005 , t = 2 . 26 , p=0 . 034] . In Step 3 , the regression of PIB slope , controlling for hippocampal activation , on memory performance was significant [β = −25 . 75 , t = −2 . 91 , p=0 . 008] . In Step 4 , when controlling for PIB slope , hippocampal activation was not a significant predictor of memory performance [β = 0 . 018 , t = 1 . 76 , p=0 . 094] . There were no significant effects of age , sex , or education . The bootstrapped unstandardized indirect effect was −0 . 016 and significantly differed from zero , as revealed by a 95% bootstrap confidence interval that was entirely below zero ( confidence interval: −0 . 031 to −0 . 002 ) . Thus , longitudinal amyloid accumulation mediated the relationship between increased baseline hippocampal activation and greater memory decline over time ( Figure 4 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 22978 . 010Figure 4 . Mediation analysis between hippocampal activation , longitudinal amyloid accumulation , and memory decline . Mediation analysis with hippocampal activation at baseline ( predictor , X ) , mediated by [11C] Pittsburgh Compound-B distribution volume ratio slopes ( PIB Slope ) ( mediator , M ) , predicting California Verbal Learning Test Long-Delay Free Recall slope ( CVLT Slope ) . Hippocampal activation positively predicted PIB Slope , PIB Slope negatively predicted CVLT Slope , which resulted in a significant mediation ( see text for more details ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 22978 . 010 Since prior studies have noted increased Aβ accumulation over time in those with elevated baseline Aβ ( Villemagne et al . , 2011; Sojkova et al . , 2011 ) and because we previously found a relationship between baseline Aβ and activation ( Mormino et al . , 2012 ) , we analyzed the relationship between baseline PIB , hippocampal activation , and PIB slope to ensure that our effects on longitudinal Aβ accumulation were not being driven solely by elevated baseline Aβ . To determine whether increased baseline amyloid levels led to increased baseline hippocampal activation , which led to greater longitudinal Aβ accumulation , we conducted a mediation analysis , with age , sex , and education as covariates . We found no evidence of mediation , as revealed by a 95% bootstrap confidence interval that included zero ( confidence interval: −0 . 004 to 0 . 044 ) . Thus , baseline amyloid levels did not lead to greater baseline hippocampal activation to influence longitudinal Aβ accumulation , suggesting the effect of hippocampal activation on Aβ accumulation does not solely rely on baseline amyloid levels . Furthermore , by including random intercepts into our linear mixed models , we accounted for initial differences in amyloid . We then conducted a moderation analysis using hierarchical linear regression to determine if baseline amyloid levels influenced Aβ accumulation , but depended on the level of hippocampal activation . The two predictors ( hippocampal activation and baseline PIB ) were first entered into the regression analysis to determine each predictor’s effect on PIB slope and then the interaction term was added . Results indicated that baseline hippocampal activation [b = −0 . 004 , p=0 . 034] but not baseline PIB [b = 2 . 01 , p=0 . 608] was associated with PIB slope and accounted for a significant amount of variance in PIB slope [R2 = 0 . 524 , F ( 6 , 20 ) = 3 . 67 , p=0 . 013] . The interaction between hippocampal activation and baseline PIB explained a significant increase in variance in PIB slope [ΔR2 = 0 . 15 , F ( 1 , 20 ) = 6 . 32 , p=0 . 021] . Thus , the influence of baseline amyloid levels on longitudinal Aβ accumulation depends on hippocampal activation at baseline . To further characterize the nature of this interaction , we used the Johnson-Neyman technique to identify at which point in the range of hippocampal activation contrast values where the effect of the predictor on the outcome transitions from being statistically significant to non-significant ( Hayes , 2013 ) . We found that when hippocampal activation was greater than or equal to a contrast value of 12 . 18 , higher baseline amyloid led to greater Aβ accumulation . This suggests that while baseline amyloid levels do not directly lead to greater levels of hippocampal activation , baseline amyloid’s relationship with Aβ accumulation may depend on higher levels of hippocampal activation at baseline . 3 Discussion In this study , we used fMRI with PIB-PET imaging and neuropsychological testing to investigate the influence of memory-related hippocampal activation at baseline on longitudinal Aβ accumulation and cognitive decline in normal older adults . While the amyloid hypothesis places Aβ deposition as the earliest event in a pathological cascade , why Aβ accumulates in the first place is not known . Although Aβ can induce structural and functional alterations to synapses and synaptic plasticity ( Selkoe , 2002; Almeida et al . , 2005; Coleman and Yao , 2003 ) , the reverse relationship also exists such that early synaptic activity can influence Aβ ( Nitsch et al . , 1993; Kamenetz et al . , 2003; Cirrito et al . , 2005; Bero et al . , 2011; Brody et al . , 2008 ) . A recent mouse model of AD found that hyperactivity of hippocampal neurons precedes Aβ plaque formation , suggesting that hippocampal hyperactivity is one of the earliest dysfunctions in the pathophysiological cascade of AD ( Busche and Konnerth , 2016 ) . This indicates that a major target of Aβ itself , synaptic activation , can control Aβ levels . These results support the hypothesis that increased hippocampal activation at baseline is associated with increased longitudinal Aβ accumulation across frontal , parietal , temporal , and cingulate cortices and that longitudinal Aβ accumulation mediates the effect of baseline hippocampal activation on memory decline . Although previous studies have shown that baseline PIB is associated with the rate of longitudinal amyloid accumulation ( Villemagne et al . , 2011; Sojkova et al . , 2011 ) , our results are not simply dependent on baseline PIB for several reasons . First , we included random slopes and random intercepts in our linear mixed models to account for baseline PIB and different PIB slopes for each participant . Second , we performed a mediation analysis to determine if baseline PIB acted through baseline hippocampal activation to lead to increased longitudinal Aβ accumulation , which was revealed not to be the case . Finally , a moderation analysis showed that baseline PIB predicted increased longitudinal Aβ accumulation , but only when baseline hippocampal activation was high . These data suggest that while baseline amyloid may be linked to increased Aβ accumulation , this did not drive the relationships between baseline hippocampal activity and longitudinal Aβ accumulation . Previous studies have described increased brain activity in those at risk for AD in different regions: the dentate gyrus/CA3 region of the hippocampus ( Bakker et al . , 2012; Yassa , 2011 ) , the entire hippocampus ( Mormino et al . , 2012; Dickerson et al . , 2005 ) , the MTL more broadly ( Dickerson et al . , 2004 ) , or neocortex ( Mormino et al . , 2012; Elman et al . , 2014; Jones et al . , 2016; Myers et al . , 2014 ) . These studies suggest that increased activation during memory performance is linked to risk for AD in older adults with memory impairment , MCI , ApoE4+ , or those who are Aβ+ . Our data support a role for task-related brain activation in the hippocampus that is linked to global Aβ deposition . Indeed , we found that only hippocampal activation at baseline and not non-hippocampal cortical activation was linked to increased longitudinal Aβ accumulation , suggesting regional specificity in these relationships . The regional pattern of relationships between cortical activation , hippocampal activation , and AD-related pathology may appear perplexing . Cross-sectional neuropathological data suggest that Aβ is first deposited in the cortex and then spreads to the MTL ( Thal et al . , 2002 ) , while tau deposition in the form of neurofibrillary tangles deposit in the MTL initially with later spread to neocortex ( Braak and Braak , 1995 ) . We find that activation in the hippocampus predicts cortical Aβ while cortical activation does not . There are a few possible explanations for this . Hippocampal hyperactivity may be more indicative of pathological effects in those at risk for AD , while cortical activation may reflect other processes . For example , we previously reported that increased cortical activity , but not hippocampal activity appeared to be compensatory during memory encoding ( Elman et al . , 2014 ) . This is consistent with data associating increased hippocampal activation with memory deficits ( Yassa et al . , 2011 ) , and with the findings that reversing hippocampal hyperactivity rescues memory deficits ( Bakker et al . , 2012 , 2015 ) . Another possibility is that increased hippocampal activation is driving neuronal activity elsewhere , in cortical regions such as retrosplenial cortex and precuneus with strong hippocampal connectivity and early Aβ deposition . Another possibility is that hippocampal activation is driving tau deposition in the MTL , which then leads to Aβ deposition . In fact , preclinical data suggest a crucial role for tau accumulation in producing aberrant neural hyperactivity ( Roberson et al . , 2011 ) . These possibilities are not mutually exclusive and will be important to examine in the future . This study has several limitations . Not all subjects had the same number of PIB scans ( each subject had two or three scans ) , which may influence the accuracy of PIB slope , however , linear mixed models are equipped to handle missing data . We found that there was no significant difference in PIB slope between participants with two or three scans or a relationship between years followed and PIB slope ( p’s > 0 . 05 ) . Sample size was relatively small and we did not have a large enough number of subjects to fully examine sex or ApoE4 carrier differences adequately . Absence of association may be due to lack of power rather than absence of a relationship , such as the absence of ApoE4 effect and absence of mediation through baseline Aβ . However , to determine if the effects of hippocampal activity on amyloid accumulation was driven by ApoE4 carriers , we removed them from the sample and re-ran the linear mixed model only in ApoE4 non-carriers . We found the interaction between hippocampal activation and amyloid accumulation remained significant [p = 0 . 018] . Thus , it appears the effect of hippocampal activation on increased amyloid accumulation is not specific to those who are ApoE4 carriers , but is also occurring in ApoE4 non-carriers that are also accumulating amyloid . Another limitation of the study ignores the role of tau in producing these effects . As tau PET imaging is still relatively novel , future studies can incorporate tau into these models to determine if hippocampal activation at baseline influences longitudinal Aβ accumulation alone or if it influences how Aβ and tau interact during the progression of AD . It will also be important to include longitudinal fMRI data in addition to longitudinal PIB-PET data to measure how longitudinal change in hippocampal activation tracks longitudinal Aβ accumulation . One would expect that as hippocampal activation decreases over time ( Celone et al . , 2006; O'Brien et al . , 2004 ) , increases in Aβ accumulation will taper off , as this would indicate later stages of AD . In fact , data suggest that late in disease stage , Aβ deposition slows or even reverses , consistent with the idea that declining brain activity affects late-stage Aβ deposition ( Villemagne et al . , 2011; Jack et al . , 2013 ) . While we find that baseline amyloid levels did not drive our findings of hippocampal activation in predicting Aβ accumulation , it will be important for future studies to track those with little baseline amyloid deposition to determine if they eventually display a pattern of increased hippocampal activity followed by increased amyloid deposition . 4 Materials and methods Forty-five normal older adults ( N = 45 ) underwent PIB-PET imaging , fMRI , and neuropsychological testing for this study . Subjects participated in an fMRI experiment of memory , the results of which have been published ( Mormino et al . , 2012 ) . From this sample , we included subjects who had ( 1 ) participated in the fMRI experiment , ( 2 ) at least two PIB scans , and ( 3 ) three neuropsychological testing sessions . All met the following inclusion criteria: no MRI contradictions , living independently in the community , MMSE ≥26 , within age , education , and gender norms on cognitive tests , absence of neurological or psychiatric illness , and lack of major medical illnesses and medications that affect cognition . Fifteen of the 45 subjects did not return for follow-up PIB-PET imaging , so they were not included in the current study . Three additional subjects were excluded due to problems with their PIB-PET data ( one had too much gray matter atrophy to accurately measure PIB , one had incomplete acquisition on their follow-up PIB scan , and one was greater than 3 . 5 standard deviations above the mean for non-hippocampal activation ) . This left us with a sample of 27 subjects who met the criteria for the study ( see Table 1 for demographics ) . The California Verbal Learning Test was administered to each participant as part of a larger battery of tests used at an annual evaluation carried out by the Berkeley Aging Cohort Study ( BACS ) . Participants received a neuropsychological evaluation within three months of participating in the fMRI study . Every subject had three neuropsychological testing sessions included for this study ( average time since MRI = 2 . 7 years ) . The neuropsychological battery was designed to examine memory function , as well as other aspects of general cognitive ability . The CVLT is a standardized memory test that was developed to assess a variety of memory processes and assesses rate of learning , retention after short- and long-delay intervals , semantic encoding ability , and recognition memory . We chose to focus on the CVLT Long-Delay Free Recall component of the test ( out of 16 ) , as this has been shown to be sensitive to cognitive decline and episodic memory deficits with age ( Lange et al . , 2002; Delis et al . , 1991 ) . Participants’ DNA from blood samples was analyzed for apolipoprotein E ( ApoE ) polymorphisms using a standard protocol . For statistical comparison between groups , subjects were dichotomized into carriers and non-carriers of the E4 allele ( see Table 1 for more details ) . PIB was synthesized at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory’s ( LBNL ) Biomedical Isotope Facility using a published protocol and described in detail previously ( Mormino et al . , 2012; Mathis et al . , 2003 ) . PIB-PET imaging was performed at LBNL using an ECAT EXACT HR or BIOGRAPH Truepoint six scanner ( Siemens Medical Systems , Erlangen , Germany ) in three dimensional acquisition mode . Ten to fifteen mCi of PIB was injected into an antecubital vein . Dynamic acquisition frames were obtained as follows: 4 × 15 , 8 × 30 , 9 × 60 , 2 × 180 , 8 × 300 , and 3 × 600 s ( 90 min total ) . Ten-minute transmission scans for attenuation correction or X-ray CT were obtained for each PIB scan . Data were corrected for motion and reconstructed with an iterative ordered subset expectation maximization algorithm with weighted attenuation . Images were smoothed with a 4 mm Gaussian kernel with scatter correction . All PIB-PET data were preprocessed using SPM12 software ( http://www . fil . ion . ucl . ac . uk/spm/ ) . The first five minutes of data were summed and then a two-pass realignment was performed . All scans were realigned to the summed first five minutes followed and then created of a mean of all those images followed by realigning everything to that mean . PET images were then co-registered to each subject’s structural MRI ( which were repeated near the time of each PET scan ) . PIB DVR images were created using Logan graphical analysis with frames corresponding to 35–90 min after injection and a cerebellar gray matter reference region defined using FreeSurfer version 5 . 3 . Mean DVR values from frontal , parietal , temporal , and cingulate cortices were computed to serve as a global PIB index for all subjects . All subjects were scanned on the ECAT HR for their first PIB scan , four subjects were scanned on the BIOGRAPH for their second scan ( the rest on the ECAT HR ) and eight subjects were scanned on the BIOGRAPH if they had a third PIB scan . There were no significant effects of scanner type in any of the linear mixed models and we have previously shown PIB measurement on these different scanners to be equivalent ( Elman et al . , 2014 ) . The following MRI acquisition parameters were previously reported ( Mormino et al . , 2012 ) . All subjects underwent MRI scanning at LBNL on a 1 . 5T Magnetom Avanto System ( Siemens Medical Systems ) with a 12-channel head coil run in triple mode . A high-resolution structural T1-weighted volumetric magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo scan ( MP-RAGE , axially acquired , time repetition [TR]/time echo [TE]/time to inversion [TI] = 2110/3 . 58/1100 ms , flip angle = 15° , 1 . 00 × 1 . 00 mm2 in plane resolution , 1 . 00 mm thickness with 50% gap ) and a low-resolution structural T1-weighted in plane to the fMRI scans were collected ( axially acquired , TR/TE = 591/10/10 ms , flip angle = 150° , 0 . 90 × 0 . 90 mm2 in plane resolution , 3 . 40 mm thickness with 15% gap ) . For fMRI scanning , 4 T2*-weighted gradient-echo echo planar images ( EPI ) were collected ( 28 axially acquired slices , TR/TE = 2200/50 ms , flip angle = 90° , 3 . 40 × 3 . 40 mm2 in plane resolution , 3 . 40 mm thickness with 15% gap ) . Two hundred images of natural outdoor scenes were presented for 4 . 4 s each . Subjects were instructed to indicate whether water was present in each image . Scans were broken into four sessions , with 50 scenes and 185 TRs per session . Zero to 5 TRs of fixation ( green crosshair on black background ) were randomly intermixed between scenes to allow separation of individual trials ( average inter-stimulus interval = 3 . 46 s ) . After the scan , a surprise recognition task including all stimuli presented during encoding as well as 100 novel stimuli ( foils ) was used to assess performance and sort fMRI data . There was a 15 min delay between the last stimulus encoded and the start of the memory test . For each image , subjects were asked if they had seen the image before and were allowed to respond with 1 of 4 responses: high-confidence yes , low-confidence yes , high-confidence no , and low-confidence no . The task was self-paced and subjects were encouraged to be as accurate as possible . For the current study , we examined task activation ( mean contrast values: hits > misses ) from task-positive regions of interest ( ROIs ) , which included the right hippocampus , bilateral occipital cortex , and bilateral inferior frontal gyrus , as described in Mormino et al . ( 2012 ) . MP-RAGE scans were processed using FreeSurfer version 5 . 3 ( https://surfer . nmr . mgh . harvard . edu ) to derive ROIs in each subject’s native space . Detailed task results and fMRI processing have been reported previously ( Mormino et al . , 2012 ) . All statistical analyses of behavioral variables and ROI activation means were conducted in SPSS v . 24 ( IBM Corp . , Armonk , NY ) . We conducted a series of linear mixed models . All models included age , sex , and education as covariates , as well as a random intercept to account for individual variability in initial PIB DVR or CVLT scores and random slopes to account for individual variability in PIB DVR or CVLT slopes . We also employed an autoregressive covariance structure to account for correlations between consecutive PIB DVR or CVLT values over time . Initial models also included ApoE4 carrier ( +/− ) and scanner type ( ECAT HR , BIOGRAPH ) as covariates , but effects were not significant so we removed them to simplify the model . Age was mean-centered at 76 . 5 years , education was mean-centered at 17 . 4 years , and females were the reference group , so that resulting parameter estimates could be interpreted as representing an example 76 . 5-year-old female with 17 . 4 years of education . While PIB and CVLT were both time-varying measurements , we did not have the statistical power to include both as time-varying measurements in our mixed effects model testing change in PIB predicting change in memory performance over time , since visits did not coincide in many cases , making modeling with a single time challenging . We therefore used PIB slope as an alternative , but note that this is a limitation as it does not precisely capture PIB change relative to CVLT change . Mediation and moderation analyses were conducted in SPSS using the PROCESS module ( Hayes , 2013 ) . For mediation analysis , unstandardized indirect effects were computed for each of 1000 bootstrapped samples , and the 95% confidence interval was computed . For the mediation model , Step 1 tested the effect of X on Y , not including M . Step 2 tested X predicting M , and Steps 3 and 4 tested M|X significant predictor of Y and X|M not a significant predictor of Y . For moderation analysis , the module employs hierarchical regression analysis to first test the relationships between the predictor and the outcome and the moderator and the outcome ( conditional effects ) and to then test the interaction between the predictor and the moderator ( i . e . how the effect of the predictor on the outcome changes as the moderator changes ) . Furthermore , it provides data to probe the interaction further by determining where in the distribution of the moderator the predictor is related to the outcome to better discern the interpretation of the interaction ( i . e . Johnson-Neyman technique ) . Statistical values were considered significant at a final alpha level of . 05 to prevent Type I error inflation ."}
{"doi": "elife-65228-v2", "abstract": "Drug addiction develops due to brain-wide plasticity within neuronal ensembles , mediated by dynamic gene expression . Though the most common approach to identify such ensembles relies on immediate early gene expression , little is known of how the activity of these genes is linked to modified behavior observed following repeated drug exposure . To address this gap , we present a broad-to-specific approach , beginning with a comprehensive investigation of brain-wide cocaine-driven gene expression , through the description of dynamic spatial patterns of gene induction in subregions of the striatum , and finally address functionality of region-specific gene induction in the development of cocaine preference . Our findings reveal differential cell-type specific dynamic transcriptional recruitment patterns within two subdomains of the dorsal striatum following repeated cocaine exposure . Furthermore , we demonstrate that induction of the IEG Egr2 in the ventrolateral striatum , as well as the cells within which it is expressed , are required for the development of cocaine seeking .", "plain language summary": "The human brain is ever changing , constantly rewiring itself in response to new experiences , knowledge or information from the environment . Addictive drugs such as cocaine can hijack the genetic mechanisms responsible for this plasticity , creating dangerous , obsessive drug-seeking and consuming behaviors . Cocaine-induced plasticity is difficult to apprehend , however , as brain regions or even cell populations can react differently to the compound . For instance , sub-regions in the striatum – the brain area that responds to rewards and helps to plan movement – show distinct responses during progressive exposure to cocaine . And while researchers know that the drug immediately changes how neurons switch certain genes on and off , it is still unclear how these genetic modifications later affect behavior . Mukherjee , Gonzales et al . explored these questions at different scales , first focusing on how progressive cocaine exposure changed the way various gene programs were activated across the entire brain . This revealed that programs in the striatum were the most affected by the drug . Examining this region more closely showed that cocaine switches on genes in specific ‘spiny projection’ neuron populations , depending on where these cells are located and the drug history of the mouse . Finally , Mukherjee , Gonzales et al . used genetically modified mice to piece together cocaine exposure , genetic changes and modifications in behavior . These experiments revealed that the drive to seek cocaine depended on activation of the Egr2 gene in populations of spiny projection neurons in a specific sub-region of the striatum . The gene , which codes for a protein that regulates how genes are switched on and off , was itself strongly activated by cocaine intake . Cocaine addiction can have devastating consequences for individuals . Grasping how this drug alters the brain could pave the way for new treatments , while also providing information on the basic mechanisms underlying brain plasticity .", "article": "1 Introduction Psychostimulant addiction is characterized by life-long behavioral abnormalities , driven by circuit-specific modulation of gene expression ( Nestler , 2014; Nestler and Lüscher , 2019; Salery et al . , 2020; Steiner , 2016 ) . Induction of immediate-early gene ( IEG ) transcription in the nucleus accumbens ( NAc ) and dorsal striatum ( DS ) are hallmarks of psychostimulant exposure ( Berke et al . , 1998; Caprioli et al . , 2017; Chandra and Lobo , 2017; Gao et al . , 2017b; Gerfen , 2000; Gonzales et al . , 2020; Guez-Barber et al . , 2011; Hope et al . , 1994; Moratalla et al . , 1996; Mukherjee et al . , 2018; Nestler et al . , 1993; Nestler , 2001; Nestler and Aghajanian , 1997; Piechota et al . , 2010; Turm et al . , 2014 ) . As such , IEG induction has been utilized to support the identification of functional neuronal assemblies mediating the development of cocaine-elicited behaviors ( ‘cocaine ensembles’; Bobadilla et al . , 2020; Cruz et al . , 2013 ) . Within these striatal structures , the principal neuronal type is the spiny projection neuron ( SPN ) , which is comprised of two competing subtypes , defined by their differential expression of dopamine receptors . Expression of the D1R dopamine receptor is found on direct-pathway neurons , responsible for action selection by promoting behavioral responses , while D2R-expressing indirect pathway neurons are responsible for action selection through behavioral inhibition ( Kreitzer and Malenka , 2008; Lipton et al . , 2019 ) . In the striatum , the cellular composition of cocaine ensembles varies by domain: Fos-expressing cocaine ensembles in the NAc are enriched for D1R expression ( Koya et al . , 2009 ) , while in the DS , IEG expression and psychostimulant-responsive ensembles are spatially segregated to the medial striatum ( MS ) and ventrolateral striatum ( VLS ) , encompassing both D1R+ and D2R+ neurons in the MS , and enriched for D1R expression in the VLS ( Caprioli et al . , 2017; Cruz et al . , 2015; Gonzales et al . , 2020; Li et al . , 2015; Rubio et al . , 2015; Steiner and Gerfen , 1993 ) . The VLS subregion partially overlaps with a lateral striatum segment enriched for Gpr155 expression , defined in recent molecular striatal subdivisions ( Märtin et al . , 2019; Ortiz et al . , 2020 ) . Depending on the history of prior cocaine exposure , a unique pattern of IEG induction is observed across brain structures ( Mukherjee et al . , 2018 ) . This transcriptional code was characterized addressing a handful of transcripts within bulk tissue , warranting a comprehensive study of the induced gene expression programs across key structures of the reward circuitry . Here we comprehensively describe gene programs in progressive stages of cocaine experience across multiple brain structures , analyze the spatial and cell-type-specific patterns of IEG expression within prominently recruited brain regions , and functionally link induced gene expression to the development of cocaine preference . Taking an unbiased approach to the identification of the cellular and molecular modifications underlying the development of cocaine-elicited behaviors , we analyzed dynamics of cocaine-induced transcription across five structures of the reward circuitry . Of these , the most prominently induced gene programs were in the DS . Addressing the spatial segregation of these transcriptional programs within the DS ( studying 759 , 551 individual cells by multiplexed single-molecule fluorescence in-situ hybridization ) , we investigated the dynamics of cell-specific recruitment within the two striatal subdomains engaged by cocaine , the MS and VLS . While both D1R+ and D2R+ neurons in the MS were engaged transcriptionally throughout the development of cocaine sensitization , the recruitment of D1R+ neurons in the VLS fluctuated depending on the history of cocaine exposure . The IEG Egr2 , which we find to be the most robustly induced following cocaine experience , serves as a prominent marker for these VLS ensembles . We therefore addressed the function of VLS Egr2+ ensembles , as well the role of VLS expressed Egr2-transcriptional complexes , in the development of cocaine seeking . Our results identify the VLS as a hub of dynamic transcriptional recruitment by cocaine and define a role for Egr2-dependent transcriptional regulation in VLS D1R+ neurons in the development of cocaine seeking . 2 Results In order to characterize brain-wide gene expression programs corresponding to the development of psychostimulant sensitization , we exposed mice to cocaine ( 20 mg/kg , i . p . ) acutely , or repeatedly ( five daily exposures ) , as well as to a cocaine challenge ( acute exposure following 21 days of abstinence from repeated exposure to cocaine ) ( Figure 1A ) . We then profiled transcription ( applying 3′-RNA-seq ) within key brain structures of the reward circuitry ( limbic cortex = LCtx , nucleus accumbens = NAc , dorsal striatum = DS , amygdala = Amy , lateral hypothalamus = LH; see Figure 1—figure supplement 1 for the delineation of brain tissue dissected; Supplementary file 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 2 for a description of the samples sequenced ) at 0 ( not exposed to cocaine on day of sample collection ) , 1 , 2 or 4 hr post-cocaine exposure ( Figure 1A ) . Mice exhibited increased locomotion upon acute exposure to cocaine , further increasing following repeated exposure and maintained after abstinence and challenge re-exposure , typical of locomotor sensitization to this intermediate cocaine dose ( Figure 1B , F8 , 312 = 178 . 9 , p<0 . 0001 , ANOVA ) . Experience impacts gene transcription at multiple timescales ( Clayton et al . , 2020; Mukherjee et al . , 2018; Nestler and Lüscher , 2019; Rittschof and Hughes , 2018; Sinha et al . , 2020; Yap and Greenberg , 2018 ) . Whereas the expression of inducible genes peak and decay on a time scale of minutes-to-hours following stimulation , baseline shifts in brain-wide gene expression programs are also observed following more prolonged periods ( days to weeks ) ( Clayton et al . , 2020 ) , presumably implementing , supporting , and maintaining the modified behavioral output ( Sinha et al . , 2020 ) . We initially focused on baseline shifts in gene expression , comparing naïve mice ( never exposed to cocaine ) to mice exposed repeatedly to cocaine , as well as to mice following 21 days of abstinence from repeated cocaine exposure ( Figure 1C; Figure 1—figure supplement 3A; refer to Supplementary file 2 for list of differentially expressed genes and normalized counts ) . Differentially expressed genes ( DEGs ) included both upregulated and downregulated genes across all brain regions analyzed , with prolonged abstinence driving the most extreme shifts in expression ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3B , C ) . While gene-expression shifts following repeated exposure to cocaine were prominent in the DS , abstinence-induced changes were more prominent in the NAc and LCtx ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3C ) . KEGG analysis demonstrated that DEGs were enriched for synaptic genes and disease pathways ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3D ) . To provide insight into the cellular mechanisms affected by repeated drug exposure and abstinence , we implemented Gene Ontology ( GO term ) enrichment analysis ( Figure 1C , Figure 1—figure supplement 4 , see Supplementary file 3 for definition of clusters and DEGs included within them ) . Gene clusters associated with synaptic plasticity , myelin , and proteostasis demonstrated shifts in expression across multiple brain structures , whereas a cluster of genes associated with structural plasticity appeared more specific to striatal structures ( DS and NAc ) . Noteworthy gene clusters that displayed modified expression were involved in cell–cell communication; glutamate-induced plasticity; synaptic vesicle formation , transport , and fusion; actin filament components; and projection morphogenesis . Notably , the expression of protein folding genes was coordinately upregulated across structures , while myelin components were coordinately downregulated ( Figure 1—figure supplement 4 ) . These results exemplify the dramatic shifts of transcription occurring in the brain in response to repeated cocaine exposure , potentially supporting maladaptive neuroplasticity driving drug addiction ( Bannon et al . , 2014; Lull et al . , 2008 ) . Inducible transcription supports the development of plastic changes following psychostimulant experience ( Alberini , 2009; Han et al . , 2019; McClung and Nestler , 2008; Nestler and Lüscher , 2019 ) . We therefore assessed the inducible transcription response at 1 , 2 , or 4 hr following acute , repeated , or challenge cocaine exposure , observing robust IEG induction across all brain structures studied ( Figure 1D ) . The largest number of induced genes , as well as the highest fold induction levels , were found in the DS ( Figure 1D , E; refer to Supplementary file 4 for the identities of genes induced in each structure and cocaine condition ) . To what extent do the transcription programs induced in the different structures share common attributes ? To query the overlap in the identity of genes induced and their temporal induction patterns following the different schedules of cocaine exposure , we graphed the induced genes , color coding them according to their time of peak induction ( 1 , 2 , or 4 hr following cocaine ) ( Figure 1F ) . Thus , for example , if a gene was commonly induced across structures with a peak at 1 hr across cocaine regimens , this would be evident as a contiguous vertical green line . This graph reveals aspects of the logic of these inducible transcription programs , whereby ( 1 ) genes induced following the different cocaine schedules largely maintain the same temporal structure , i . e . , if the peak induction of a given gene was observed at a defined time point in one program , its peak induction time was maintained across other programs; ( 2 ) following repeated cocaine exposure , we observe a substantial dampening of the transcriptional response in the DS , which recovers following cocaine challenge , recapitulating a significant proportion of the acute cocaine gene program; ( 3 ) all gene programs largely represent subcomponents of the program induced by acute cocaine in the DS . We further visualized the overlap in the identity of genes induced in the different structures using Venn diagrams ( Figure 1G ) , illustrating that the overlap stems principally from the immediate component of the transcriptional program ( peaking at 1 hr following cocaine ) , while transcripts induced at 2 or 4 hr following cocaine diverged between structures . Focusing on the most robust programs , induced in the DS , we found that gene clusters enriched at the 1 hr time points are related primarily to transcriptional regulation and synapse-to-nucleus signal transduction , while clusters related to modification of neural morphology and function were enriched at later time points ( Figure 1H; refer to Supplementary file 5 ) . Taken together , these results highlight robust transcriptional adaptations in the DS , positioning it as a major hub of cocaine-induced plasticity . Furthermore , our results illustrate the utilization of a conserved set of genes during the early wave of transcription following experience , followed by divergence of subsequent transcription , possibly to support region-specific mechanisms of plasticity ( Hrvatin et al . , 2018; Walker et al . , 2018 ) . Our observation of dynamic transcriptional responses to repeated cocaine exposure in the DS ( Figure 1 ) motivated us to address the cellular and spatial distribution of this transcriptional plasticity . Recently , using single-molecule fluorescence in-situ hybridization ( smFISH ) , we reported region-specific rules governing the recruitment of striatal assemblies following a single acute exposure to cocaine ( Gonzales et al . , 2020 ) . We now revisited this spatial analysis , applying smFISH to expand the investigation of the striatal distribution of the IEGs Arc , Egr2 , Fos , and Nr4a1 throughout the development of cocaine sensitization ( Figure 2; Figure 2—figure supplements 1 and 2; results from Gonzales et al . , 2020 serve as a reference for the effects of acute cocaine exposure ) . Addressing an overview of induced expression of these IEGs , we observed robust induction of Arc , Egr2 , Nr4a1 , and Fos following acute cocaine exposure , which was dampened following repeated exposure to cocaine and reinstated following a challenge dose of cocaine , in-line with the results described in Figure 1 ( Figure 2A–C ) . To visualize the subdomains defined by IEG expressing cells , we applied 2D kernel density estimation on striatal sections following repeated and challenge cocaine and compared resulting patterns to those previously described following acute cocaine exposure ( Gonzales et al . , 2020 ) . The prominent recruitment of IEG expression in the VLS observed following acute cocaine exposure was dampened drastically after repeated cocaine exposure , and re-emerged upon cocaine challenge . In contrast to the findings in the VLS , dampening of IEG induction in the MS , while evident , was more modest ( Figure 2D ) . These results are quantified in Figure 2E , F . In the VLS , the fraction of robustly expressing cells of Egr2 increased to 46 ± 10% after acute cocaine , decreased to 21 ± 4% following repeated cocaine , and subsequently increased to 40 ± 11% upon cocaine challenge . Similar dynamics were observed for Fos , where the fractions of suprathreshold cells were observed to be 37 ± 10% , 21 ± 4% , and 34 ± 7% following acute , repeated , and challenge cocaine , respectively . In contrast , in the MS , the fraction of cells expressing Egr2 and Fos increased to 42 ± 8% and 40 ± 7% after acute cocaine , modestly decreased to 33 ± 3% and 35 ± 3% after repeated cocaine , and regained elevated induction of 43 ± 4% and 40 ± 4% following challenge cocaine ( Figure 2E [mean ± SD]; Egr2 VLS F2 , 66 = 21 . 4 , p<0 . 0001; Fos VLS F2 , 30 = 4 . 9964 , p=0 . 01; Egr2 MS F2 , 66 = 6 . 4 , p=0 . 002; Fos MS F2 , 30 = 3 . 1 , p=0 . 06; ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test; for detailed statistics refer to Supplementary file 6 ) . With reference to expression levels , acute , repeated , and challenge cocaine-mediated puncta/cell expression in the VLS was observed to be 11 . 9 ± 3 . 8 , 3 . 9 ± 0 . 8 , 9 . 5 ± 3 . 4 for Egr2 and 6 . 8 ± 2 . 3 , 3 . 5 ± 0 . 5 , 5 . 9 ± 1 . 6 for Fos , respectively . Comparing these to the MS , the expression levels were observed to be 9 . 2 ± 2 . 2 , 6 . 5 ± 1 . 0 , and 9 . 5 ± 1 . 2 for Egr2 and 7 . 4 ± 1 . 5 , 6 ± 0 . 8 , and 7 . 5 ± 1 . 3 for Fos after acute , repeated , and challenge , respectively ( Figure 2F ) ( mean ± SD; Egr2 VLS F2 , 66 = 21 . 7 , p<0 . 0001; Fos VLS F2 , 30 = 4 . 9 , p=0 . 01; Egr2 MS F2 , 66 = 9 . 01 , p=0 . 0003; Fos MS F2 , 30 = 3 . 4 , p=0 . 04; ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test; for detailed statistics refer to Supplementary file 6 ) . A similar trend was evident for the expression of Arc and Nr4a1 in the VLS vs . the MS ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1A , B ) . Notably , the expression of different IEGs was highly correlated within individual cells , defining overlapping populations of neurons responsive to the cocaine experiences studied . Once recruited by cocaine , neurons committed to co-expression of multiple IEGs to virtually identical levels ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2; for detailed statistics , see Supplementary file 6 ) . These data demonstrate the coherent co-expression of multiple IEGs within striatal assemblies during the development of behavioral sensitization to cocaine , likely to support mechanisms of long-term plasticity within these ensembles . In sum , the history of cocaine experience is reflected in the differential transcriptional recruitment of striatal subdomains , dampening drastically in the VLS following repeated exposure . Striatal Drd1+-neurons are implicated in promoting actions , while Drd2+-neurons are implicated in the tempering and refinement of action selection ( Bariselli et al . , 2019 ) . Differential IEG induction in Drd1+ vs Drd2+ expressing SPN ensembles is expected to shed light on the relative contribution of plasticity within each cell type to the development of cocaine behaviors . We have previously reported that acute exposure to cocaine induces Egr2 expression in both Drd1+ and Drd2+ neurons in the MS , while more selectively inducing Egr2 expression in Drd1+-neurons in the VLS ( Gonzales et al . , 2020 ) . Extending this analysis to repeated and challenge cocaine exposures and with additional IEGs , we observed robust dampening of the induction of Egr2 and Fos in VLS Drd1+ neurons following repeated exposure to cocaine , while upon cocaine challenge , prominent induction was again evident , especially in Drd1 SPNs . ( Figure 3A–C , Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) . In contrast , in the MS , subtle dampening was observed and Egr2 and Fos expression maintained consistent correlation to Drd1 and Drd2 expression throughout acute , repeated , and challenge cocaine exposures ( Figure 3C , Figure 3—figure supplement 1; for reference of Drd1 and Drd2 levels in MS and VLS , see Figure 3—figure supplement 2 , Supplementary file 6 for statistics ) . Thus , the observed attenuated transcriptional recruitment in the DS can be attributed to selective dampening of IEG induction , primarily within VLS Drd1+ neurons . This specialization in transcriptional plasticity likely underlies differential roles of the striatal subregions and cells within them in supporting behavioral modification induced by cocaine experience . The greater enrichment of Egr2 induction within VLS neurons suggests a causal role for this neuronal population in supporting cocaine conditioned behaviors . To address the role of VLS Egr2+ neurons in cocaine seeking , we bilaterally injected Cre-dependent inhibitory hM4Di DREADD ( VLS-Egr2hM4Di ) , targeting the VLS of Egr2-Cre knock-in mice . In these mice , an Egr2 allele is substituted for Cre ( Voiculescu et al . , 2000 ) , supporting the expression of Cre recombinase in neurons expressing Egr2 . DREADD hM4Di-mediated selective inhibition of the VLS Egr2-expressing neuronal ensembles was achieved by administration of clozapine-N-oxide ( CNO ) ( Atlan et al . , 2018; Terem et al . , 2020 ) . Control mice were either transduced with viruses expressing hM4Di , similar to the experimental group , and exposed to saline ( Figure 3E ) or transduced with viruses conditionally expressing mCherry and exposed to CNO ( Figure 3G , for expression domains , see Figure 3F , Figure 3—figure supplement 3A , B ) . In an initial experiment , we transduced two groups of mice with AAV-DIO-hM4Di to the VLS . Three weeks later , we ran a cocaine conditioned-place preference ( CPP ) experiment , in which mice were conditioned over three alternate days to a cocaine-associated context , while on the day following each conditioning session their side preference was tested ( conditioning – days 2 , 4 , 6; tests – days 1 , 3 , 5 , 7; Figure 3D , ‘Design 1’ ) . In control mice expressing hM4Di and exposed to saline prior to cocaine conditioning sessions , CPP developed following a single conditioning session and was reinforced following additional conditioning sessions ( Figure 3E ) . The experimental group , which was exposed to CNO ( 5 mg/kg; i . p . ) 30 min prior to cocaine conditioning , also displayed CPP following the initial exposure; however , in this group , the preference decayed with additional conditioning , such that following the third conditioning session , CPP in this group was significantly different from the control group ( preference score saline vs . CNO Test3: p<0 . 05 , t = 2 , df = 8 . 6; one-tailed t-test; Figure 3E ) . We interpret these results as suggesting that the first cocaine conditioning session induced expression of Cre within VLS Egr2+ neurons , supporting the accumulation of functional hM4Di within these neurons to a CNO-responsive complement by the third conditioning session , resulting in diminished conditioned-place preference . In a subsequent experiment , we implemented conditioning to the cocaine-associated context for three consecutive days prior to performing a preference test and exposed both experimental ( hM4Di-expressing ) and control ( mCherry-expressing ) groups to CNO ( 10 mg/kg; i . p . ) prior to cocaine conditioning session ( Figure 3D , ‘Design 2’ ) . We found that both groups demonstrated CPP ( Figure 3G; paired t-test on % time spent on drug paired side; pVLS-Egr2mCherry < 0 . 00001 , t = −11 . 362 , df = 6; pVLS-Egr2hM4Di < 0 . 003 , t = −4 . 1232 , df = 6 ) . However , mice in which VLS Egr2+ neurons were inhibited ( VLS-Egr2hM4Di ) displayed lower preference for the drug paired context ( preference score ) compared to control mice ( VLS-Egr2mCherry ) ( Figure 3G; p<0 . 05 , t = 1 . 95 , df = 9 . 4 , one-tailed t-test ) . Importantly , no differences in locomotion were observed between groups on conditioning or test days ( p=0 . 93 , F4 , 48 = 0 . 19 , ANOVA; Figure 3—figure supplement 3C ) . We therefore conclude that VLS Egr2+-expressing neurons contribute to the development of cocaine-seeking behavior , with no obvious impact on locomotor aspects of cocaine-driven behavior . Salient experiences in general , and specifically exposure to cocaine , are thought to modify future behavior through induced gene expression responses , leading to stable changes in cell and circuit function ( Nestler and Lüscher , 2019; Robison and Nestler , 2011 ) . We hypothesized that the induction of Egr2 by cocaine within VLS neurons may play a causal role in cocaine-induced modification of behavior . To assess a potential link between the expression of Egr2 and cellular plasticity responsible for such behavioral modification , we ran an additional CPP experiment , following bilateral viral transduction of the VLS neurons with AAV-eGFP ( VLSGFP ) , or a dominant-negative ( S382R , D383Y ) isoform of Egr2 ( VLSDNEgr2; Figure 3H , Figure 3—figure supplement 4A , B ) . The dominant-negative mutation disrupts the DNA-binding activity of Egr2 , while not interfering with the capacity of the protein to form heteromeric complexes with its natural binding partners , effectively inhibiting transcriptional activation of downstream genes regulated by Egr2 ( LeBlanc et al . , 2007; Nagarajan et al . , 2001 ) . Comparing the development of cocaine CPP , we found that both groups of mice developed CPP ( Figure 3I , paired t-test on % time spent on drug paired side; pVLS-GFP <0 . 001 , t = −4 . 9782 , df = 7; pVLS-DNEgr2 <0 . 05 , t = −2 . 2199 , df = 7 ) . However , VLSDNEgr2 developed lower CPP than VLSGFP mice ( Figure 3I , p<0 . 05 , t = 2 . 36 , df = 14 , unpaired t-test ) . No differences in locomotion were observed between the groups of mice ( p=0 . 7 , F4 , 56 = 0 . 54 , ANOVA; Figure 3—figure supplement 4C ) . These results assign a functional role to Egr2 induction , primarily within VLS Drd1+ neurons , in the development of conditioned-place preference to cocaine . To test the effect of disrupting Egr2 complexes may have on transcription , we analyzed the expression of Arc , Egr2 , and Nr4a1 in the VLS , MS , NAc , and LCtx . In the VLS , we observed the anticipated overexpression of Egr2 ( Figure 3—figure supplement 4D , p ( Egr2 ) <0 . 05 , t = −5 . 3616 , df = 2; two-tailed t-test , reflecting exogenous expression of the mutant gene ) , as well as blunted Arc and Nr4a1 expression ( Figure 3—figure supplement 4D , p ( Arc ) <0 . 01 , t = 6 , df = 2 . 8; p ( Nr4a1 ) <0 . 005 , t = 6 . 2 , df = 3 . 8; two-tailed t-test ) . We did not observe any clear differences in gene expression between groups within other structures , demonstrating the localized effect of our viral manipulation ( Figure 3—figure supplement 4E–G ) . These results demonstrate a role for cocaine-induced expression of Egr2 in the VLS in supporting the development of cocaine-seeking and suggest that inducible transcriptional complexes involving Egr2 are functional in facilitating drug-induced maladaptive plasticity . 3 Discussion Drugs of abuse such as cocaine are known to act on key brain circuits , modifying and biasing the future behavior of an individual toward increased drug seeking . In this study , we develop a comprehensive compendium of the transcriptional dynamics induced within key brain regions during the development of cocaine sensitization . We highlight the striatum as a major hub of plasticity , within which we identify differential transcriptional recruitment of neuronal ensembles by cocaine , dependent on striatal subdomain , identity of projection neurons and the history of cocaine exposure . Finally , we focus on a prominent cocaine-sensitive IEG , Egr2 , and show that Egr2-expressing SPNs in the VLS , and the expression of Egr2 within them , support drug-seeking behavior . Repeated exposure to cocaine , as well as abstinence , produces long-lasting functional changes in the reward circuit to drive the maladaptive modification of reinforced behavior ( Dong and Nestler , 2014; Everitt , 2014; Gremel and Lovinger , 2017; Hyman et al . , 2006; Kelley , 2004; Lüscher , 2016; Lüscher and Malenka , 2011; Nestler , 2013; Russo and Nestler , 2013; Salery et al . , 2020; Volkow and Morales , 2015; Wolf , 2016; Zahm et al . , 2010 ) . The imprinting of such potentially lifelong alterations in behavior driven by drug experience is supported by cocaine-induced modifications in gene expression ( McClung and Nestler , 2008; Nestler , 2002; Nestler and Lüscher , 2019; Salery et al . , 2020; Steiner , 2016; Steiner and Van Waes , 2013 ) . In this study , using an unbiased approach to screen gene expression , we resolved the transcriptional landscapes of distinct cocaine experiences across multiple reward-related brain circuits with broad temporal resolution . Our approach allowed us to describe transcripts modulated at updated baselines ( after a history of either repeated cocaine exposure or abstinence ) , as well as in the hours following exposure to distinct cocaine experiences . Baseline transcriptional changes in cortical and basal ganglia structures following defined cocaine schedules have been described previously in both rodents and humans ( Bannon et al . , 2005; Bannon et al . , 2014; Eipper-Mains et al . , 2013; Freeman et al . , 2010; Gao et al . , 2017a; Hurd and Herkenham , 1993; Lull et al . , 2008; Ribeiro et al . , 2017; Walker et al . , 2018 ) . Consistent with previous findings , we observed dynamic shifts in baseline gene expression in multiple categories potentially associated with neuronal plasticity ( synaptic genes; genes associated with projection morphogenesis , actin filament regulation; proteostasis and myelin ) . Interestingly , genes associated with neuronal morphology and synaptic function demonstrated unique patterns of shifts within different brain structures . For example , expression of genes such as Vamp , Pkrcg , Ncdn , Camk2b , Shank3 , and Syp were downregulated in the NAc following repeated cocaine exposure , while being upregulated in the DS . Such region-specific shifts in gene expression may support circuit-specific structural and functional modifications to cell assemblies ( Clayton et al . , 2020; Kyrke-Smith and Williams , 2018 ) . Myelin genes ( Plp1 , Mobp , Mbp , Mal , Pllp ) were downregulated across all structures studied ( LCtx , Amy , NAc , DS , LH ) , initially following repeated cocaine exposure , and further following abstinence , across all experimental mice . Conversely , genes associated with proteostasis ( e . g . , chaperones such as members of the CCT , Hsp40 , Hsp70 , and Hsp90 complexes ) were upregulated in concert across structures following cocaine abstinence . Notably , similar changes in myelin genes and genes associated with proteostasis have been described in both human and rodent studies ( Albertson et al . , 2004; Bannon et al . , 2014; García-Fuster et al . , 2012; Johnson et al . , 2012; Kovalevich et al . , 2012; Lull et al . , 2008; Narayana et al . , 2014 ) , but their functional implications remain unknown . Future investigation into the features of cocaine experience-related transcriptome is anticipated to provide targets for intervention , potentially supporting the reversal of brain function to a ‘cocaine-naive’ state . IEG expression is well accepted to be the substrate for long-term modulations supporting memory formation ( Alberini , 2009; Alberini and Kandel , 2015 ) . Although cocaine-induced IEG expression has been extensively characterized in rodents ( Berke et al . , 1998; Caster and Kuhn , 2009; Gao et al . , 2017a; Guez-Barber et al . , 2011; Moratalla et al . , 1996; Piechota et al . , 2010; Robison and Nestler , 2011; Savell et al . , 2020; Steiner , 2016; Valjent et al . , 2006; Zahm et al . , 2010 ) , these studies were mostly limited in the number of genes analyzed and restricted to isolated brain structures following specific drug regimens . Addressing the cocaine-induced transcriptome , we observed transcriptional recruitment of the LCtx , Amy , NAc , and DS , of which the DS was most prominent . Furthermore , the immediate-early transcriptional programs induced across other tissues largely consisted of subcomponents of DS programs . What does this imply ? We propose thathe overlapping fraction of induced genes is representative of a ‘core transcriptome’ that is consistently induced across many structures or cell types and only varies in the magnitude of their expression ( Hrvatin et al . , 2018; Savell et al . , 2020; Tyssowski et al . , 2018 ) . This core component predominantly corresponds to signaling molecules and transcriptional regulators ( the genes common across most programs are Arc , Arl4d , Btg2 , Ddit4 , Dusp1 , Egr2 , Egr4 , Fos , Fosb , Junb , Nr4a1 , Per1 , and Tiparp ) , likely responsible for transforming inducing signals into instructions for implementation of appropriate synaptic , cellular , and circuit-specific plasticity mechanisms by ‘effector’ genes . These downstream effector genes are induced in a secondary wave of transcription , corresponding to the significantly diversified gene response at 2–4 hr following cocaine ( Amit et al . , 2007; Clayton et al . , 2020; Gray and Spiegel , 2019; Hrvatin et al . , 2018; Mukherjee et al . , 2018; Tyssowski et al . , 2018; Yap and Greenberg , 2018 ) . Interestingly , a recent landmark study ( Savell et al . , 2020 ) utilized a multiplexed CRISPR strategy to drive co-expression of genes overlapping with many of the components of the putative ‘core transcriptome’ ( Btg2 , Egr2 , Egr4 , Fos , FosB , JunB , and Nr4a1 ) in the NAc and found that this manipulation increased SPN excitability and enhanced the development of cocaine sensitization . What might be the role of the transcriptional induction in the DS and its subsequent dampening ? It is becoming more broadly accepted that IEG induction serves to support long-term plasticity ( Chandra and Lobo , 2017; Clayton , 2000; Clayton et al . , 2020; Mukherjee et al . , 2018; Tyssowski and Gray , 2019 ) . The MS is defined as the ‘associative striatum’ and is associated with goal-directed behaviors , as well as defining the vigor of locomotor actions ( Balleine and O'Doherty , 2010; Balleine and Ostlund , 2007; Kravitz et al . , 2010; Lipton et al . , 2019; Nonomura et al . , 2018 ) . We propose that the cocaine-driven locomotor sensitization may be mediated by the balanced and largely maintained transcriptional induction within Drd1/Drd2 SPNs in the MS . The lateral ‘sensori-motor’ striatum is strongly associated with habit formation and compulsive drug seeking ( Lipton et al . , 2019; Yin et al . , 2004; Zapata et al . , 2010 ) . Moreover , the VLS receives selective sensorimotor afferents mapped to upper limb and orofacial cortical regions . Interestingly , behavioral stereotypies , primarily upper limb and orofacial , arise upon high-dose psychostimulant exposure ( Karler et al . , 1994; Murray et al . , 2015; Schlussman et al . , 2003 ) , and orofacial stereotypies have been induced following selective infusion of psychostimulants to the VLS ( Baker et al . , 1998; Delfs and Kelley , 1990; Rebec et al . , 1997; White et al . , 1998 ) . It is intriguing to consider the possibility that recruitment of plasticity mechanisms within VLS Drd1+ neurons supports the increased propensity to engage in orofacial stereotypies , while the subsequent dampening of cocaine-induced transcription within these neurons may indicate the ‘canalization’ of this limited action repertoire , at the expense of a broader behavioral repertoire . This topic will form the basis for future investigation . Infusion of psychostimulants into the VLS has also been shown to promote operant reinforcement and conditioned-place preference , implicating it in reward and reinforcement ( Baker et al . , 1998; Kelley and Delfs , 1991 ) . In order to query the role of the VLS IEG-expressing ensembles in the development of cocaine context association , we inhibited the activity of VLS Egr2+ neurons by conditional expression of hM4Di DREADDs , which curbed CPP . To directly investigate a role for VLS IEG induction on CPP behavior , we expressed a dominant-negative isoform of Egr2 ( in which the DNA-binding domain was inactivated ) in the VLS and observed a similar impact . Thus , to our knowledge , we provide the first functional implication of the VLS in cocaine seeking . Furthermore , we describe cellular dynamics of transcriptional recruitment of VLS IEG+ neurons ( primarily Drd1+ ) during the development of behavioral sensitization to cocaine . The development and execution of drug-seeking behavior is heavily context dependent ( Calipari et al . , 2016; Crombag et al . , 2002; Crombag et al . , 2008; Crombag and Shaham , 2002; Cruz et al . , 2014; Lee et al . , 2006; Rubio et al . , 2015 ) . Potentially , the dampening of sensorimotor VLS IEG induction following repeated cocaine could serve to ‘cement’ the initial context association , limiting behavioral flexibility and the capacity to revert context association , exacerbating the impact of contextual cues on drug seeking behavior ( Calipari et al . , 2016; Crombag and Shaham , 2002; Gipson et al . , 2013; Hyman , 2005; Phillips et al . , 2003; Shaham et al . , 2003; Volkow et al . , 2006 ) . Recently , we have shown that salient experiences are represented in the mouse brain by unique patterns of gene expression . Thus , the induction pattern of a handful of genes is sufficient to decode the recent experience of individual mice with almost absolute certainty . Of these , the IEG whose expression contributes most towards classification of the recent experience of individual mice is Egr2 ( Mukherjee et al . , 2018 ) . Egr2 is , furthermore , the gene most robustly induced by cocaine in the dorsal striatum ( Gonzales et al . , 2020; Mukherjee et al . , 2018; Supplementary file 4 ) and is a sensitive indicator of cocaine-engaged striatal cell assemblies ( Gonzales et al . , 2020 ) . In the current study , we initiated investigation into the role of Egr2 in promoting drug seeking . Previous studies have shown that Egr2 is crucial for normal hindbrain development , peripheral myelination , and humoral immune response and is implicated in diseases such as congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy , Charcot–Marie-Tooth disease , Dejerine–Sottas syndrome , as well as schizophrenia ( Boerkoel et al . , 2001; De and Turman , 2005; Li et al . , 2019; Morita et al . , 2016; Okamura et al . , 2015; Svaren and Meijer , 2008; Topilko et al . , 1994; Warner et al . , 1999; Warner et al . , 1998; Wilkinson , 1995; Yamada et al . , 2007 ) . In the central nervous system , Egr2 has been shown to be induced by seizure activity , kainic acid injection , LTP-inducing stimuli in hippocampal neurons , as well as following administration of several groups of drugs such as methamphetamine , cocaine , heroin , and alcohol ( Gao et al . , 2017a; Gass et al . , 1994; Imperio et al . , 2018; López-López et al . , 2017; Mataga et al . , 2001; Rakhade et al . , 2007; Saint-Preux et al . , 2013; Worley et al . , 1993 ) . However , the role Egr2 may play in encoding memory or drug-induced behavior remained unresolved . Our findings show that the activity of Egr2 is required for the full development of cocaine place preference , and highlight an additional member of the Egr family , alongside Egr1 and Egr3 , in drug-induced plasticity ( Bannon et al . , 2014; Chandra et al . , 2015; Moratalla et al . , 1992; Valjent et al . , 2006 ) . Egr2 has been implicated in the regulation of cell-specific gene expression in peripheral Schwann cells ( Jang et al . , 2006 ) and fibroblasts ( Fang et al . , 2011 ) , and disruptions to Egr2 DNA binding have been implicated in diseases of myelination and brain development . However , we are not aware of any study identifying the targets of Egr2 in the mature brain . We report downregulated expression of Nr4a1 and Arc following overexpression of dominant-negative Egr2 in the VLS . However , as we did not identify Egr2 binding sites within regulatory regions of Nr4a1 or Arc , we hypothesize that the impact of DN-Egr2 expression on Nr4a1 and Arc may be indirect , a point for future investigation . In conclusion , our study provides ( 1 ) a comprehensive description of brain-wide transcriptional dynamics , as well as spatial dynamics of SPN-specific IEG recruitment during the development of cocaine sensitization and ( 2 ) a demonstration of the role of VLS Egr2-expressing ensembles , as well as VLS expression of Egr2 , in the development of cocaine seeking . Future work will address the mechanisms supporting cell-type specificity of transcriptional induction , as well as the role of IEG-mediated plasticity mechanisms in VLS-dependent stereotypy and context association . 4 Materials and methods Further information and requests for resources should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the Lead Contact , Ami Citri ( ami . citri@mail . huji . ac . il ) .

It can spot these threats because it recognizes certain signals at the surface of dangerous cells . However , cancer cells often find ways to ‘hide’ from our immune system . Chimeric antigen receptors , or CARs , are receptors designed in a laboratory to attach to specific proteins that are found on a cancer cell . These receptors tell immune cells , such as T cells , to attack cancers . T cells that carry CARs are already used to treat people with blood cancers . Yet , these immune cells are not good at penetrating a solid tumor to kill the cells inside , which limits their use . Macrophages are a group of immune cells that can make their way inside tumors and travel to cancers that the rest of the immune system cannot reach . They defend our body by ‘swallowing’ harmful cells . Would it then be possible to use CARs to program macrophages to ‘eat’ cancer cells ? Morrissey , Williamson et al . created a new type of CARs , named CAR-P , and introduced it in macrophages . These cells were then able to recognize and attack beads covered in proteins found on cancer cells . The modified macrophages could also limit the growth of live cancer cells in a dish by ‘biting’ and even ‘eating’ them . While these results are promising in the laboratory , the next step is to test whether these reprogrammed macrophages can recognize and fight cancers in living animals .", "article": "1 Introduction Chimeric antigen receptors ( CARs ) are synthetic transmembrane receptors that redirect T cell activity towards clinically relevant targets ( reviewed in [Lim et al . , 2017; Fesnak et al . , 2016] ) . The CAR-T receptor contains an extracellular single chain antibody fragment ( scFv ) that recognizes known tumor antigens , and intracellular signaling domains from the T Cell Receptor ( TCR ) and costimulatory molecules that trigger T cell activation ( Fesnak et al . , 2016; Kochenderfer et al . , 2009 ) . CAR-T cells recognizing CD19 , a marker expressed at high levels on the surface of B cells and B cell-derived malignancies , have been used successfully to target hematological malignancies with 70–90% of patients showing measurable improvement ( Lim et al . , 2017; Engel et al . , 1995; Haso et al . , 2013 ) . The success of CAR-T suggests that programming immune cells to target cancer might be a broadly applicable approach . Macrophages are critical effectors of the innate immune system , responsible for engulfing debris and pathogens . Harnessing macrophages to combat tumor growth is of longstanding interest ( Alvey and Discher , 2017; Lee et al . , 2016 ) . Macrophages are uniquely capable of penetrating solid tumors , while other immune cells , like T cells , are physically excluded or inactivated ( Lim et al . , 2017; Lee et al . , 2016 ) . This suggests that engineered macrophages may augment existing T cell-based therapies . Early efforts transferring healthy macrophages into cancer patients failed to inhibit tumor growth , suggesting that macrophages require additional signals to direct their activity towards tumors ( Lacerna et al . , 1988; Andreesen et al . , 1990 ) . Antibody blockade of CD47 , a negative regulator of phagocytosis , reduced tumor burden , indicating that shifting the balance in favor of macrophage activation and engulfment is a promising therapeutic avenue ( Majeti et al . , 2009; Chao et al . , 2010; Jaiswal et al . , 2009; Tseng et al . , 2013 ) . Here , we report a family of chimeric antigen receptors that activate phagocytosis of cancer cells based on recognition of defined cell surface markers , resulting in significantly reduced cancer cell growth . 2 Results To program engulfment towards a target antigen , we created a CAR strategy using the CAR-T design as a guide ( Fesnak et al . , 2016 ) . We call this new class of synthetic receptors Chimeric Antigen Receptors for Phagocytosis ( CAR-Ps ) . The CAR-P molecules contain the extracellular single-chain antibody variable fragment ( scFv ) recognizing the B cell antigen CD19 ( ɑCD19 ) and the CD8 transmembrane domain present in the ɑCD19 CAR-T ( Fesnak et al . , 2016; Kochenderfer et al . , 2009 ) . To identify cytoplasmic domains capable of promoting phagocytosis , we screened a library of known murine phagocytic receptors: Megf10 ( Figure 1a ) , the common ɣ subunit of Fc receptors ( FcRɣ ) , Bai1 , and MerTK ( Penberthy and Ravichandran , 2016 ) . FcR triggers engulfment of antibody-bound particles , while the other receptors recognize apoptotic corpses ( Freeman and Grinstein , 2014; Penberthy and Ravichandran , 2016 ) . We also made a receptor containing an extracellular ɑCD19 antibody fragment and a cytoplasmic GFP , but no signaling domain , to test whether adhesion mediated by the ɑCD19 antibody fragment is sufficient to induce engulfment ( Figure 1a; CAR-PGFP ) . To assay our library of CAR-Ps , we introduced each CAR-P into J774A . 1 murine macrophages by lentiviral infection . As an engulfment target , we used 5 µm diameter silica beads coated with a supported lipid bilayer . A His8-tagged extracellular domain of CD19 was bound to a NiNTA-lipid incorporated into the supported lipid bilayers . Macrophages expressing a CAR-P with the Megf10 ( CAR-PMegf10 ) or FcRɣ ( CAR-PFcRɣ ) intracellular domain promoted significant engulfment of CD19 beads compared to macrophages with no CAR ( Figure 1b , c , Figure 1—video 1 ) . Macrophages expressing CAR-PBai1 , CAR-PMerTK , and the adhesion-only CAR-PGFP did not bind the CD19 beads even though these CAR-Ps are present at the cell surface ( Figure 1b , c , Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . To confirm that the CAR-P was a viable strategy for redirecting primary macrophages , we expressed the CAR-PFcRɣ in primary murine bone marrow derived macrophages and found that these transfected primary cells also were able to trigger engulfment of CD19 beads ( Figure 1d ) . Next we asked if the CAR-P strategy could target a different antigen . Because CAR-PMegf10 performed well in our initial screen ( Figure 1a ) , we developed ɑCD22 CAR-PMegf10 using a previously developed ɑCD22 antibody fragment ( Xiao et al . , 2009; Haso et al . , 2013 ) . Consistent with our results using ɑCD19-based CARs , ɑCD22 CAR-PMegf10 promoted engulfment of CD22 beads ( Figure 2a ) . To confirm antigen specificity of CAR-P , we incubated ɑCD19 CAR-PMegf10 macrophages with CD22 beads , and ɑCD22 CAR-PMegf10 macrophages with CD19 beads . CD19 beads were not eaten by ɑCD22 CAR-PMegf10 macrophages , and CD22 beads were not eaten by ɑCD19 CAR-PMegf10 macrophages ( Figure 2a ) . These data indicate that CAR-PMegf10 specifically triggers engulfment in response to the target ligand and that the CAR-P strategy is able to target multiple cancer antigens . To further define the capabilities of the CAR-P , we assessed the capacity of CAR-P-expressing macrophages to engulf variably sized targets . We found that CAR-PMegf10 was able to trigger specific engulfment of beads ranging from 2 . 5 µm to 20 µm in diameter , with higher specificity above background engulfment being demonstrated for the larger beads ( Figure 2b ) . The high background in this assay is due to heterogeneity in the bilayers on beads purchased from a different manufacturer ( Corpuscular ) than previous assays . For the 10 µm bead condition , we also tested the phagocytic efficiency of beads containing the endogenous Megf10 ligand , phosphatidylserine . We found that CAR-PMegf10 macrophages engulfed CD19 beads and beads containing 10% phosphatidylserine and the adhesion molecule ICAM-1 at a similar frequency ( Figure 2b ) . This indicates that the CAR-P is comparably efficient to the endogenous system . To determine if the CAR-PMegf10 initiates active signaling at the synapse between the macrophage and target , we stained for phosphotyrosine . Macrophages expressing CAR-PMegf10 exhibited an increase in phosphotyrosine at the synapse , while macrophages expressing CAR-PGFP did not show this enrichment ( Figure 3a ) . Consistent with previous reports , we found that F-actin also was enriched at the cell bead synapse ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) . This result suggests that CAR-PMegf10 initiates engulfment through a localized signaling cascade involving tyrosine phosphorylation . Both successful CAR-P intracellular domains ( from FcRɣ and Megf10 ) have cytosolic Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-based Activation Motifs ( ITAMs ) that are phosphorylated by Src family kinases . Based on this observation , we hypothesized that the expression of an alternate ITAM-containing receptor might initiate phagocytosis when expressed in macrophages . The CD3ζ subunit of the T cell receptor contains three ITAM motifs . To test if the CD3ζ chain was able to activate phagocytic signaling , we transduced macrophages with the first generation CAR-T ( Figure 3b ) . The CAR-T was able to trigger engulfment of CD19 beads to a comparable extent as CAR-PMegf10 ( Figure 3c ) . In T cells , phosphorylated ITAMs in CD3ζ bind to tandem SH2 domains ( tSH2 ) in the kinase ZAP70 . Zap70 is not expressed in macrophages , but Syk , a phagocytic signaling effector and tSH2 domain containing protein , is expressed at high levels ( Andreu et al . , 2017 ) . Previous work suggested that Syk kinase can also bind to the CD3ζ ITAMs ( Bu et al . , 1995 ) , indicating that the CAR-T may promote engulfment through a similar mechanism as CAR-PFcRɣ . To quantitatively compare the interaction between SyktSH2 and CD3ζ or FcRɣ in a membrane proximal system recapitulating physiological geometry , we a used liposome-based assay ( Figure 3d [Hui and Vale , 2014] ) . In this system , His10-CD3ζ and His10-Lck ( the kinase that phosphorylates CD3ζ ) are bound to a liposome via NiNTA-lipids and the binding of labeled tandem SH2 domains to phosphorylated CD3ζ was measured using fluorescence quenching . Our results show that Syk-tSH2 binds the CD3ζ and FcRɣ with comparable affinity ( ~15 nM and ~30 nM respectively , Figure 3d ) . Collectively , these results demonstrate that the TCR CD3ζ chain can promote phagocytosis in a CAR-P , likely through the recruitment of Syk kinase . We next sought to program engulfment towards a cellular target . We incubated the CAR-PMegf10 and CAR-PFcRɣ macrophages with cancerous Raji B cells that express high levels of endogenous CD19 . Strikingly , the majority of CAR-P-expressing macrophages internalized bites of the target cell ( Figure 4a , Figure 4—video 1 , 78% of CAR-PMegf10 and 85% of CAR-PFcRɣ macrophages internalized bites within 90 min ) . The biting phenotype resembles trogocytosis , or nibbling of live cells , which has been reported previously in immune cells ( Joly and Hudrisier , 2003 ) . This process was dependent on the ITAM-bearing intracellular signaling domain , as removing the signaling domain ( CAR-PGFP ) dramatically reduced trogocytosis ( Figure 4a ) . Enrichment of phosphotyrosine at the cell-cell synapse further supports active signaling initiating trogocytosis ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) . The CAR-P module also was able to induce trogocytosis in non-professional phagocytes , human NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2 ) . This suggests that the CAR-P can promote cancer antigen-dependent engulfment by both professional and non-professional phagocytes . We next focused on engineering strategies to engulf whole human cancer cells . We observed that macrophages expressing the CAR-PMegf10 or CAR-PFcRɣ were capable of engulfing whole Raji B cells ( 2 cancer cells eaten per 100 macrophages in a 4–8 hr window for both CAR-PMegf10 or CAR-PFcRɣ , Figure 4b , e , Figure 4—video 2 ) . Whole cell engulfment was infrequent but trogocytosis was robust , suggesting that productive macrophage target interactions were frequently insufficient to trigger whole cell engulfment . To determine if whole cell eating could be enhanced by further opsonization of CD19 , we opsonized Raji B cells with a mouse IgG2a anti-CD19 antibody . While addition of this antibody did not trigger additional whole cell internalization , blockade of the ‘don’t eat me’ signal CD47 using the mouse IgG1 anti-human B6H12 clone resulted in a 2 . 5 fold increase of whole cell eating of opsonized Raji B cells ( Figure 4—figure supplement 3 ) . Both endogenous FcR recognition of the anti-CD47 antibody and blockade of CD47 signaling may contribute to this effect . To develop a receptor to enhance whole cell eating , we hypothesized that combining signaling motifs in a tandem array might increase the frequency of whole cell engulfment by specifically recruiting effectors required for the engulfment of large targets . Previous work demonstrated that PI3K signaling is important for internalization of large targets ( Schlam et al . , 2015 ) . To increase PI3K recruitment to the CAR-P , we fused the portion of the CD19 cytoplasmic domain ( amino acids 500 to 534 ) that recruits the p85 subunit of PI3K to the CAR-PFcRɣ creating a ‘tandem’ CAR ( CAR-Ptandem , Figure 4c ) ( Tuveson et al . , 1993; Brooks et al . , 2004 ) . A CAR-P containing the p85 recruitment motif alone ( CAR-PPI3K ) was able to induce some whole cell engulfment , comparable to the CAR-PFcRɣ ( Figure 4e ) . Expression of CAR-Ptandem tripled the ability of macrophages to ingest whole cells compared to CAR-PGFP ( 6 cancer cells eaten per 100 macrophages , Figure 4d , e , Figure 4—video 3 ) . These data indicate that assembling an array of motifs designed to recruit distinct phagocytic effectors can increase CAR-P activity towards whole cells . To determine if the combination of whole cell eating and trogocytosis was sufficient to drive a noticeable reduction in cancer cell number , we incubated CAR-P macrophages with Raji B cells for two days . After 44 hr of co-culture , we found that CAR-P macrophages significantly reduced the number of Raji cells ( Figure 4f ) . Although the CAR-Ptandem was much more efficient at whole cell eating , the CAR-PFcRɣ performed nearly as well at eliminating Rajis . Importantly , our assay does not distinguish between whole cell engulfment or death following trogocytosis , so it is possible both CAR-P activities are contributing to Raji death rates . Overall , these data suggest that the CAR-P is a successful strategy for directing macrophages towards cancer targets , and can initiate whole cell eating and trogocytosis leading to cancer cell elimination . In summary , we engineered phagocytes that recognize and ingest targets through specific antibody-mediated interactions . This strategy can be directed towards multiple extracellular ligands ( CD19 and CD22 ) and can be used with several intracellular signaling domains that contain ITAM motifs ( Megf10 , FcRɣ , and CD3ζ ) . Previous work has suggested that spatial segregation between Src-family kinases and an inhibitory phosphatase , driven by receptor ligation , is sufficient to trigger signaling by the T cell receptor ( Davis and van der Merwe , 2006; James and Vale , 2012 ) and FcR ( Freeman et al . , 2016 ) . The CAR-Ps that we have developed may similarly convert receptor-ligand binding into receptor phosphorylation of ITAM domains through partitioning of kinases and phosphatases at the membrane-membrane interface . Further development of CAR-Ps could be useful on several therapeutic fronts . Targeting of tumor cells by macrophages has been suggested to cause tumor cell killing ( Jaiswal et al . , 2009; Majeti et al . , 2009; Chao et al . , 2010; Jadus et al . , 1996 ) , either through directly engulfing cancer cells or by stimulating antigen presentation and a T cell-mediated response ( Liu et al . , 2015; Tseng et al . , 2013 ) . Inhibition of the CD47-SIRPA ‘Don’t eat me’ signaling pathway has also been shown to result in engulfment of cancer cells ( Chen et al . , 2017; Gardai et al . , 2005; Jaiswal et al . , 2009; Majeti et al . , 2009; Chao et al . , 2010 ) . A recent study suggests that CD47 inhibition is most effective when combined with a positive signal to promote target engulfment , which raises the possibility of combining CAR-P expression with CD47 or SIRPA inhibition for an additive effect ( Alvey et al . , 2017 ) . Although we were able to increase whole cell engulfment by recruiting the activating subunit of PI3K to the phagocytic synapse , the engulfment of larger 20 micron beads was more frequent than the engulfment of whole cells . We hypothesize that this is due to differing physical properties of the engulfment target . Specifically , increased target stiffness has been shown to promote engulfment , suggesting that manipulating the physical properties of the engulfment target could also be a potential strategy for increasing CAR-P efficiency ( Beningo and Wang , 2002; Cross et al . , 2007 ) . While the CAR-P can engulf whole , viable cancer cells , the ingestion of a piece of the target cell is more common . Trogocytosis , or nibbling of living cells , has also been described in immune cells ( Harshyne et al . , 2003; Harshyne et al . , 2001; Kao et al . , 2006; Joly and Hudrisier , 2003; Batista et al . , 2001 ) and brain-eating amoebae ( Ralston et al . , 2014 ) . In vivo studies also have shown that endogenous dendritic cell populations ingest bites of live tumor cells , contributing to presentation of cancer neo-antigen ( Harshyne et al . , 2001; Harshyne et al . , 2003 ) . Although we were able to use the CAR-P to induce trogocytosis in dendritic cells , we were not able to detect robust cross presentation of the model antigen ovalbumin ( Figure 4—figure supplement 4 ) . Thus , although using CAR-Ps to enhance cross presentation of cancer antigen is an intriguing future avenue , such a strategy would likely require more optimization of the dendritic cell subset employed or the CAR-P receptor itself . Overall , our study demonstrates that the CAR approach is transferrable to biological processes beyond T cell activation and that the expression of an engineered receptor in phagocytic cells is sufficient to promote specific engulfment and elimination of cancer cells . 3 Materials and methods Detailed information for all constructs can be found in the Key resources table .

J774A . 1 macrophages and NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were obtained from the UCSF cell culture facility and cultured in DMEM ( Gibco , Catalog #11965–092 ) supplemented with 1 x Pen-Strep-Glutamine ( Corning , Catalog #30–009 Cl ) and 10% fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) ( Atlanta Biologicals , Catalog #S11150H ) . Raji B cells were obtained from J . Blau ( McManus lab , UCSF ) and cultured in RPMI ( Gibco , Catalog #11875–093 ) supplemented with 1 x Pen-Strep-Glutamine ( Corning , Catalog #30–009 Cl ) , 10% FBS ( Atlanta Biologicals , Catalog #S11150H ) , 10 mM HEPES ( Gibco , Catalog #1530080 ) , and 5 µM 2-Mercaptoethanol ( Sigma , Catalog #M6250-100mL ) . All cell lines used in this study were tested for Mycoplasma at least once per month using the Lonza MycoAlert Detection Kit ( Lonza , Catalog# LT07-318 ) and control set ( Lonza , Catalog #LT07-518 ) . Lentiviral infection was used to stably express CAR-P constructs in all cell types . Lentivirus was produced by HEK293T cells transfected with pMD2 . G ( a gift from Didier Tronon , Addgene plasmid # 12259 containing the VSV-G envelope protein ) , pCMV-dR8 . 91 ( since replaced by second generation compatible pCMV-dR8 . 2 , Addgene plasmid #8455 ) , and a lentiviral backbone vector containing the construct of interest ( derived from pHRSIN-CSGW ) using lipofectamine LTX ( Invitrogen , Catalog # 15338–100 ) . The media on the HEK293T cells was replaced with fresh media 8–16 hr post transfection to remove transfection reagent . At 50–72 hr post-transfection , the lentiviral media was filtered with a 0 . 45 µm filter and concentrated by centrifugation at 8000 x g for 4 hr or overnight . The concentrated supernatant was applied directly to ~0 . 5×106 NIH 3T3 cells in 2 ml of fresh media . For J77A4 . 1 macrophages and Raji B cells , the concentrated supernatant was mixed with 2 mls of media and 2 µg lipofectamine ( Invitrogen , Catalog # 18324–012 ) and added to the cells . The cells were spun at 2200 x g for 45 min at 37°C . Cells were analyzed a minimum of 72 hr later . Chloroform-suspended lipids were mixed in the following molar ratio using clean glasstight Hamilton syringes ( Hamilton , Catalog #8 1100 ) : 97% POPC ( Avanti , Catalog # 850457 ) , 2% Ni2+-DGS-NTA ( Avanti , Catalog # 790404 ) , 0 . 5% PEG5000-PE ( Avanti , Catalog # 880230 , and 0 . 5% atto390-DOPE ( ATTO-TEC GmbH , Catalog # AD 390–161 ) . Lipid mixes were dried under argon and desiccated overnight under foil . Dried lipids were resuspended in 1 ml tissue-culture grade PBS , pH7 . 2 ( Gibco , Catalog # 20012050 ) , and stored under argon gas . Small unilamellar vesicles were formed by five freeze-thaw cycles followed by 2 × 5 min of bath sonication ( Bioruptor Pico , Diagenode ) , and cleared by ultracentrifugation ( TLA120 . 1 rotor , 35 , 000 rpm / 53 , 227 x g , 35 min , 4°C ) or by 33 freeze thaw cycles . Lipid mixes were used immediately for form bilayers or shock frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored under argon at −80°C . To form bilayers on silica beads , 6 × 108 5 µm silica microspheres ( 10% solids , Bangs Labs , Catalog # SS05N ) were washed 2x in water , and 2x in PBS by sequential suspension in water and spinning at 800 rcf , followed by decanting . Cleaned beads were resuspended in 150 µl tissue-culture grade PBS , pH7 . 2 ( Gibco , Catalog # 20012050 ) and briefly vortexed . 30 µl cleared SUVs prepared as above as a 10 mM stock were added to bead suspension for a 2 mM final SUV concentration . Beads were vortexed for 10 s , covered in foil , and rotated for 30 min at room temperature to form bilayers . Bilayer-coated beads were washed 3x in PBS by sequential centrifugation at 800 rcf and decanting . Beads were resuspended in PBS + 0 . 1% w/v BSA for blocking for 15 min rotating at room temperature under foil . 10 nM final concentration of CD19his8 ( Sino Biological , Catalog # 11880H08H50 ) or CD22his8 ( Sino Biological , Catalog # 11958H08H50 ) protein were added to blocked beads and proteins were allowed to bind during a 45 min incubation rotating under foil at room temperature . Beads were washed 3x in PBS + 0 . 1% w/v BSA by sequential centrifugation at 300 rcf and decanting . Beads were resuspended in 120 µl PBS + 0 . 1% w/v BSA . Prior building bilayers on Silica beads ranging from 2 . 5 µm-20 µm in diameter ( Microspheres-Nanospheres , Catalog# C-SIO-2 . 5 , 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 ) , beads were RCA cleaned as follows: beads were pelleted at 2000 x g in low retention tubes ( Eppendorf , Catalog #022431081 ) and resuspended in acetone . Resuspended beads were sonicated for 60 min in a bath sonicator . Rinse and sonication were repeated in ethanol . Finally , rinse and sonication were repeated in water . Beads were then washed 2x in water to remove all traces of ethanol and left in a small volume after decanting . All further steps were performed in a 70–80°C water bath prepared in a fume hood . Proper Personal Protective Equipment ( PPE ) was worn throughout the RCA cleaning protocol . Washed beads were added to 3 ml of hot 1 . 5 M KOH in a clean glass vial suspended in the water bath described above . 1 ml 30% H2O2 to bead solution and allowed to react for 10 min . Washed beads were cooled on ice , pelleted at 2000xg and rinsed 5x in ultrapure water . Used cleaning solution was saved for disposal by Environmental Health and Safety ( EH and S ) . Cleaned beads were resuspended in 240 µl tissue-culture grade PBS , pH7 . 2 ( Gibco , Catalog # 20012050 ) and briefly vortexed . The lipid mix used in this assay differed slightly from above . Here a mix of 93 . 5% POPC ( Avanti , Catalog # 850457 ) , 5% Ni2+-DGS-NTA ( Avanti , Catalog # 790404 ) , 1% PEG5000-PE ( Avanti , Catalog # 880230 , and 0 . 5% atto390-DOPE ( ATTO-TEC GmbH , Catalog # AD 390–161 . Bilayers were built and proteins coupled as described above . The concentration of CD19 was scaled appropriately to account for the increased surface area of the larger beads . 12 to 16 hr prior to imaging , 2 . 5 × 104 J774A . 1 macrophages expressing the appropriate CAR-P or control construct were plated in a 96-well glass bottom MatriPlate ( Brooks , Catalog # MGB096-1-2-LG-L ) . To assess engulfment , 0 . 5 × 106 CD19 or CD22-ligated beads were added to each well . Engulfment was allowed to proceed for 45 min at 37°C incubator with CO2 . Cells were then imaged as described below . On the day of imaging 0 . 5 × 106 NIH 3T3 fibroblasts , dendritic cells or macrophages and 1 . 5 million Raji B cells were combined in a 1 . 5 ml eppendorf tube and pelleted by centrifugation ( 800 rpm / 68 x g ) for 5 min at room temperature . Culture media was decanted to ~100 µl volume and cells were gently resuspended , and allowed to interact in the small volume for 60 min in a 37°C incubator with CO2 . After incubation cells and beads were diluted to a final volume of 1000 µl and 300 µl of this co-culture plated for imaging in a 96-well glass bottom MatriPlate ( Brooks , Catalog # MGB096-1-2-LG-L ) , and imaged as described below . 20 , 000 J774A . 1 macrophages were plated into 96-well glass bottom MatriPlate ( Brooks , Catalog # MGB096-1-2-LG-L ) in a final volume of 300 µl complete DMEM ( Gibco , Catalog #11965–092 ) supplemented with 1 x Pen-Strep-Glutamine ( Corning , Catalog #30–009 Cl ) and 10% fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) ( Atlanta Biologicals , Catalog #S11150H ) . 52 hr prior to reading the assay macrophages were stimulated with 500 ng/ml LPS ( Sigma , Catalog # L4516 ) . 44 hr prior to imaging LPS was removed by three sequential gentle washes . After LPS removal 10 , 000 Rajis expressing mCherry-CAAX were added to the well containing stimulated macrophages . The co-culture was incubated for 44 hr in a 37°C tissue culture incubator with 5% CO2 . After 44 hr , the remaining number of Raji B cells remaining was analyzed by FACS as follows: 10 , 000 counting beads were added to the well immediately prior to reading and the cell-counting bead mixture was harvested by pipetting up and down 8x with a p200 pipet . The assay was read on an LSRII ( BD Biosciences ) and Rajis were identified by the presence of mCherry fluorescence . Bone marrow derived macrophages ( BMDMs ) were produced as previously described ( Weischenfeldt and Porse , 2008 ) , except that L-929 conditioned media was replaced with purified 25 ng/ml M-CSF ( Peprotech , Catalog # 315–02 ) . The BMDMs were lentivirally infected with concentrated lentivirus after 5 days of differentiation . Differentiation was confirmed by F4/80 staining on day seven and found to be >95% efficient for each replicate . Phagocytosis was measured on day nine in imaging media lacking M-CSF . To produce CAR-P expressing dendritic cells , bone marrow-derived hematopoietic stem cells were lentivirally infected immediately after harvest by spinning with concentrated lentivirus in GMCSF-containing media ( IMDM supplemented with 10% FBS and PSG ) on retronectin ( Clontech , Catalog # T100A ) -coated plates at 2200 x g for 45 min at 37°C . Dendritic cells were produced as previously described ( Mayordomo et al . , 1995 ) by culturing bone marrow cells for 8–11 days with GMCSF . IL-4 was added 2–3 days before use . Efficient differentiation into CD11c + dendritic cells was verified by FACS , revealing ≥95% APC-CD11c + cells ( Biolegend , Catalog #N418 ) . The ability of CAR-P to stimulate OTI T cell proliferation was tested using the co-culture assay shown as a schematic in Figure 4—figure supplement 4 and described previously ( Roberts et al . , 2016 ) . 10 , 000 CAR-P transduced CD11c + dendritic cells transduced and differentiated as above were plated in U bottom 96 well dishes ( Falcon , Catalog #353077 ) and stimulated with 1 ug/ml LPS . 12 hr after LPS stimulation , 40 , 000 Raji B cells expressing soluble cytosolic ovalbumin ( Raji B-OVA ) were added to the culture . 24 hr after Raji B-OVA cell addition , 50 , 000 OTI CD8 + T cells isolated from lymph nodes of OTI TCR transgenic mice using a CD8 +T cell purification kit ( Stemcell , Catalog #19853 ) and labeled with e670 proliferation dye ( Thermo , Catalog #65-0840-85 ) were added . 72 hr after OTI addition the percent of OTI cells divided was measured by eFluor670 signal using flow cytometry . All imaging in this study was performed using a spinning disk confocal microscope with environmental control ( Nikon Ti-Eclipse inverted microscope with a Yokogawa spinning disk unit ) . For bead internalization assays , images were acquired using a 40 × 0 . 95 N/A air objective and unbiased live image acquisition was performed using the High Content Screening ( HCS ) Site Generator plugin in µManager3 . Other images were acquired using either a 100 × 1 . 49 N/A oil immersion objective . All images were acquired using an Andor iXon EM-CCD camera . The open source µManager software package was used to control the microscope and acquire all images3 . 20 , 000 J774A . 1 macrophages were plated into 96-well glass bottom MatriPlate ( Brooks , Catalog # MGB096-1-2-LG-L ) . Four hours prior to imaging , the macrophages were stimulated with 500 ng/ml LPS ( Sigma , Catalog # L4516 ) . Immediately prior to imaging the LPS-containing media was replaced with Fluobrite DMEM ( ThermoFisher Scientific , Catalog # A1896701 ) containing 10% FBS . 40 , 000 Raji cells were added to the macrophages and the co-culture was imaged at 5 min intervals for 12 hr . For the antibody experiments , macrophages were washed into DMEM minus phenol red ( A14430-01 ) containing 10% FBS just prior to addition of 40 , 000 Raji cells . Where indicated antibody was added to a final concentration of 20 µg/ml immediately after Raji cell addition and prior to imaging to limit antibody internalization . Because cells moved in and out of the field of view , we selected the cells present after 8 hr of imaging and quantified their B cell eating if they could be followed for four hours or more . Time-lapse analysis was essential to ensure that the B cell appeared viable prior to engulfment by the macrophage . Engulfment of B cells with an apoptotic morphology was not counted as a whole cell eating event . During live cell image acquisition GFP-positive J774A . 1 macrophages or NIH 3T3 cells were selected by the presence of GFP signal . A full z-stack comprising the entire cell was captured using 1 µm steps . All z sections were then manually inspected for internalized Raji B cell material . Cells containing one or more bites of fully internalized Raji B cell material >1 µm in diameter were scored as positive . Experiments were carried out as previously described2 . Briefly , proteins were purified using a bacterial expression system . All protein components ( 1 mg/ml BSA , 100 nM tSH2-Syk SNAP-505 , 0 to 500 nM His10-CD3ζ or His10-FcRɣ intracellular chain , and 7 . 2 nM His10-Lck Y505F ) were mixed into kinase buffer ( 50 mM HEPES-NaOH pH 6 . 8 , 150 mM NaCl , 10 mM MgCl2 , and 1 mM TCEP ) . Liposomes prepared at the following molar ratios: 74 . 5% POPC ( Avanti , Catalog # 850457C ) , 10% DOGS-NTA ( Nickel ) ( Avanti , Catalog # 790404C , 0 . 5% Rhodamine PE ( Avanti , Catalog # 810150C ) , and 15% DOPS ( Avanti , Catalog # 840035C ) were added and the mixture was incubated for 40–60 min at room temperature , during which the SNAP-505 fluorescence was monitored at 8 s intervals with 504 nm excitation and 540 nm emission . 1 mM ATP was then injected to trigger Lck mediated phosphorylation of CD3ζ or FcRɣ . Injection was followed by 5 s of automatic shaking of the plate , and the fluorescence was further monitored at 8 s intervals for at least 1 hr . Data were normalized by setting the average fluorescence value of the last 10 data points before ATP addition as 100% and background fluorescence as 0% . The final extent of fluorescence quenching ( % fluorescence change ) at each concentration of receptor was determined using the average of the last 20 data points after ensuring fully equilibrated binding . Nine reactions containing increasing concentrations of CD3ζ and nine reactions containing increasing concentrations of FcRɣ were run in parallel . The final % fluorescence change was plotted against FcRɣ or CD3ζ concentration . The apparent dissociation constants ( Kd ) of tSH2-Syk to FcRɣ and CD3ζ were calculated by fitting the data with Graphpad Prism 6 . 0 , using the ‘one site specific binding’ model . The intracellular portion of the FcR γ-chain ( aa 45–85 , Human FcRɣ , Uniprot FCERG_HUMAN ) was cloned into a modified pET28a vector containing a His10 upstream to the multiple cloning site using BamHI and EcoRI . The intracellular portion of CD3ζ ( aa 52–164 , Human CD3ζ , Uniprot CD3Z_HUMAN ) was also cloned into the His10 modified pET28a vector . A Lys-Cys-Lys-Lys sequence , originally present for fluorescent labeling , is also present between His10 and CD3ζ in this construct . SNAP-tSH2Syk ( aa 1–262 ) was cloned into a pGEX6 vector using BamHI and EcoRI . His10-CD3ζ , His10-FcR γ-chain , and GST-SNAP-tSH2Syk were bacterially expressed in BL21 ( DE3 ) RIPL strain of Escherichia coli as described previously2 . His10-Lck Y505F was expressed in SF9 cells using the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus system as described previously2 . All cells were lysed in an Avestin Emulsiflex system . His10 proteins were purified by using Ni-NTA agarose ( Qiagen , Catalog # 30230 ) and GST-SNAP-tSH2Syk was purified by using glutathione-Sepharose beads ( GE Healthcare , Catalog # 17075601 ) as described previously2 . Soluble SNAP-tSH2 Syk was generated by cleaving the GST moiety via the PreScission Protease at 4°C overnight . All proteins were subjected to gel-filtration chromatography using a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column ( GE Healthcare , Catalog # 17517501 ) in HEPES-buffered saline ( HBS ) containing 50 mM HEPES-NaOH ( pH 6 . 8 for His10-CD3ζ , His10-FcR γ-chain , and GST-SNAP-tSH2Syk and pH 7 . 4 for His10-Lck Y505F ) , 150 mM NaCl , 5% glycerol , and 1 mM TCEP . The monomer fractions were pooled , frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C . All gel-filtered proteins were quantified by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining , using BSA as a standard . To prepare fluorescently labeled tSH2 Syk , 10 uM SNAP-tSH2 Syk was incubated at a 1:2 ratio with SNAP-Cell 505-Star ( NEB , Catalog # S9103S ) overnight at 4°C and run over a PD MiniTrap G-25 ( GE Healthcare , Catalog # 28-9225-29 AB ) column to eliminate excess dye . To fix and stain preparations described above in bead and bites assays for quantifying enrichment of phosphotyrosine staining , half the media ( ~150 µl ) was gently removed from the imaging well and replaced with 150 µl 6 . 4% paraformaldehyde solution ( prepared from 32% stock , Electron Microscopy Sciences , Catalog # 50980495 ) in tissue culture grade PBS , pH7 . 2 ( Gibco , Catalog # 20012050 ) . Cells were fixed for 15 min in a 37°C incubator with CO2 . After fixation cells were washed 2x with PBS and permeabilized/blocked for 60 min at room temperature in freshly prepared , filter sterilized PBS + 5% FBS+0 . 1% w/v saponin ( PFS solution ) . After permeabilization , cells were washed 2 × 3 min with PFS solution . Following block , cells were incubated with 1:100 dilution of mouse anti-phosphotyrosine ( pTyr ) antibody to stain pan-pTyr ( Santa Cruz , Catalog # PY20 ) diluted in PFS solution in the dark for 60 min at room temperature then washed 3 × 5 min in PFS solution . Washed cells were incubated with a 1:500 dilution of goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 647 antibody ( Thermo/Molecular Probes , Catalog # A21236 ) in PFS solution in the dark for 60 min at room temperature . Wells were then washed 3 × 5 min in PFS solution . Cells were covered in 200 µl PBS . If not imaged immediately samples were wrapped in parafilm and foil and stored at 4°C prior to microscopy . Phosphotyrosine enrichment at the synapse was calculated by dividing the mean Alexa Fluor 647 signal of a 5 pixel linescan at the synapse with bead or cell by a 5 pixel linescan on the cortex . For phalloidin staining , cells were fixed with 4% PFA for 15 min at room temperature , blocked and permeabilized with 5% BSA in TBS with 0 . 5% triton X overnight , and incubated with AlexaFluor 647 Phalloidin ( Thermo/Molecular Probes , Catalog # A22284 ) for 20 min . Cells were then washed with PBS , imaged and quantified using the method described above . Each data point represents a single cell , and the graphs reflect pooled results from three biological replicates .

After fixation cells were washed 2x with PBS and permeabilized/blocked for 60 min at room temperature in freshly prepared , filter sterilized PBS + 0 . 1% w/v casein +0 . 1% w/v saponin ( PCS solution ) . After permeabilization , cells were washed 1 × 3 min with PCS solution and blocked for 1 hr at room temperature in PCS . Following block , cells were incubated with 1:100 dilution of rabbit anti-ovalbumin ( OVA ) antibody to stain OVA ( Thermo/Pierce , Catalog # PA1-196 ) diluted in PCS solution overnight at 4°C .

Our work shows that inhibitors of ErbB kinases have therapeutic potential in neutrophilic inflammatory disease .", "plain language summary": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( or COPD ) is a serious condition that causes the lungs to become inflamed for long periods of time , leading to permanent damage of the airways . Immune cells known as neutrophils promote inflammation after an injury , or during an infection , to aid the healing process . However , if they are active for too long , they may also cause tissue damage and drive inflammatory diseases including COPD . To limit damage to the body , neutrophils usually have a very short lifespan and die by a regulated process known as apoptosis . Finding ways to stimulate apoptosis in neutrophils may be key to developing better treatments for inflammatory diseases . Cells contain many enzymes known as kinases that control apoptosis and other cell processes . Drugs that inhibit specific kinases are effective treatments for some types of cancer and other conditions , and new kinase-inhibiting drugs are currently being developed . However , it remains unclear which kinases regulate apoptosis in neutrophils or which kinase-inhibiting drugs may have the potential to treat COPD and other inflammatory diseases . To address these questions , Rahman et al . tested over 350 kinase-inhibiting drugs to identify ones that promote apoptosis in neutrophils . The experiments showed that human neutrophils treated with drugs that inhibit the ErbB family of kinases died by apoptosis more quickly than untreated neutrophils . Next , Rahman et al . used zebrafish with injured tail fins as models to study inflammation . Zebrafish treated with one of these drugs – known as Tyrphostin AG825 – had lower levels of inflammation and their neutrophils underwent apoptosis more frequently than untreated zebrafish . Since drugs can have off-target effects , Rahman et al . went on to show using gene-editing technology that reducing the activity of two genes that encode ErbB kinases in zebrafish also decreased the levels of inflammation in the fish . Further experiments used mice that develop inflammation in the lungs similar to COPD in humans . As expected , neutrophils in the lungs of mice treated with Tyrphostin AG825 underwent apoptosis more frequently than those in untreated mice . These dead neutrophils were effectively cleared by other immune cells called macrophages , which also helps limit damage caused by neutrophils . Together , these findings show that Tyrphostin AG825 and other drugs that inhibit ErbB kinases help to reduce inflammation by promoting the death of neutrophils . Since several of these drugs are already used to treat human cancers , it may be possible in the future to repurpose them for use in people with COPD and other long-term inflammatory diseases . Determining whether this is possible is an aim for future studies .", "article": "1 Introduction Neutrophilic inflammation is central to chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , which impose an increasing social and economic burden on our aging population . Treatment of COPD by next-generation combination therapy with inhaled corticosteroids and newer bronchodilators are viewed as maintenance pharmacotherapies but they do not specifically target cellular inflammation . The anti-inflammatory phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor , roflumilast , targets systemic inflammation associated with COPD and reduces moderate to severe exacerbations in severe disease , possibly via effects on eosinophils ( Martinez et al . , 2018; Rabe et al . , 2018 ) . In these diseases , clearance of neutrophils by apoptosis is dysregulated particularly during exacerbations ( Pletz et al . , 2004; Sapey et al . , 2011 ) , but to date it has not been possible to therapeutically modify this , indeed corticosteroids can supress neutrophil apoptosis and hence perpetuate inflammation ( Liles et al . , 1995 ) . Recognising the urgent need for new therapies , we interrogated neutrophil inflammation and survival pathways using an unbiased approach focusing on potentially druggable kinases . Neutrophil persistence in tissues , caused by a delay in apoptosis , can result in a destructive cellular phenotype , whereby neutrophils have greater potential to expel histotoxic factors such as proteases and oxidative molecules onto surrounding tissue . This can occur either actively ( by degranulation ) or passively ( by secondary necrosis ) . In COPD , among other diseases , delayed apoptosis is considered to be a key part of the pathogenesis , occurring either as a result of pro-survival factors that are present in the lung microenvironment or an innate apoptosis defect ( Brown et al . , 2009; Haslett , 1999; Pletz et al . , 2004; Zhang et al . , 2012 ) . Despite this mechanistic understanding , there are no effective treatment strategies in clinical use to specifically reverse this cellular mechanism . Accelerating neutrophil apoptosis has been shown to promote the resolution of inflammation in multiple experimental models ( Burgon et al . , 2014; Chello et al . , 2007; Ren et al . , 2008; Rossi et al . , 2006 ) . A number of studies highlight the importance of protein kinases in regulating neutrophil apoptosis ( Burgon et al . , 2014; Rossi et al . , 2006; Webb et al . , 2000 ) and therefore reveal potential therapeutically targetable pathways for inflammatory disease . A growing class of clinically-exploited small molecule kinase inhibitors are being intensively developed ( Wu et al . , 2015 ) , making this a timely investigation . Using parallel unbiased screening approaches in vitro and in vivo , we here identify inhibitors of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases ( RTKs ) as potential therapeutic drivers of inflammation resolution . The ErbB family consist of four RTKs with structural homology to the human epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR/ErbB1/Her-1 ) . In an in vivo zebrafish model of inflammation , we show that inhibition of ErbBs , pharmacologically and genetically , reduced the number of neutrophils at the site of injury . Furthermore , ErbB inhibitors reduced inflammation in a murine peritonitis model and promoted neutrophil apoptosis and clearance by macrophages in the mouse lung . This study reveals an opportunity for the use of ErbB inhibitors as a treatment for chronic neutrophilic inflammatory disease . 2 Results Using a well-characterised transgenic zebrafish inflammation model ( Henry et al . , 2013; Renshaw et al . , 2006 ) , we adopted a chemical genetics approach , which has great potential for accelerated drug discovery ( Jones and Bunnage , 2017 ) . We initiated inflammation by controlled tissue injury of the zebrafish tail fin and screened a library of kinase inhibitors in order to establish which kinases could be exploited to enhance inflammation resolution in vivo ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1A ) . We quantified the ability of a library of 367 publicly available kinase inhibitors ( PKIS ) ( Elkins et al . , 2016 ) to reduce neutrophil number at the site of injury during the resolution phase of inflammation . The screen identified 16 hit compounds which reduced neutrophil number at the site of injury in the zebrafish model ( Figure 1A ) . For each compound the degree of kinase inhibition had been established ( Elkins et al . , 2016 ) ( Figure 1A ) . A number of kinases were inhibited by the 16 compounds , with Abelson murine leukaemia viral homolog 1 ( ABL1 ) , Platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( PDGFR ) α , PDGFRβ , p38α and ErbB4 being the top five most frequently targeted kinases overall . In addition to frequency of target , we also interrogated selectivity of compound . The most selective compounds , that is those that strongly inhibited individual kinases or kinase families , targeted the kinases YES , ABL1 , p38 and the ErbB family . Apoptosis is an important mechanism contributing to inflammation resolution; we therefore sought to identify kinases common to both inflammation resolution and neutrophil apoptosis pathways . Circulating neutrophils have a short half-life in vivo ( Summers et al . , 2010 ) and undergo spontaneous apoptosis in the absence of growth factors in vitro . We re-screened PKIS library compounds in a human neutrophil apoptosis assay for their ability to accelerate apoptosis ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1B ) . PKIS compounds were screened at 62 µM in order to maximise the chance of identifying ‘hits’ and resulted in 62 compounds that accelerated neutrophil apoptosis ≥2 fold compared to DMSO control ( Figure 1B and Supplementary file 1 ) . Secondary screening of top 38 compounds ( chosen from the 62 hits based on greatest selectivity for kinase targets ) was carried out at 10 µM in order to reduce false positives . This yielded 11 compounds that accelerated neutrophil apoptosis ≥2 fold over control ( as indicated by dashed green line , Figure 1C ) . Representative flow cytometry dot plots illustrating Annexin-V and ToPro-3 profiles for these hit compounds are shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 2 . Kinases targeted by these compounds included DYRK1B , KIT , EGFR , ErbB2 and ErbB4 , PDGFR , CDK6 and p38 ( Figure 1C , inset ) . The identification of known regulators of neutrophil survival ( p38 , PI3K ) was encouraging support for the screen design and execution . We found that members of the ErbB family of RTKs were the next most frequently inhibited kinase family , being targeted by three highly selective compounds out of the 11 hits ( Figure 1C , inset ) . Since inhibitors of the ErbB family were common hits in both zebrafish and human screens , we hypothesised that targeting ErbBs may be a potential strategy to reduce inflammation . To address a role for ErbB antagonists in regulating neutrophil apoptosis we tested a range of clinical and non-clinical ErbB-targeting compounds . We show that among inhibitors of ErbBs that are in clinical use , the EGFR inhibitor , gefitinib , is the most effective in promoting neutrophil apoptosis , reaching significance at 50 µM ( Figure 2A ) . The ErbB2-selective inhibitor , CP-724714 ( Jani et al . , 2007 ) also promoted neutrophil apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 2B ) as did Erbstatin and tyrphostin AG825 , selective for EGFR and ErbB2 respectively ( Osherov et al . , 1993; Umezawa and Imoto , 1991 ) ( Figure 2C–D ) . Since caspase-dependent apoptosis is an anti-inflammatory and pro-resolution form of cell death , engagement of the apoptosis programme was verified biochemically by measuring phosphatidylserine ( PS ) exposure by Annexin-V staining ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–C ) . Furthermore , the pan-caspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPh ( Wardle et al . , 2011 ) completely abrogated Erbstatin and tyrphostin AG825-driven neutrophil apoptosis , confirming the caspase dependence of inhibitor mediated cell death ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1D–E ) . COPD is a chronic inflammatory disease associated with functionally defective circulating neutrophils , including a resistance to undergoing apoptosis during exacerbations ( Pletz et al . , 2004; Sapey et al . , 2011 ) . To show ErbB inhibition is effective in driving apoptosis in subjects with systemic inflammation , we isolated neutrophils from the blood of patients with COPD and age-matched healthy control subjects . Erbstatin and tyrphostin AG825 significantly increased apoptosis of neutrophils from both COPD patients and healthy control subjects in a dose dependent manner at both 6 hr ( Figure 2E–F ) and 20 hr ( data not shown ) . ErbB inhibition overcomes neutrophil survival stimuli . Neutrophils are exposed to multiple pro-survival stimuli at sites of inflammation , which could undermine the therapeutic potential of anti-inflammatory drugs . Factors that raise intracellular cAMP concentration ( [cAMP]i ) are present during inflammation , and elevated [cAMP]i is known to prolong neutrophil survival via activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinases ( Krakstad et al . , 2004; Vaughan et al . , 2007 ) . We show that neutrophil apoptosis was reduced by the cAMP analogue and site selective activator of PKA , N6-monobutyryl-cAMP ( N6-MB-cAMP ) , and that this was reversed by Erbstatin analog ( Figure 3A ) and Tyrphostin AG825 ( Figure 3B ) . Similar effects were observed in neutrophils from patients with COPD ( Figure 3C ) . GMCSF is a key neutrophil chemoattractant and pro-survival factor , and is closely associated with the severity of inflammation in disease ( Klein et al . , 2000; Wicks and Roberts , 2016 ) . We show that erbstatin and tyrphostin AG825 prevent GMCSF-mediated survival in COPD and age-matched healthy control neutrophils ( Figure 3D–E ) . GMCSF is known to promote neutrophil survival via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3K ) /AKT pathway , ultimately leading to the stabilisation of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member , Mcl-1 ( Derouet et al . , 2004; Klein et al . , 2000 ) . To investigate potential mechanisms underpinning the ability of tyrphostin AG825 to prevent GMCSF-mediated survival , we assessed AKT-phosphorylation as a measure of PI3K activation and found that tyrphostin AG825 reduced GMCSF-induced AKT phosphorylation after 15 and 30 min of treatment becoming statistically significant at 15 mins ( Figure 3F ) . Tyrphostin AG825 accelerated the spontaneous downregulation of Mcl-1 and also prevented GMCSF-induced stabilisation of Mcl-1 ( Figure 3G ) . These data show ErbB inhibition engages neutrophil apoptosis even in the presence of inflammatory stimuli and therefore has the potential to drive apoptosis at inflammatory sites . To explore whether ErbB family members are phosphorylated in response to survival stimuli we studied the activated kinome in human neutrophils stimulated with N6-MB-cAMP ( Vaughan et al . , 2007 ) . A Kinex antibody microarray was performed to detect the phosphorylation of over 400 kinases and kinase-associated proteins and this data set was interrogated to seek evidence of activation of ErbB by N6-MB-cAMP . Of the phospho-specific antibodies , 17 yielded an increase over baseline control of ≥1 . 5 at 30 min and 8 at 60 min ( Table 1 ) . Among these targets , ErbB2 phosphorylation was detected at 30 min ( 1 . 94 > control ) and 60 min ( 1 . 53 > control , Table 1 ) . This suggests that ErbB is part of the neutrophil signalling response to survival stimuli . In support of this , we detected the presence of ErbB2 mRNA in human neutrophils by RT-PCR ( Figure 4A ) and a 60kD protein ( lower molecular weight ErbB family products are well-documented ( Jackson et al . , 2013; Guillaudeau et al . , 2012; Siegel , 1999; Ward et al . , 2013 ) which was upregulated by GMCSF and dbcAMP ( Figure 4B ) . ErbB3 was also detected in human neutrophils by ELISA ( Figure 4C ) , at levels similar to those observed in other tissues in literature ( Buta et al . , 2016 ) . We found ErbB3 expression was not regulated by growth factors , which may in part be due to regulation being primarily at the post-translational level . To determine the ability of ErbB inhibition to exert an effect on neutrophil number and apoptosis in vivo , we used three complementary animal models of acute inflammation . To specifically address whether tyrphostin AG825 was able to accelerate apoptosis of neutrophils in the mammalian lung , we used a murine model of LPS-induced airway inflammation ( Thompson et al . , 2014 ) . C57BL/6 mice nebulised with LPS developed an acute pulmonary neutrophilia after 48 hr , to a degree seen previously ( Figure 5A–B ) ( Thompson et al . , 2014 ) . Tyrphostin AG825 had no effect on percentage of , or absolute number of neutrophils or macrophages compared to DMSO control ( Figure 5A–B ) . Tyrphostin AG825 significantly increased the percentage of neutrophil apoptosis , both visualised as ‘free’ apoptotic cells ( closed circles ) and as a summation of both free apoptotic cells and apoptotic inclusions within macrophages in order to capture those that had been efferocytosed ( closed triangles , Figure 5C ) . Macrophage efferocytosis was also significantly elevated by tyrphostin AG825 , compared to vehicle control ( Figure 5D ) , determined by counting the number of macrophages containing apoptotic inclusions as a proportion of total macrophages ( Figure 5E ) . We next tested the anti-inflammatory potential of tyrphostin AG825 when administered once inflammation was established , which is more representative of the clinical scenario . Mice were i . p injected with zymosan to induce peritonitis and after 4 hr were treated ( i . p . ) with tyrphostin AG825 or vehicle control . Total cell counts in peritoneal lavage were 2 . 2 × 106 in PBS vs 1 . 7 × 107 in zymosan treated animals at 4 hr demonstrating established inflammation at this time point ( Navarro-Xavier et al . , 2010 ) . Importantly , tyrphostin AG825 does not induce leukopenia ( Figure 5F ) , however significantly fewer inflammatory cells were found in peritoneal lavage following tyrphostin AG825 treatment ( Figure 5G ) . The neutrophil chemoattractant and proinflammatory cytokine , KC , was reduced in tyrphostin AG825 treated mice , and concomitant with this , a trend for less IL-6 was also observed ( Figure 5H ) . IgM , which correlates with the number and activation of peritoneal B lymphocytes ( Almeida et al . , 2001 ) , is significantly reduced in tyrphostin AG825-treated mice ( Figure 5I ) . To further extend this observation , we tested the ability of ErbB inhibitors to modulate neutrophilic inflammation resolution as a whole , in a model which encompasses multiple mechanisms of neutrophil removal including both apoptosis and reverse migration . In the mpx:GFP zebrafish tail fin injury model ( Renshaw et al . , 2006 ) ( Figure 6A ) we were able to show that tyrphostin AG825 ( Figure 6B ) and CP-724714 ( Figure 6C ) significantly reduced the number of neutrophils at the site of injury at 4 and 8 hpi . Simultaneous gene knockdown of egfra and erbb2 via CRISPR/Cas9 ( referred to as ‘crispants’ ) also recapitulated this phenotype ( Figure 6D ) . Tyrphostin AG825 did not affect total neutrophil number ( Figure 6E ) , but egfra and erbb2 crispants had significantly fewer neutrophils ( Figure 6F ) . As demonstrated by TSA and TUNEL double staining ( Figure 6G ) , tyrphostin AG825 upregulated neutrophil apoptosis at both the site of injury ( Figure 6H ) and in the caudal hematopoietic tissue ( CHT ) of zebrafish ( Figure 6I ) . CHT neutrophil counts were unchanged between conditions ( data not shown ) . egfra and erbb2 crispants had increased numbers of apoptotic neutrophils at the site of injury , but this was not significant ( Figure 6J ) , perhaps suggesting the presence of compensatory mechanisms . These findings show that inhibiting ErbB RTKs accelerate neutrophil apoptosis in vitro and in vivo and enhance inflammation resolution , making ErbB inhibitors an attractive therapeutic strategy for inflammatory disease . 3 Discussion Neutrophils are powerful immune cells because of their destructive anti-microbial contents . A deleterious by-product of this is their remarkable histotoxic potential to host tissue , ordinarily held in check by the onset of apoptosis . The inappropriate suppression of neutrophil apoptosis underpins a number of chronic inflammatory diseases , and we are yet to have available an effective treatment strategy that can reverse this cellular defect in clinical practice . Here we show in human , mouse and zebrafish models of inflammation and neutrophil cell death that targeting the ErbB family of RTKs regulates neutrophil survival and resolves inflammation . Promoting neutrophil apoptosis is a desirable approach for the resolution of inflammation , since apoptosis functionally downregulates the cell , promotes rapid cell clearance by efferocytosis and engages an anti-inflammatory phenotype in phagocytosing cells ( Savill et al . , 1989; Whyte et al . , 1999 ) . As proof of principle , driving apoptosis experimentally promotes the resolution of inflammation across multiple disease models ( Chello et al . , 2007; Ren et al . , 2008; Rossi et al . , 2006 ) . Several compounds targeting the ErbB family have been approved as medicines for the treatment of cancer ( Singh et al . , 2016 ) . Our findings open up the possibility of repurposing well-tolerated ErbB inhibitors for patients with inflammatory disease , potentially addressing a currently unmet clinical need . The ErbB family are critical regulators of cell proliferation and are associated with the development of many human malignancies ( Roskoski , 2014 ) . In addition to the development of cancer , ErbB members have known roles in inflammatory diseases of the airway , skin and gut ( Davies et al . , 1999; Finigan et al . , 2011; Frey and Brent Polk , 2014; Hamilton et al . , 2003; Pastore et al . , 2008 ) . In the context of lung inflammation , ErbB2 is upregulated in whole lung lysates in murine bleomycin models of lung injury and EGFR ligands are increased in BAL from acute lung injury patients receiving mechanical ventilation ( Finigan et al . , 2011 ) , suggesting ErbB signalling axes may play a role in the process of airway inflammation in vivo . We show , in murine models where Tyrphostin AG825 was administered either at the time of inflammatory stimulus or once inflammation was established , an impact on cell number , proinflammatory cytokine production and neutrophil apoptosis , further validating the use of ErbB inhibitors to reduce inflammation . The benefit of EGFR inhibitors in reducing inflammation in ventilator-induced and OVA/LPS-induced lung injury rodent models is shown by others , further supporting the targetting of this pathway in inflammatory disease settings ( Bierman et al . , 2008; Shimizu et al . , 2018; Takezawa et al . , 2016 ) . Others have reported that neutrophils express members of the ErbB family ( Lewkowicz et al . , 2005 ) , particularly ErbB2 at low levels ( Petryszak et al . , 2016 ) and we show that they are phosphorylated and regulated following exposure to inflammatory stimuli . ErbBs have known roles in suppressing apoptosis of epithelial cells and keratinocytes , but this study is the first to show a role for ErbBs in survival signalling of myeloid cells . Little is known about the roles of ErbBs in neutrophil function . Erbstatin has been shown to inhibit neutrophil ROS production ( Dreiem et al . , 2003; Mócsai et al . , 1997; Reistad et al . , 2005 ) and chemotactic responses ( Yasui et al . , 1994 ) . Other kinase families have been found to play a role in neutrophil survival and neutrophilic inflammation , most notably the cyclin-dependent kinases ( CDKs ) ( Rossi et al . , 2006 ) . In accordance with this , compounds targeting CDKs were identified as drivers of neutrophil apoptosis in both our primary and secondary screens . Moreover , p38 MAPK inhibitor compounds were also identified in both zebrafish and human screens , and since this kinase is known to mediate survival signals , these findings give confidence to the robustness of the screen design and execution . The engagement of apoptosis by the ErbB inhibitors erbstatin and tyrphostin AG825 was confirmed both biochemically by phosphatidylserine exposure , and mechanistically by the caspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPh and loss of Mcl-1 . This suggests that inhibiting ErbBs as a therapeutic strategy may achieve an overall anti-inflammatory effect in in vivo systems , facilitating clearance by macrophages . In support of this , we provide evidence of increased efferocytosis in vivo following tyrphostin AG825 treatment , with no evidence of secondary neutrophil necrosis due to overwhelming macrophage clearance capacity , evidenced both morphologically and by TO-PRO-3 staining . The ability of ErbB inhibitors to promote neutrophil apoptosis even in the presence of multiple pro-survival stimuli emphasises the potential of ErbB inhibitors in the lung , at sites where inflammatory mediators are in abundance and where neutrophils are exposed to microorganisms . This is supported by the ability of tyrphostin AG825 to prevent early pro-survival signalling in response to GMCSF , including the phosphorylation of AKT . This precedes the onset of apoptosis , occurring at a time point ( 15 min ) where apoptosis is typically less than 1% . Others have shown the ability of erbstatin to prevent GMCSF-mediated activation of PI3K in human neutrophils , although the impact on cell survival was not studied ( al-Shami et al . , 1997 ) . Therefore , ErbBs may function as an early and upstream component of the survival pathway in neutrophils . Subsequent impact on Mcl-1 destabilisation by tyrphostin AG825 at 8 hr suggests a cellular mechanism by which these pro-apoptotic effects are mediated . The effects of ErbB inhibitors in driving spontaneous apoptosis suggest that , under certain circumstances , ErbB activity might be required for constitutive neutrophil survival . It is not clear what , if anything , engages ErbB signalling in culture . The rapid phosphorylation of ErbB2 following N6-MB-cAMP treatment ( 30 min ) suggests that perhaps a ligand is not required , or that the neutrophils can rapidly release ErbB agonists in an autocrine manner . Unlike all other ErbBs , ErbB2 monomers exist in a constitutively active conformation and can form homodimers that do not require a ligand for activation ( Fan et al . , 2008 ) . ErbBs achieve great signalling diversity: in part because of the individual biochemical properties of ligands and multiple homo-heterodimer combinations , and in part because they activate multiple components including those known to be critical in neutrophil cell survival such as PI3K , MAPK and GSK-3 , as well as phosphorylating the Bcl-2 protein Bad which inhibits its death-promoting activity ( Yarden and Sliwkowski , 2001 ) . A limitation of our study is the genetically intractability of human neutrophils , meaning we cannot exclude the possibility that the inhibitors are having off target effects in this system . Mammalian models of ErbB deletion are limited by profound abnormalities in utero and during development ( Britsch et al . , 1998; Dackor et al . , 2007; Gassmann et al . , 1995; Miettinen et al . , 1995; Riethmacher et al . , 1997 ) . For this reason , CRISPR/Cas9 was used to knockdown egfra and erbb2 in zebrafish , which confirmed a role for ErbBs in resolving inflammation . Targeting ErbBs genetically and pharmacologically reduces the number of neutrophils at the site of injury in zebrafish , which may reflect inhibition of a number of pathways that regulate neutrophil number in the tissue , including migration pathways ( Ellett et al . , 2015 ) . However , the increase in apoptotic neutrophil count at the site of injury with ErbB inhibitor treatment suggests ErbBs may be inducing anti-apoptotic signalling pathways within this inflammatory environment , which could at least in part be causing the phenotype . The reduced neutrophil count at the injury site may also be due to the increase in apoptotic neutrophils in the CHT , which may be preventing neutrophil migration to sites of injury . The unchanged whole body neutrophil number is potentially due to compensatory upregulation of neutrophil production within the CHT . Genetic deletion , but not pharmacological inhibition , of egfra and erbb2 significantly reduced whole body neutrophil number , which may reflect crispants being without egfra and erbb2 genes from a one-cell stage . Reduced neutrophils at the injury site of crispants may be explained by their reduced whole body neutrophil number , but potentially also defects in the migratory response of these neutrophils to a site of inflammation . Murine models of inflammatory disease , where tyrphostin AG825 was administered either at the time of inflammatory stimulus or once inflammation was established , show an impact on cell number , proinflammatory cytokine production and neutrophil apoptosis , further validating the use of ErbB inhibitors to reduce inflammation . In conclusion , we have identified a previously undefined role for ErbB RTKs in neutrophil survival pathways and a potential new use for ErbB inhibitors in accelerating inflammation resolution . These findings suggest the ErbB family of kinases may be novel targets for treatments of chronic inflammatory disease , and the potential for repurposing ErbB inhibitors currently in use for cancer may have significant clinical potential in a broader range of indications . 4 Materials and methods Our objectives for this study are to identify compounds that are able to resolve neutrophilic inflammation . To do this we performed unbiased chemical screens in both human neutrophils in vitro and zebrafish models of inflammation in vivo . Results were validated in murine models of peritoneal and airway inflammation and zebrafish tail injury models . Genetic evidence was obtained by CRISPR/Cas9 genetic editing in zebrafish . Neutrophils were isolated from peripheral blood of healthy subjects and COPD patients by dextran sedimentation and discontinuous plasma-Percoll gradient centrifugation , as previously described ( Haslett et al . , 1985; Ward et al . , 1999b ) in compliance with the guidelines of the South Sheffield Research Ethics Committee ( for young healthy subjects; reference number: STH13927 ) and the National Research Ethics Service ( NRES ) Committee Yorkshire and the Humber ( for COPD and age-matched healthy subjects; reference number: 10/H1016/25 ) . Informed consent was obtained after the nature and possible consequences of the study were explained . Mean age in years was 61 . 7 ± 2 . 3 ( n = 10 ) and 66 . 0 ± 3 . 6 ( n = 7 ) for COPD and age-matched healthy subjects respectively . Ultrapure neutrophils , for Kinexus antibody array experiments , were obtained by immunomagnetic negative selection as previously described ( Sabroe et al . , 2002 ) . Neutrophils were cultured ( 2 . 5 × 106/ml ) in RPMI 1640 ( Gibco , Invitrogen Ltd ) supplemented with 10% FCS 1% penicillin-streptomycin , in the presence or absence of the following reagents: GMCSF ( PeproTech , Inc ) , N6-MB-cAMP ( Biolog ) , anti-ErbB3 blocking antibody , Tyrphostin AG825 ( both Sigma-Aldrich ) , CP-724714 ( AdooQ Bioscience ) , Erbstatin analog ( Cayman Chemicals ) , Pyocyanin ( Usher et al . , 2002 ) or compounds from PKIS ( Published Kinase Inhibitor Set 1 , GlaxoSmithKline ) at concentrations as indicated . In vitro screening of PKIS in neutrophil apoptosis assays . PKIS consists of 367 small molecule protein kinase inhibitors and is profiled with respect to target specificity ( Elkins et al . , 2016 ) . In primary screen experiments , neutrophils ( from five independent donors over 5 days ) were incubated with each compound at 62 µM for 6 hr . Apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry ( Attune , Invitrogen ) . Secondary screening was performed with selected compounds that accelerated neutrophil apoptosis greater than twofold in the primary screen . Compounds were incubated with neutrophils at 10 µM for 6 hr and apoptosis assessed by Attune flow cytometry . Neutrophil apoptosis was assessed by light microscopy and by flow cytometry . Briefly , for the assessment of apoptosis by light microscopy based on well-characterised morphological changes , neutrophils were cytocentrifuged , fixed with methanol , stained with Reastain Quick-Diff ( Gentaur ) , and then apoptotic and non-apoptotic neutrophils were counted with an inverted , oil immersion microscope ( Nikon Eclipse TE300 , Japan ) at 100X magnification ( Savill et al . , 1989 ) . To assess apoptosis by flow cytometry , neutrophils were stained with PE conjugated Annexin-V ( BD Pharminogen ) and TO-PRO-3 ( Thermofisher Scientific ) ( Savill et al . , 1989; Vermes et al . , 1995; Ward et al . , 1999a ) and sample acquisition was performed by an Attune flow cytometer ( Life Technologies ) and data analysed by FlowJo ( FlowJo LLC ) . Neutrophils were incubated with N6-MB-cAMP [100 µM] for 30 and 60 min or lysed immediately following isolation ( t0 ) . Cells were lysed in PBS containing Triton-X , 1 µM PMSF and protease inhibitor cocktail and following 2 min on ice were centrifuged at 10 , 000 RPM to remove insoluble material . Lysates ( containing protein at 6 mg/mL ) from four donors were pooled prior to Kinex antibody microarray analysis ( Kinexus Bioinformatics ) ( Zhang and Pelech , 2012 ) . Lysates are subjected to 812 antibodies including phospho-site specific antibodies to specifically measure phosphorylation of the target protein . Fluorescent signals from the array were corrected to background and log2 transformed and a Z score calculated by subtracting the overall average intensity of all spots within a sample , from the raw intensity for each spot , and dividing it by the standard deviations ( SD ) of all the measured intensities within each sample ( Cheadle et al . , 2003 ) . Z ratio values are further calculated by taking the difference between the averages of the Z scores and dividing by the SD of all differences of the comparison ( e . g , 30 min treated samples versus 0 min control ) . A Z ratio of ±1 . 5 is considered to be a significant change from control . Whole cell lysates were prepared by resuspending human neutrophils ( 5 × 106 ) in 50 µl hypotonic lysis buffer ( 1 mM PMSF , 50 mM NaF , 10 mM Sodium orthovanadate , protease inhibitors cocktail in water ) , and by boiling with 50 µl 2X SDS buffer ( 0 . 1M 1 , 4-Dithio-DL-threitol , 4% SDS , 20% Glycerol , 0 . 0625M Tris-HCl pH6 . 8% and 0 . 004% Bromophenol blue ) . Protein samples were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis , and electrotransfer onto PVDF ( polyvenylidene difluoride ) membranes was performed by semi-dry blotting method . Membranes were then blocked with 5% skimmed milk in TBS-tween and probed against antibodies to p-AKT , AKT ( both Cell signalling Technology ) , Mcl-1 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , ErbB2 ( New England Biolabs ) , p38 or β-actin ( loading controls , StressMarq Biosciences Inc or Sigma respectively ) , followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies and detection with chemiluminescent substrate solution ECL2 ( GE Healthcare ) . The neutrophil-specific , GFP-expressing transgenic zebrafish line , Tg ( mpx:GFP ) i114 , ( referred to as mpx:GFP ) ( Renshaw et al . , 2006 ) was raised and maintained according to standard protocols ( Nüsslein-Volhard and Dahm , 2002 ) in UK Home Office approved aquaria in the Bateson Centre at the University of Sheffield , according to institutional guidelines . Adult fish are maintained in 14 hr light and 10 hr dark cycle at 28°C . PKIS screening: Tail fin transection was performed on mpx:GFP zebrafish larvae at 3 days post-fertilisation ( dpf ) ( Elks et al . , 2011; Renshaw et al . , 2006 ) . At 6 hr post-injury ( hpi ) , larvae that had mounted a good inflammatory response , as defined by recruitment of >15 neutrophils to the injury site , were arrayed at a density of 3 larvae per well and incubated with PKIS compounds at a final concentration of 25 µM or vehicle control for a further 6 hr . At 12 hpi , the plate was scanned using prototype PhenoSight equipment ( Ash Biotech ) . Images were scored manually as described previously ( Robertson et al . , 2014 ) . In brief , each well of three larvae was assigned a score between 0–3 , corresponding to the number of larvae within the well with a reduced number of neutrophils at the site of injury . Kinase inhibitors which reduced green fluorescence at the injury site to an extent that their mean score was ≥1 . 5 were regarded as hit compounds . ErbB inhibition studies: Briefly , two dpf mpx:GFP larvae were treated with Tyrphostin AG825 [10 µM] for 16 hr before undergoing tailfin transection ( Elks et al . , 2011; Renshaw et al . , 2006 ) . The number of neutrophils at the site of injury was determined at 4 and 8 hpi by counting GFP-positive neutrophils by fluorescent microscopy . To enumerate neutrophils across the whole body , uninjured larvae were treated with Tyrphostin AG825 [10 µM] for 24 hr and then mounted in 0 . 8% low-melting point agarose ( Sigma-Aldrich ) followed by imaging by fluorescence microscopy ( Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U ) at 4X magnification , followed by manual counting . Larvae from each experimental group were pooled into 1 . 5 mL eppendorf tubes . TSA signal amplification of GFP-labelled neutrophils ( driven by endogenous peroxidase activity ) was carried out using TSA Plus Fluorescein System ( Perkin Elmer ) . Larvae were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4°C after which they were subjected to proteinase K digestion . Larvae were post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde , before subsequent TUNEL staining for apoptosis using ApopTag Red In Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit ( Millipore ) . Larvae were then mounted in low-melting point agarose and images acquired and analysed using UltraVIEWVoX spinning disc confocal laser imaging system with Volocity 6 . 3 software ( Perkin Elmer ) . Apoptotic neutrophil count was determined firstly by identifying cells with co-localisation of the TSA and TUNEL stains , then confirmed by accounting for apoptotic neutrophil morphology . Transient dual knockdown of egfra and erbb2 was induced using a Cas9 nuclease ( New England Biolabs ) in combination with transactivating RNA ( tracr ) and synthetic guide RNAs specific to zebrafish egfra and erbb2 genes ( Merck ) . The non-targetting control in these experiments was a guide RNA targetted towards tyrosinase , a gene involved in pigment formation and therefore easy to identify when mutated , and which is used by others in the field as a CRISPR/Cas9 control ( O’Connor et al . , 2019; Varshney et al . , 2016 ) . We have previously shown that this guide does not influence neutrophilic inflammation in the zebrafish ( Evans et al . , 2019; Isles et al . , 2019 ) . Guide RNAs were designed using the online tool CHOPCHOP ( https://chopchop . cbu . uib . no/ ) with the following sequences: efgra: TGAATCTCGGAGCGCGCAGGAGG; erbb2: AACGCTTTGGACCTACACGTGGG; tyrosinase: GGACUGGAGGACUUCUGGGG . Each guide RNA was resuspended to 20 μM in nuclease-free water with 10 mM Tris-HCl ( pH8 ) . Guide RNA [20 μM] , tracr [20 μM] and Cas9 protein [20 μM] were combined ( in a 1:1:1 ratio ) . 0 . 5 μL phenol red was added to each injection solution for visualisation . A graticule was used to calibrate glass capillary needles to dispense 0 . 5 nL of injection solution , and 1 nL was injected into the yolk sac of single-cell stage mpx:GFP embryos . Tail injury assays were carried out at two dpf as described above . High-resolution melt curve analysis was used to determine the rate of egfra and erbb2 mutation in larvae at two dpf . Genomic DNA was collected from individual larvae in both the control and experimental groups , by adding 90 μL 50 mM NaOH to each larvae in a 96-well qPCR plate and incubating at 95°C for 20 min . 10 μL Tris-HCl ( pH 8 ) was then added as a buffer . Master mixes containing either egfra or erbb2 primers ( Integrated DNA Technologies ) ( sequences in table below ) were made up , with each well containing: 0 . 5 μL 10 μM forward primer , 0 . 5 μL 10 μM reverse primer , 5 μL 2X DyNAmo Flash SYBR Green ( Thermo Scientific ) , 3 μL milliQ water . One μL genomic DNA was added to each master mix in a 96-well qPCR plate . Melt curve analysis was performed and analysed with Bio-Rad Precision Melt Analysis software . Mutation rate was calculated by determining the percentage of egfra erbb2 larvae that showed a different melt-curve profile to the genomic DNA collected from tyrosinase fish ( based on 95% confidence intervals ) . The average mutation rate in our experiments was 97 . 5% and 87 . 9% for egfra and erbb2 , respectively . Primer sequences used for high-resolution melt curve analysis .

Protocols were produced in line with PREPARE guidelines and FRAME recommendations and were reviewed by the University of Sheffield’s Animal Welfare Committee . C57BL/6 mice ( female , 9–10 weeks old ) were nebulised with LPS ( 3 mg per group of 8 mice ) ( Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Sigma-Aldrich ) and immediately injected intraperitoneally ( i . p . ) with either Tyrphostin AG825 ( Tocris Bioscience ) at 20 mg/Kg in 10% DMSO v/v in vegetable oil ( eight mice , treatment group ) or an equivalent volume of 10% DMSO v/v in vegetable oil ( eight mice , control group ) ( Kedrin et al . , 2009; Roos et al . , 2014 ) . After 48 hr the mice were sacrificed by terminal anaesthesia by i . p . pentobarbitone and subjected to bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL , 4 × 1 mL of saline ) . BAL samples were microcentrifuged and the cellular fraction counted by a hemocytometer and cytocentrifuged . Neutrophil apoptosis and macrophage efferocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils was quantified by oil immersion light microscopy ( Nikon Eclipse TE300 , Japan ) . C57BL/6 mice were i . p . injected with 1 mg zymosan ( Sigma-Aldrich ) and 4 hr later injected i . p with 20 mg/Kg Tyrphostin AG825 in 10% DMSO v/v in vegetable oil ( five mice , treatment group ) or an equivalent volume of 10% DMSO v/v in vegetable oil ( five mice , control group ) . At 20 hr the mice were subjected to terminal gaseous anaesthesia ( isoflurane ) followed by a cardiac puncture and peritoneal lavage ( 4 × 1 mL of saline ) . WBC , neutrophils and macrophages were enumerated in blood by an automated haematology analyser ( KX-21N , Sysmex , Milton Keynes , UK ) . Lavage samples were microcentrifuged and the cellular fraction subjected to flow cytometry and cytocentrifuged for light microscopy . IL-6 , KC ( Duoset ELISA kits , R and D systems ) and IgM ( Thermofisher Scientific ) in cell free lavage were measured by ELISA as per manufacturer’s instructions . Data were analysed using GraphPad Prism 8 ( GraphPad Software , San Diego , CA ) using one-way or two-way ANOVA ( with appropriate post-test detailed in the Figure legends ) for all in vitro data and appropriate in vivo experiments . Non-parametric tests ( Mann-Whitney U-test or Kruskal-Wallis test ) were used for selected in vivo experiments with non-Gaussian distribution .

But what will their lifespans be in the next decades ? Reliable answers to this question are essential to help governments plan for future health care and social security costs . While medical improvements are likely to further extend lifespans , lifestyle factors can result in temporal distortions of this trend . Yet , most estimates of future life expectancy fail to consider changing lifestyles , as they only use past mortality trends in their calculations . This can make these projections unreliable: for example , increases in smoking rates among Northern and Western European men led to stagnating male life expectancies in the 1950s and 1960s , but these picked up again after smoking declined . The same pattern is showing for women , except it is lagging as they took up smoking later than men . Based simply on the extrapolation of past mortality trends , current projection models fail to consider the past and predicted modifications of life expectancy trends prompted by changing rates of health behaviours – such as increases followed by ( anticipated ) declines in alcohol consumption and obesity rates , similar to what was observed with smoking . To produce a more reliable forecast , Janssen et al . incorporated trends in smoking , obesity , and alcohol use into life expectancy projections for 18 European countries . The predictions suggest that life expectancy for women in these countries will increase from 83 . 4 years in 2014 to 92 . 8 years in 2065 . For men , it will also go up , from 78 . 3 to 90 . 5 years . In the future , this integrative approach may help to track the effects of health-behaviour related prevention policies on life expectancy , and allow scientists to account for changes caused by the COVID-19 pandemic . In the meantime , these estimates are higher than those obtained using more traditional methods; they suggest that communities should start to adjust to the possibility of longer individual lifespans , and of larger numbers of elderly people in society .", "article": "1 Introduction Mortality projections are essential for forecasting how long people will live on average , for predicting the future extent of population ageing , for determining the sustainability of pension schemes and social security systems , for setting life insurance premiums , and for helping governments plan for the demand for services such as healthcare ( European Commission , 2009 ) . Recently , the societal and academic relevance of obtaining reliable and robust mortality forecasts has increased due to the revived debate on the existence and proximity of a limit to human life expectancy ( Fries , 1980; Manton et al . , 1991; Couzin , 2005; de Beer et al . , 2017; Olshansky and Carnes , 2019; Vaupel et al . , 2021 ) ; the linkage between life expectancy developments and retirement age in many European countries ( Carone et al . , 2016; OECD , 2016 ) ; the stagnation of increases in life expectancy in the United States , the United Kingdom , and other European countries since 2011 ( Murphy et al . , 2019; Raleigh , 2019 ) ; and the recent COVID-19 pandemic . The growing relevance of obtaining reliable mortality forecasts has led to important advances in mortality forecasting by professionals and researchers from – among others – demography , actuarial sciences , and public health ( Janssen , 2018 ) . In the past , mortality forecasts were often based on expectations fuelled by the debate on the limit to life expectancy ( Oeppen and Vaupel , 2002; Booth and Tickle , 2008 ) . The majority of the currently existing mortality forecasting methods , including those used by statistical offices in Europe , are mainly based on extrapolations of past trends in age-specific mortality ( Booth and Tickle , 2008; Stoeldraijer et al . , 2013a ) . These extrapolative methods rely on the regularities observed in mortality trends over time and in the age patterns ( Booth and Tickle , 2008 ) . An extrapolative approach to mortality forecasting is considered more objective , easier to apply , and more likely to result in reliable forecasts than the previously employed expectation approaches and explanation approaches ( mortality forecasting by cause of death or with an explanatory model ) ( Booth and Tickle , 2008 ) . The stochastic Lee–Carter mortality projection methodology ( Lee and Carter , 1992 ) has long been the benchmark extrapolative mortality forecasting method ( see Janssen , 2018 ) . It is , however , increasingly being acknowledged that mechanically extrapolating past national mortality trends can result in unreliable outcomes ( e . g . , Janssen and Kunst , 2007; Janssen et al . , 2013; Bongaarts , 2014; Stoeldraijer , 2019; Li and Raftery , 2021; Blakely , 2018 ) . First , when past trends in mortality are non-linear , the projection outcome will depend to a large extent on the period on which the extrapolation is based ( Janssen and Kunst , 2007; Janssen et al . , 2013; Stoeldraijer , 2019 ) . Second , extrapolative mortality forecasts made for individual populations often project unrealistic crossovers or large future differences in life expectancy between populations ( Li and Lee , 2005; Janssen et al . , 2013; Hyndman et al . , 2013 ) . For example , extrapolating the large mortality declines observed in Eastern European countries – which have historically had relatively low life expectancy , but have experienced improvements since 2005 ( Trias-Llimós et al . , 2018 ) – would result in long-term future life expectancy values being higher in Eastern than in Western European countries with historically high life expectancy values and more moderate mortality declines . We argue that to obtain a reliable and robust mortality forecast , it is essential to distinguish between ( 1 ) the general and gradual long-term mortality decline due to socio-economic and medical progress that can be extrapolated into the future , thereby taking into account the mortality experiences of other countries , and ( 2 ) remaining factors that cause deviations from this general mortality decline as well as country and sex differences in this trend . While life expectancy has increased overall as a result of socio-economic and medical progress ( Omran , 1998; Oeppen and Vaupel , 2002; Mackenbach , 2013 ) , past trends in mortality and life expectancy were characterised by periods of stagnation or even decline and exhibited large differences between countries and sexes ( e . g . , Vallin and Meslé , 2004; Leon , 2011 ) . Lifestyle factors , particularly smoking , alcohol abuse , and obesity , contributed greatly to these deviations and differences ( e . g . , Lhachimi et al . , 2016; WHO , 2018a; Janssen et al . , 2021 ) . For example , the decelerating life expectancy improvements among men in many north-western European countries in the 1950s and 1960s , and , in later decades , in other European countries and among women , can be largely explained by the smoking epidemic ( Rostron and Wilmoth , 2011; Janssen et al . , 2015; Lindahl-Jacobsen et al . , 2016 ) . The pattern of a rapid increase and a subsequent decline in smoking prevalence occurred first among men in Anglo-Saxon countries , and was followed later in other countries and by women ( Lopez et al . , 1994 ) . These developments resulted in similar patterns in smoking-attributable mortality about 30–40 years later ( Lopez et al . , 1994; Janssen , 2020 ) . The large increases in alcohol consumption and alcohol-attributable mortality between 1990 and 2005 in Eastern Europe contributed to the stalling of life expectancy improvements in Eastern Europe in this period ( Trias-Llimós et al . , 2018 ) . The more favourable alcohol-related trends in Eastern Europe since 2005 have contributed to the convergence in life expectancy levels between Eastern and Western Europe . The stagnation in life expectancy improvements since approximately 2011 in the United States and the United Kingdom , but also in other selected European countries ( Murphy et al . , 2019 ) , can be partly attributed to the high obesity prevalence and obesity-attributable mortality in these countries ( Raleigh , 2019; Janssen et al . , 2020a; Janssen et al . , 2020b ) and to the increasing impact on life expectancy levels of past large increases in obesity prevalence ( Vidra et al . , 2019 ) . Previous mortality forecasts that incorporated lifestyle information ( Bongaarts , 2006; Pampel , 2005; Wang and Preston , 2009; King and Soneji , 2011; Preston et al . , 2014; French and O'Hare , 2013; Foreman et al . , 2018; Janssen and Kunst , 2007; Janssen et al . , 2013; Li and Raftery , 2021 ) generally included information on only one lifestyle factor , usually smoking . Moreover , these forecasts employed very different techniques and ignored the mortality experiences of other countries . The previous so-called coherent or multi-population forecasting methods that take into account the mortality experiences of other countries ( Li and Lee , 2005; Hyndman et al . , 2013; Enchev et al . , 2017; Eurostat , 2020b; Bergeron-Boucher et al . , 2018 ) have , despite their growing popularity , so far been applied almost exclusively to all-cause mortality . The two previous projections that incorporated both elements simultaneously only included the effect of smoking ( Janssen et al . , 2013; Li and Raftery , 2021 ) . The approach developed for this purpose by Janssen et al . , 2013 consists of the combination of a coherent projection of non-smoking-related mortality with an age-period-cohort projection of smoking-attributable mortality . This approach was applied to the Netherlands ( Janssen et al . , 2013 ) and was adopted by Statistics Netherlands as part of their official population forecast ( Stoeldraijer et al . , 2013b ) . Li and Raftery , 2021 applied an amended version of this approach to 69 countries . Our objective is to project future life expectancy in 18 European countries , while simultaneously taking into account the time-varying impact of smoking , obesity , and alcohol on mortality , and the mortality experiences of forerunner populations . 2 Materials and methods Our approach to mortality forecasting relied on an analysis of past mortality trends and their determinants . In line with the evidence gathered , we distinguished between ( 1 ) the general and gradual long-term mortality decline not affected by the three lifestyle factors that could be extrapolated into the future , while taking into account the mortality experiences of other countries , and ( 2 ) deviations from and differences in this general mortality decline caused predominantly by the time-varying impact of smoking , obesity , and alcohol on mortality , which required the use of more advanced projection techniques . The projection involved four steps . First , we determined the long-term decline in mortality and life expectancy without the combined effect of smoking , obesity , and alcohol . To this end , we used existing recent age- and sex-specific estimates of mortality after excluding the combined impact smoking , obesity , and alcohol ( Janssen et al . , 2021 ) , which we refer to as non-lifestyle-attributable mortality . Second , we projected this long-term underlying mortality decline into the future , while taking into account the mortality experiences of other populations . Specifically , we performed a Li–Lee coherent projection ( Li and Lee , 2005 ) of non-lifestyle-attributable mortality in which we regarded the high life expectancy values and more favourable long-term trends among women in France , Spain , and Italy as the values and trends towards which the other populations will converge , since we regard these three populations as forerunners . Third , we obtained future estimates of mortality attributable to smoking , obesity , and alcohol , which we refer to as lifestyle-attributable mortality . We did so by utilizing recently published projections of smoking- , obesity- , and alcohol-attributable mortality that were both data and theory driven ( Janssen et al . , 2020c; Janssen et al . , 2020b; Janssen et al . , 2020d ) . Fourth , we combined the projections of non-lifestyle-attributable mortality and lifestyle-attributable mortality by extending the approach that Janssen et al . developed for combining the separate projections of non-smoking- and smoking-attributable mortality ( Janssen et al . , 2013 ) . We applied our projection approach to the national populations of 18 European countries ( see Table 1 for the included countries ) using country , sex , and age-specific all-cause mortality and exposure data for the 1990–2014 period from the Human Mortality Database ( HMD and University of California , Berkeley ( USA ) , and Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research ( Germany ) , 2019 ) , and similar data for lifestyle-attributable mortality and non-lifestyle-attributable mortality from a recent study ( Janssen et al . , 2021 ) . We were restricted in both the starting year and the end year because lifestyle-attributable mortality data was available only for this period . We obtained estimates of life expectancy at birth ( e0 ) , including 95% projection intervals up to 2065 , by applying standard life table techniques to the projected mortality rates for ages 0–130 ( Preston et al . , 2001 ) . We focussed on life expectancy at birth because it is a very common summary measure of health , and the most common output measure of mortality forecasts . We have chosen a relatively large projection horizon ( 2015–2065 ) given the comparatively short historical time series available ( 1990–2014 ) to illustrate that our approach is able to generate reliable outcomes for the long-term future . We compared our projection outcomes with the outcomes of the benchmark Lee–Carter extrapolation ( Lee and Carter , 1992 ) applied to all-cause mortality and examined the separate effects of incorporating lifestyle factors , and of including the mortality experiences of other countries . We report the outcomes of additional projections and comparisons in the Results section ‘The differences explained’ . We also compared our outcomes to the official forecasts by Eurostat and United Nations ( see the Discussion section ‘Comparison with other projections’ ) . More detailed information on the data and methods can be found in Appendix 1 . 3 Results Over the 1990–2014 period , life expectancy at birth ( e0 ) increased , on average , across the 18 European countries studied by 6 . 6 years for men ( from 71 . 8 to 78 . 3 years ) and by 4 . 8 years for women ( from 78 . 6 to 83 . 4 years ) ( see Table 1 ) . These values translate into a yearly increase in e0 of 0 . 28 years for men and 0 . 20 years for women . This difference between men and women can largely be attributed to lifestyle factors . Without the impact of smoking , obesity , and alcohol , the increase in e0 over the 1990–2014 period was more similar between men ( 5 . 1 years; 0 . 21 annually ) and women ( 5 . 3 years; 0 . 22 annually ) . In addition , the increase in e0 was more similar between countries for non-lifestyle-attributable mortality ( variance: 0 . 5 for men , 0 . 6 for women ) than for all-cause mortality ( variance: 0 . 9 for men , 0 . 7 for women ) . The greater increase in e0 for all-cause mortality than for non-lifestyle-attributable mortality among men can be explained by the significant declines in lifestyle-attributable mortality men experienced ( see Figure 1 ) . These declines stemmed predominantly from large declines in smoking-attributable mortality ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) , after a period of sharp increases . In contrast , the past increases in lifestyle-attributable mortality among women were driven by increases in all three factors ( except alcohol in Eastern Europe ) ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ) and resulted in smaller increases in e0 for all-cause mortality than for non-lifestyle-attributable mortality . Figure 2 and Figure 2—figure supplement 1 show that whereas trends in e0 since 1950 have been rather unstable , the trends in e0 without lifestyle factors can be regarded as more stable . This is indicated by ( 1 ) the more stable trend in e0 for non-smoking-related mortality for men in the 1950s and 1960s , which seems to be in line with the more recent trends in e0 for non-lifestyle-attributable mortality and ( 2 ) the close correspondence among women between the recent trends in e0 for non-lifestyle-attributable mortality and the trends in e0 for all-cause mortality in the 1950s–1960s that were probably affected only minimally by lifestyle factors . We extrapolated the more universal and more stable mortality trends that we observed for non-lifestyle-attributable mortality , while assuming that the trends for men and women in the individual countries will eventually move towards the more favourable long-term trends for women in France , Spain , and Italy . We selected these populations as the forerunner populations in terms of life expectancy in Europe because they exhibit both very high recent e0 values and very favourable long-lasting past trends in e0 ( Stoeldraijer , 2019 ) . We added to these projections the projected levels of lifestyle-attributable mortality ( see Figure 1 ) . For men , the past declines in age-standardised lifestyle-attributable mortality fractions ( LAMF ) over the 1990–2014 period are projected to further decline until 2065 , albeit at a different pace than in the past . Among Eastern European men in particular , the decline is projected to decelerate . For women , we project that the past increases in LAMF will ( eventually ) turn into declines . Figure 1—figure supplements 1 and 2 show the projections of smoking- , obesity- , and alcohol-attributable mortality ( Janssen et al . , 2020c; Janssen et al . , 2020b; Janssen et al . , 2020d ) . The projections follow the observed wave-shaped dynamic of the smoking epidemic ( Lopez et al . , 1994; Janssen , 2020 ) and the hypothesised wave shape of the obesity epidemic ( Xu and Lam , 2018; Jaacks et al . , 2019 ) . For alcohol-attributable mortality , unrealistic future differences between countries were avoided by assuming that the current increases observed for selected countries will eventually turn into declines ( Janssen et al . , 2020d ) . We project that in the 18 European countries studied , life expectancy at birth will increase from , on average , 78 . 3 years for men and 83 . 4 years for women in 2014 to 90 . 5 years for men and 92 . 8 years for women in 2065 ( Table 2; Figure 3 ) . This represents an average increase per year of 0 . 24 years for men and 0 . 18 years for women . The projected increase is greater for men than for women because all-cause mortality levels are currently further away from non-lifestyle-attributable mortality levels for men than for women and because lifestyle-attributable mortality is higher among men than among women . There is , therefore , more room for improvement for men than for women . Compared to the average past increases ( 1990–2014 ) in e0 ( 0 . 28 years for men; 0 . 20 years for women ) , these projected increases are lower , particularly for men . This is because – as mentioned – the increase in e0 for men over the 1990–2014 period is actually an acceleration compared to the underlying trend in non-lifestyle-attributable mortality because of the decline in lifestyle-attributable mortality , predominantly in smoking-attributable mortality . The highest e0 in 2065 is projected for France among women ( 94 . 0 ) and for Italy among men ( 91 . 4 ) . Hungary is the country with the lowest projected e0 in 2065 , at 88 . 6 years among men and 91 . 0 years among women . These countries also had in 2014 , respectively , the ( second ) highest and the lowest values . We project the largest gains in life expectancy for Hungary and Poland , particularly among men , in line with past large increases in non-lifestyle-attributable mortality due to a process of catch-up ( Table 1 ) , and large projected declines in lifestyle-attributable mortality in these countries ( Figure 1 ) . Among women , we project large gains as well for Denmark and the United Kingdom , which can be attributed to their high current levels of lifestyle-attributable mortality , predominantly due to their high levels of smoking-attributable mortality , and the large projected ( continued ) declines therein ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ) . The smallest gains are projected for Switzerland , which could be related to the relatively small projected declines in lifestyle-attributable mortality resulting from a long projected continuation of increases in obesity prevalence . The sex difference in e0 is projected to decline from , on average , 5 . 0 years in 2014 to 2 . 3 years in 2065 ( Supplementary file 1A; Figure 3 ) . The gap is projected to be smallest in Greece , at 1 . 5 years; and largest in Slovenia , at 2 . 7 years . Among the explanations for the projected convergence of the sex gap in e0 is that the sex differences are smaller for non-lifestyle-attributable mortality than for all-cause mortality; the sex differences in lifestyle-attributable mortality are smaller in the long run; and our assumption that the trends in non-lifestyle-attributable mortality will converge . Compared to the benchmark Lee–Carter ( LC ) extrapolative mortality projection , our projection results in higher future e0 in 2065 for all populations under study ( Table 2 ) . On average , the projected e0 values in 2065 are 2 . 6 years higher for men and 2 . 1 years higher for women in our projection than in the individual Lee–Carter mortality projection , which projected e0 values of 87 . 9 years for men and 90 . 6 years for women in 2065 ( Table 2 ) . For men , particularly in Hungary , the differences between our projected values and those of the LC projection are considerable , mainly because of large projected declines in lifestyle-attributable mortality . Also for Dutch women a considerable difference between our projection and the LC projection can be observed . For Dutch women not only large declines in lifestyle-attributable mortality are projected , but they also experienced a more favourable trend in non-lifestyle-attributable mortality than in all-cause mortality . In addition , our projection results in smaller differences in future e0 between countries and sexes . That is , the LC projection projects that the variance between countries in e0 for 2065 is 3 . 8 years for men and 1 . 7 years for women , whereas in our projection , the expected variance is 0 . 6 years for both men and women ( Table 2 ) . In addition , Figure 3—figure supplement 1 illustrates that the LC projection , unlike our projection , can result in unlikely crossovers and divergences between countries ( e . g . , Greece and Hungary for men; the Netherlands and Slovenia for women ) . In addition , the sex difference in e0 in 2065 is projected to be 2 . 7 years in the LC projection , but 2 . 3 years in our projection ( Table 2 ) . Furthermore , a closer look at the sex differences projected by the LC projection ( Supplementary file 1A ) reveals large differences in the projected sex differences between countries ranging from 0 . 1 to 5 . 4 years . In our projection , by contrast , the range is between 1 . 5 and 2 . 7 years . The very small difference in e0 between women and men projected for 2065 in the Netherlands ( 0 . 1 years ) and in the United Kingdom ( 0 . 9 years ) indicates that the individual LC projection of all-cause mortality might result in an unlikely crossover between men and women in e0 in the long-term future due to the more favourable past trends in all-cause mortality among men than among women in the 1990–2014 period . Thus , our projection avoids an unlikely crossover in future life expectancy values between men and women . Moreover , unlike the LC mortality projection , our projection results in non-linear future increases in e0 ( Figure 3; Figure 3—figure supplement 2 ) . Particularly for men in Belgium , Greece , the Czech Republic , Hungary , and Poland , but also for women in Hungary , Denmark , and the United Kingdom , we see faster projected increases in life expectancy in the early decades , but slower increases in life expectancy further in the future , in line with the projections of lifestyle-attributable mortality . The LC projection , by contrast , anticipates more constant future increases in life expectancy at birth . The observed differences between our projection and the Lee–Carter projection can stem from either the lifestyle dimension , the coherent dimension , or both . Within the lifestyle dimension , two mechanisms apply: first , the projection of non-lifestyle mortality instead of all-cause mortality , and , second , the effect of projected lifestyle-attributable mortality itself . The higher values estimated by our projection than by the LC projection stem from both dimensions ( Table 2; Supplementary file 1B ) . The coherent dimension led to higher values because the French , Italian , and Spanish women combined exhibited more favourable trends in non-lifestyle-attributable mortality than the individual populations combined , after controlling for the underlying age pattern of mortality . The lifestyle dimension resulted in an additional effect , which was particularly large for women . For women , unlike for men , the past trends in non-lifestyle-attributable mortality were more favourable than the past trends in all-cause mortality . For both men and women , an additional positive effect emerges from the projected ( eventual ) decline in lifestyle-attributable mortality . The smaller projected differences between countries in our projection than in the LC projection also stem from both elements , although for men , the impact of integrating lifestyle is more pronounced ( Table 2; Supplementary file 1B ) . Particularly for men , the past trends in non-lifestyle-attributable mortality were much more similar between countries than the past trends in all-cause mortality . In addition , for both men and women , country differences in lifestyle-attributable mortality in 2065 are projected to be smaller than they are currently . The smaller sex differences in projected e0 values in our projection stem purely from the convergence dimension , whereas the nonlinearity of future trends in our projection stems completely from the lifestyle dimension . Figure 3—figure supplement 3 illustrates that the inclusion of the lifestyle dimension in the Lee–Carter projection ( thus ignoring the coherent dimension ) leads to a future e0 that is moving back upwards towards the future trend in e0 for non-lifestyle-attributable mortality . 4 Discussion An important element of our projection approach is the identification of the underlying long-term mortality trend that can be extrapolated into the future . We illustrated that past trends in non-lifestyle-attributable mortality serve this purpose better than past trends in all-cause mortality . For non-lifestyle-attributable mortality , the differences in past trends between countries and between men and women are smaller , and the trends are more robust . In contrast , the trends in all-cause mortality exhibit a wave-shaped fluctuation due to initial increases in smoking- , obesity- , and alcohol-attributable mortality , followed ( eventually ) by declines . This pattern leads , first , to a deceleration of increases in e0 , and a move away from the underlying increase in e0 in non-lifestyle attributable mortality , followed by an acceleration of increases in e0 , and a move back towards the underlying increase in e0 in non-lifestyle-attributable mortality . Thus , extrapolating past declines in all-cause mortality will lead to non-reliable outcomes: i . e . , the outcomes will be either too low when decelerating increases are extrapolated or too high when accelerating increases are extrapolated . Similarly , the extrapolation of past trends in all-cause mortality will result in non-robust outcomes , when updating the projection after a few years . Because the past trends in non-lifestyle-attributable mortality are more linear than the past trends in all-cause mortality , especially from a historical point of view , our projection is less dependent on the data period used for the extrapolation . Our finding of an average annual past increase in e0 for non-lifestyle-attributable mortality of 0 . 21 years for men and 0 . 22 years for women across the 18 European countries over the 1990–2014 period is lower than the continuous upward trend in record life expectancy of 0 . 243 years that Oeppen and Vaupel , 2002 observed over the 1840–2000 period . There are two main reasons . First , whereas record values always increase , the levels in individual countries may not , and since the 1990s , the record life expectancy has been observed for a non-European country ( Japan ) . Second , more recent increases in life expectancy are driven more by declines in mortality from chronic diseases at older ages with a less strong effect on life expectancy than from declines in mortality from infectious diseases at younger ages , which drove increases in life expectancy up to 1950 ( Omran , 1998; Vallin and Meslé , 2009 ) . As a result , a deceleration of increases in life expectancy over time is inevitable . Nonetheless , these large past increases in e0 for non-lifestyle-attributable mortality indicate that considerable increases in e0 are likely in the future . We applied a coherent mortality projection approach to past trends in non-lifestyle-attributable mortality . This resulted in more realistic estimates of the differences in future e0 values between countries and sexes than those of the individual Lee–Carter projection of past trends . Another added value of our inclusion of the mortality experiences of other countries in our projection is that it provided a broader empirical basis for the determination of the most likely future developments ( Janssen and Kunst , 2007 ) , which , in turn , improved the robustness of our projection outcomes ( Stoeldraijer , 2019 ) . However , next to a potential effect on the outcomes of the exact coherent methodology that is applied ( Stoeldraijer , 2019 ) , it is important to take into account the choice of the reference population ( Stoeldraijer , 2019; Booth and Tickle , 2008 ) . Using forerunner populations as the reference population , as advocated by among others Oeppen and Vaupel , 2002 and Bergeron-Boucher et al . , 2018 , instead of an average across many populations ( Li and Lee , 2005; Eurostat , 2020a ) will generally result in higher future life expectancy values ( see the next section as well ) . However , given that the past trend in e0 for non-lifestyle-attributable mortality is more equal between countries and sexes than the past trend in e0 for all-cause mortality ( see Table 1 ) , which reference populations are chosen will likely have a larger impact when coherently forecasting all-cause mortality than when coherently forecasting non-lifestyle-attributable mortality ( see also Janssen and Kunst , 2007 and Janssen et al . , 2013 ) . In addition , our convergence assumption relies on – at least – a continuation of improvements in socio-economic developments and medical care . Such continued improvements depend on continued investments in these areas , including diminishing socio-economic inequalities , better preparations for additional possible outbreaks of infectious diseases , and for the potential harmful effects of climate change . Although this might be considered optimistic , our assumption is supported by evidence that life expectancy has long followed a continuously increasing trend ( Oeppen and Vaupel , 2002 ) , and that this trend is even stronger from a historical perspective if the effects of lifestyle factors are excluded ( see the description of Figure 2 and its supplement in the Results section ) . To the projected long-term trend in non-lifestyle-attributable mortality , we added estimates of how smoking- , obesity- , and alcohol-attributable mortality are likely to develop in the near future – and , consequently , how long it will take before all-cause mortality trends again follow more closely the underlying trends in non-lifestyle-attributable mortality . We generated these estimates based on previously projected age-specific smoking- , obesity- , and alcohol-attributable mortality ( Janssen et al . , 2020c; Janssen et al . , 2020b; Janssen et al . , 2020d ) . To avoid generating unrealistic outcomes for the ( long-term ) future ( e . g . , continuing increases in smoking-attributable mortality for women , in obesity-attributable mortality , and in alcohol-attributable mortality in the few Eastern European countries where it is still increasing ) , the projections were based on advanced approaches that did not simply extrapolate past trends , but also took into account knowledge about the future progression of smoking- , alcohol- , and obesity-attributable mortality . Nonetheless , the projection of lifestyle-attributable mortality involves more subjectivity than the extrapolation of non-lifestyle-attributable mortality ( see Janssen et al . , 2020c; Janssen et al . , 2020b; Janssen et al . , 2020d for a critical evaluation ) . For example , in the separate projections of smoking- , obesity- , and alcohol-attributable mortality , population-specific lower bounds were implemented to avoid unlikely future estimates of zero smoking , obesity , and alcohol prevalence , in line with the theory ( Lopez et al . , 1994; Xu and Lam , 2018 ) , and to prevent unlikely crossovers between sexes and between countries in alcohol-attributable mortality . This approach could be considered conservative . On the other hand , however , the use of a wave-shaped pattern for obesity , and the large declines in alcohol-attributable mortality we project for Eastern European countries , could be considered too optimistic . However , in our view , the added value of integrating lifestyle into mortality projections outweighs the uncertainties that come with it . First , trends in non-lifestyle-attributable mortality provide a better approximation of the underlying mortality trend . Second , our projection is driven not only by data , but also by theory , and is preceded by a careful study of past trends . Third , by distinguishing between the underlying mortality trend and the additional effect of the three lifestyle factors combined , these projections provide much greater transparency and insight than a mere mechanical extrapolation of past trends could . Fourth , our approach resulted in more realistic differences between countries and sexes than those projected by other approaches ( see the next section as well ) . The abovementioned four added values of our mortality projection approach can be clearly linked to important criteria for evaluating the performance of mortality forecasts in addition to accuracy: namely , robustness , plausibility , reasonableness , and transparency ( Cairns et al . , 2009 ) . Moreover , the outcomes of our projection approach – which rely above all on the coherent projection of non-lifestyle-attributable mortality – are less dependent on the explicit choices that underlie general mortality forecasts ( e . g . , the choice of the forerunner populations and the historical time period ) . Compared to the benchmark Lee–Carter mortality extrapolation , our projection approach results in higher e0 in the long run; smaller differences in future e0 between countries and sexes; and non-linear future increases in e0 , in line with the shift towards the higher e0 values for non-lifestyle-attributable mortality . Moreover , compared to the most recent official mortality forecast by Eurostat , 2020a and the United Nations , 2020 , our mortality projection resulted in substantially higher projected e0 values in 2065 ( Supplementary file 1C ) . Our values were , on average , 5 . 0 years higher for men and 3 . 2 years ( Eurostat ) and 4 . 3 years ( UN ) higher for women . The UN projects very large and unrealistic differences in future life expectancy between countries and sexes , including higher projected life expectancy for men than for women in a number of countries . These outcomes clearly show the added value of adopting a coherent mortality projection approach . While Eurostat has performed a coherent mortality projection , it used a different methodology . Eurostat made a partial convergence assumption , applied to men and women separately , and considered the aggregate all-cause mortality of 12 countries ( Belgium , Denmark , Germany , Spain , France , Italy , the Netherlands , Austria , Portugal , Finland , Sweden , and the United Kingdom ) as the target ( Lanzieri , 2009; Eurostat , 2020b ) . In addition , Eurostat did not integrate the role of lifestyle factors . The added value of our projection approach over pure coherent mortality forecasting is that we projected the more robust past trends in non-lifestyle-attributable mortality rather than in all-cause mortality , and we projected non-linear future trends in line with the projection of lifestyle-attributable mortality . The reason why coherent mortality projections have to be applied to non-lifestyle-attributable mortality rather than to all-cause mortality is that there are important differences in smoking- , obesity- , and alcohol-attributable mortality trends between countries and sexes ( Janssen , 2020; Vidra et al . , 2019; Janssen et al . , 2020d ) . Among the advantages of taking the effects of obesity and alcohol in addition to those of smoking into account is that e0 values for non-lifestyle-attributable mortality are higher than e0 values for non-smoking-attributable mortality ( Figure 2 , Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) , and thus have the potential for larger future increases . In addition , as was illustrated , the effects of both obesity-attributable mortality and alcohol-attributable mortality ( particularly among Eastern European men ) on past and future life expectancy trends are large . All in all , the outcomes of our projection approach , which simultaneously takes into account the lifestyle factors smoking , obesity and alcohol , and the mortality experiences of forerunner populations , can be considered more realistic , more robust , and more insightful than previous extrapolative mortality projections , including those by the United Nations and Eurostat . Our approach , which distinguishes between the underlying long-term mortality decline and the remaining factors that cause deviations from this mortality decline , could also be adopted to account for the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mortality and life expectancy . First , it would be illogical to extrapolate the mortality trends up to 2020 to obtain life expectancy estimates for 2021 and beyond , because life expectancy in 2020 has been importantly negatively affected by COVID-19 ( Marois et al . , 2020 ) , and will likely to continue to do so for at least 2021 . This effect cannot be predicted using a simple extrapolation approach . Second , the underlying long-term mortality decline is argued not to be affected by COVID-19 ( e . g . , Stoeldraijer , 2020 ) , in line with the predominant temporal dip in life expectancy as a result of the Spanish flu in 1918 ( see Roser , 2020 ) . Although , as mentioned , the continuation of the underlying long-term mortality decline does depend on important investments to achieve continued improvements in socio-economic developments and medical care . Our findings of higher projected life expectancy values than those estimated by the benchmark Lee–Carter mortality projection and the official mortality forecasts by Eurostat and the United Nations have important implications for society . First , individuals could consider planning their life course ( e . g . , education , work ) differently given their longer expected lifespan . Second , a higher projected life expectancy suggests that there will be more older people in the population , which will likely bring both opportunities ( e . g . , an experienced workforce ) and challenges in terms of healthcare planning and social security . Our results imply that either the pension age will have to be raised or , if it is not , that the capital requirements of pension providers will need to be increased . For determining the pension age based on projected life expectancy , a projection that is more robust will have significant added value . More generally , having a more stable projection of mortality will allow for more robust population forecasts . In addition , our findings of ( 1 ) higher projected life expectancy values than those currently used in most mortality projection methodologies and ( 2 ) of a rather robust long-term increase in e0 after the effects of smoking , obesity , and alcohol are controlled for , indicate that a limit to human life expectancy ( average lifespan ) is not within reach – an issue that continues to spark scientific debate ( see the first paragraph of the introduction ) . Some of our original data regarding lifestyle-attributable mortality were based on previous publications , which , in turn , used data that are openly available . The all-cause mortality data and the exposure data can be obtained through the Human Mortality Database . We have provided source data files for all our tables and figures . These comprise the numerical data that are represented in the different figures , and the output on which the different tables are based . In addition , one excel file with all the final numerical/output data that were used as input for the tables and figures will be made available at the Open Science Framework: https://osf . io/ghu45/ . In addition , we will upload there the underlying observed age-specific mortality rates ( all-cause mortality , non-lifestyle-attributable mortality , lifestyle-attributable mortality ) as well as the adjusted and projected age-specific mortality rates ( medians and 90% and 95% projection intervals ) . The different R codes used for the different steps of the data analyses will be shared – as well – through the Open Science Framework link above ."}

Yet , the growing ageing population of most developed countries presents challenges to healthcare systems and government finances . For many older people , long periods of ill health are part of the end of life , and so a better understanding of ageing could offer the opportunity to prolong healthy living into old age . Ageing is complex and takes a long time to study – a lifetime in fact . This makes it difficult to discern its causes , among the countless possibilities based on an individual’s genes , behaviour or environment . While thousands of regions in an individual’s genetic makeup are known to influence their risk of different diseases , those that affect how long they will live have proved harder to disentangle . Timmers et al . sought to pinpoint such regions , and then use this information to predict , based on their DNA , whether someone had a better or worse chance of living longer than average . The DNA of over 500 , 000 people was read to reveal the specific ‘genetic fingerprints’ of each participant . Then , after asking each of the participants how long both of their parents had lived , Timmers et al . pinpointed 12 DNA regions that affect lifespan . Five of these regions were new and had not been linked to lifespan before . Across the twelve as a whole several were known to be involved in Alzheimer’s disease , smoking-related cancer or heart disease . Looking at the entire genome , Timmers et al . could then predict a lifespan score for each individual , and when they sorted participants into ten groups based on these scores they found that top group lived five years longer than the bottom , on average . Many factors beside genetics influence how long a person will live and our lifespan cannot be read from our DNA alone . Nevertheless , Timmers et al . had hoped to narrow down their search and discover specific genes that directly influence how quickly people age , beyond diseases . If such genes exist , their effects were too small to be detected in this study . The next step will be to expand the study to include more participants , which will hopefully pinpoint further genomic regions and help disentangle the biology of ageing and disease .", "article": "1 Introduction Human lifespan is a highly complex trait , the product of myriad factors involving health , lifestyle , genetics , environment , and chance . The extent of the role of genetic variation in human lifespan has been widely debated ( van den Berg et al . , 2017 ) , with estimates of broad sense heritability ranging from around 25% based on twin studies ( Ljungquist et al . , 1998; Herskind et al . , 1996; McGue et al . , 1993 ) ( perhaps over-estimated [Young et al . , 2018] ) to around 16 . 1% , ( narrow sense 12 . 2% ) based on large-scale population data ( Kaplanis et al . , 2018 ) . One very recent study suggests it is much lower still ( <7% ) ( Ruby et al . , 2018 ) , pointing to assortative mating as the source of resemblance amongst kin . Despite this modest heritability , extensive research has gone into genome-wide association studies ( GWAS ) finding genetic variants influencing human survival , using a variety of trait definitions and study designs ( Deelen et al . , 2011; Sebastiani et al . , 2012; Beekman et al . , 2013; Broer et al . , 2015; Joshi et al . , 2016; Pilling et al . , 2016; Zeng et al . , 2016; Pilling et al . , 2017 ) . GWAS have primarily focused on extreme cases of long-livedness ( longevity ) – individuals surviving past a certain age threshold – and scanning for differences in genetic variation from controls . While this case-control design has the advantage of focusing on highly statistically-informative individuals , who also often exhibit extreme healthspan and have potentially unique genetic attributes ( Sebastiani et al . , 2013; Sebastiani et al . , 2016 ) , the exceptional nature of the phenotype precludes collection of large samples , and differences in definitions of longevity complicate meta-analysis . As a result , only two robustly replicated , genome-wide significant associations ( near APOE and FOXO3 ) have been made to date ( Broer et al . , 2015; Deelen et al . , 2014 ) . An alternative approach is to study lifespan as a quantitative trait in the general population and use survival models ( such as Cox proportional hazards [Cox , 1972] ) to allow long-lived survivors to inform analysis . However , given the incidence of mortality in middle-aged subjects is low , studies have shifted to the use of parental lifespans with subject genotypes ( an instance of Wacholder’s kin-cohort method [Wacholder et al . , 1998] ) , circumventing the long wait associated with studying age at death in a prospective study ( Joshi et al . , 2016; Pilling et al . , 2016 ) . In addition , the recent increase in genotyped population cohorts around the world , and in particular the creation of UK Biobank ( Bycroft et al . , 2017 ) , has raised GWAS sample sizes to hundreds of thousands of individuals , providing the statistical power necessary to detect genetic effects on mortality . A third approach is to gather previously published GWAS on risk factors thought to possibly affect lifespan , such as smoking behaviour and cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , and estimate their actual independent , causal effects on mortality using Mendelian Randomisation . These causal estimates can then be used in a Bayesian framework to inform previously observed SNP associations with lifespan ( McDaid et al . , 2017 ) . Here , we blend these three approaches to studying lifespan and perform the largest GWAS on human lifespan to date . First , we leverage data from UK Biobank and 26 independent European-heritage population cohorts ( Joshi et al . , 2017 ) to carry out a GWAS of parental survival , quantified using Cox models . We then supplement this with data from 58 GWAS on mortality risk factors to conduct a Bayesian prior-informed GWAS ( iGWAS ) . Finally , we use publicly available case-control longevity GWAS statistics to compare the genetics of lifespan and longevity and provide collective replication of our lifespan GWAS results . We also examine the diseases associated with lifespan-altering variants and the effect of known disease variants on lifespan , to provide insight into the interplay between lifespan and disease . Finally , we use our GWAS results to implicate specific genes , biological pathways , and cell types , and use our findings to create and test whole-genome polygenic scores for survival . 2 Results We carried out GWAS of survival in a sample of 1 , 012 , 240 parents ( 60% deceased ) of European ancestry from UK Biobank and a previously published meta-analysis of 26 additional population cohorts ( LifeGen [Joshi et al . , 2017]; Table 1—source data 1 ) . We performed a sex-stratified analysis and then combined the allelic effects in fathers and mothers into a single parental survival association in two ways . First , we assumed genetic variants with common effect sizes ( CES ) for both parents , maximising power if the effect is indeed the same . Second , we allowed for sex-specific effect sizes ( SSE ) , maximising power to detect sexually dimorphic variants , including those only affecting one sex . The latter encompasses a conventional sex-stratified analysis , but uses only one statistical test for the much more general alternative hypothesis that there is an effect in at least one sex . We find 12 genomic regions with SNPs passing genome-wide significance for one or both analyses ( p < 2 . 5 × 10–8 , accounting for the two tests CES/SSE ) ( Figure 1; Table 1 ) . Among these are five loci discovered here for the first time , at or near MAGI3 , KCNK3 , HTT , HP , and LDLR . Carrying one copy of a life-extending allele is associated with an increase in lifespan between 0 . 23 and 1 . 07 years ( around 3 to 13 months ) . Despite our sample size exceeding 1 million phenotypes , a variant had to have a minor allele frequency exceeding 5% and an effect size of 0 . 35 years of life or more per allele for our study to detect it with 80% power . We also attempted to validate novel lifespan SNPs discovered by Pilling et al . ( 2017 ) in UK Biobank at an individual level by using the LifeGen meta-analysis as independent replication sample . Testing 20 candidate SNPs for which we had data available , we find directionally consistent , nominally significant associations for six loci ( p < 0 . 05 , one-sided test ) , of which three have sex-specific effects . We also provide evidence against three putative loci but lack statistical power to assess the remaining 11 ( Figure 2 , Figure 2—source data 1 ) . We then used our full sample to test six candidate SNPs previously associated with longevity ( Zeng et al . , 2016; Deelen et al . , 2014; Flachsbart et al . , 2009; Sebastiani et al . , 2017 ) for association with lifespan , and find directionally consistent evidence for SNPs near FOXO3 and EBF1 . The remaining SNPs did not associate with lifespan despite apparently adequate power to detect any effect similar to that originally reported ( Figure 2 , Figure 2—source data 1 ) . Finally , we tested a deletion , d3-GHR , reported to affect male lifespan by 10 years when homozygous ( Ben-Avraham et al . , 2017 ) by converting its effect size to one we expect to observe when fitting an additive model . We used a SNP tagging the deletion and estimated the expected effect size in a linear regression for the ( postulated ) recessive effect across the three genotypes , given their frequency ( see Materials and methods ) . While this additive model reduces power relative to the correct model , our large sample size is more than able to offset the loss of power , and we find evidence d3-GHR does not associate with lifespan with any ( recessive or additive ) effect similar to that originally reported ( Figure 2 , Figure 2—source data 1 ) . We integrated 58 publicly available GWAS on mortality risk factors with our CES lifespan GWAS , creating Bayesian priors for each SNP effect based on causal effect estimates of 16 independent risk factors on lifespan . These included body mass index , blood biochemistry , CVD , type 2 diabetes , schizophrenia , multiple sclerosis , education levels , and smoking traits . The integrated analysis reveals an additional seven genome-wide significant associations with lifespan ( Bayes Factor permutation p < 2 . 5 × 10–8 ) , of which SNPs near TMEM18 , GBX2/ASB18 , IGF2R , POM12C , ZC3HC1 , and ABO are reported at genome-wide significance for the first time ( Figure 3; Table 2 ) . A total of 82 independent SNPs associate with lifespan when allowing for a 1% false discovery rate ( FDR ) ( Table 2—source data 2 ) . As has become increasingly common ( Pilling et al . , 2017 ) , we attempted to replicate our genome-wide significant findings collectively , rather than individually . This is usually done by constructing polygenic risk scores from genotypic information in an independent cohort and testing for association with the trait of interest subject-by-subject . We used publicly available summary statistics on extreme longevity as an independent replication dataset ( Broer et al . , 2015; Deelen et al . , 2014 ) , but lacking individual data from such studies , we calculated the collective effect of lifespan SNPs on longevity using the same method as inverse-variance meta-analysis two-sample Mendelian randomisation ( MR ) using summary statistics ( Hemani et al . , 2018 ) , which gives equivalent results . Prior to doing this , all effects observed in the external longevity studies were converted to hazard ratios using the APOE variant effect size as an empirical conversion factor , to allow the longevity studies to be meta-analysed despite their different study designs ( and to be adjusted for sample overlap; see Materials and methods ) . Although the focus is on collective replication , our method has the advantage of transparency at an individual variant level , which is of particular importance for researchers seeking to follow-up individual loci . Remarkably , all lead lifespan variants show directional consistency with the independent longevity sample , and 4 SNPs or close proxies ( r2 > 0 . 8 ) reach nominal replication ( p < 0 . 05 , one-sided test ) ( Figure 4—source data 1 ) . Of these , SNPs near ABO , ZC3HC1 , and IGF2R are replicated for the first time , and thus appear to affect overall survival and survival to extreme age . The overall ratio of replication effect sizes to discovery effect sizes – excluding APOE – is 0 . 42 ( 95% CI 0 . 23–0 . 61; p = 1 . 35 × 10−5 ) . The fact this ratio is significantly greater than zero indicates most lifespan SNPs are indeed longevity SNPs . However , the fact most SNPs have a ratio smaller than one indicates they may affect early mortality more than survival to extreme age , relative to APOE ( which itself has a greater effect on late-life mortality than early mortality ) ( Figure 4 ) . We stratified our UK Biobank sample ( for which we had individual level data ) by sex and age bands to identify sex- and age-specific effects for survival SNPs discovered and/or replicated in this study . Although power was limited , as we sought contrasts in small effect sizes , we find 5 SNPs with differential effects on lifespan when stratified ( FDR 5% across the 24 variants considered ) . The effect of the APOE variant increases with age: the ε4 log hazard ratio on individuals older than 70 years is around 3 times greater than those between ages 40–70 . In contrast , the effect of lead variants near CHRNA3/5 , CDKN2B-AS1 , and ABO tends to decline after age 60 , at least when expressed as hazard ratios ( Figure 5A ) . Independent of age , lead variants near APOE and PSORS1C3 also show an effect ( lnHR ) of 0 . 036; 0 . 038 greater in women ( 95% CI 0 . 013–0 . 059; 0 . 019–0 . 056 , respectively ) , compared to men ( Figure 5B ) . Notably , the SNP near ZW10 , which was identified by Pilling et al . ( 2017 ) in fathers , and which replicated in LifeGen fathers , may affect men and women equally ( 95% CI years gained per effect allele , men 0 . 17–0 . 42 , women 0 . 04–0 . 31 ) , as measured in our meta-analysis of UK Biobank and LifeGen . We used SMR-HEIDI to look for causal effects of gene expression or changes in methylation on lifespan within the 24 loci discovered or replicated in our study . Using blood eQTL summary statistics from two studies ( Westra et al . , 2013; Lloyd-Jones et al . , 2017 ) , we suggest causal roles for expression of PSRC1 , SESN1 , SH2B3 , PSMA4 , FURIN , FES , and KANK2 at 5% FDR ( Supplementary file 1 ) . GTEx tissue-wide expression data suggests further roles for 16 genes across 24 tissues , especially FES ( nine tissues ) , PMS2P3 ( six tissues ) and PSORS1C1 ( four tissues ) . Methylation data reveals roles for 44 CpG sites near nine loci , especially near the PSORS1C3 locus ( 21 sites ) , APOE locus ( nine sites ) , and HLA-DQA1 locus ( four sites ) ( Supplementary file 2 ) . We next used SOJO to perform conditional analysis on the same loci to find additional independent variants associated with lifespan . We find substantial allelic heterogeneity in several association intervals and identify an additional 335 variants , which increase out-of-sample explained variance from 0 . 095% to 0 . 169% ( 78% increase ) . CELSR2/PSRC1 , KCNK3 , HLA-DQA1 , LPA , ZW10 , FURIN/FES , and APOE are amongst the most heterogeneous loci with at least 25 variants per locus showing independent effects ( Supplementary file 3 ) . We next sought to understand the link between our lifespan variants and disease . We looked up known associations with our top hits and proxies ( r2 > 0 . 6 ) in the GWAS catalog ( MacArthur et al . , 2017 ) and PhenoScanner ( Staley et al . , 2016 ) , excluding loci identified in iGWAS as these used disease associations to build the effect priors . We also excluded trait associations discovered solely in UK Biobank , as the overlap with our sample could result in spurious association due to correlations between morbidity and mortality . Under these restrictions , we find alleles which increase lifespan associate with a reduction in cardiometabolic , autoimmune , smoking-related , and neuropsychiatric disease and their disease risk factors ( Table 1 , Table 1—source data 3 ) . None of the loci show any association with cancer other than lung cancer . We then looked up associations of the 81 iGWAS SNPs ( 1% FDR ) with the risk factor GWAMAs used to inform the prior . While associations are a priori limited to the risk factors included in the iGWAS , the pattern of association is still of interest . We find loci show strong clustering in either blood lipids or CVD , show moderate clustering of metabolic and neurological traits , and show weak but highly pleiotropic clustering amongst most of the remaining traits ( see Figure 3—figure supplement 1 for clustering of genome-wide significant SNPs ) . In order to study the relative contribution of diseases to lifespan , we approached the question from the other end and looked up known associations for disease categories ( CVD , type 2 diabetes , neurological disease , smoking-related traits , and cancers ) in large numbers ( >20 associations in each category ) from the GWAS catalog ( MacArthur et al . , 2017 ) and used our GWAS to see if the disease loci associate with lifespan . Our measure was lifespan variance explained ( LVE , years2 [Ljungquist et al . , 1998] ) by the locus , which balances effect size against frequency , and is proportional to selection response and the GWAS test statistic and thus monotonic for risk of false positive lifespan associations . Taking each independent disease variant , we ordered them by LVE , excluding any secondary disease where the locus was pleiotropic . The Alzheimer’s disease locus APOE shows the largest LVE ( 0 . 23 years2 ) , consistent with its most frequent discovery as a lifespan SNP in GWAS ( Joshi et al . , 2016; Pilling et al . , 2017; Deelen et al . , 2014; Deelen et al . , 2013 ) . Of the 20 largest LVE SNPs , 12 and 4 associate with CVD and smoking/lung cancer , respectively , while only two associate with other cancers ( near ZW10 and NRG1; neither in the top 15 LVE SNPs ) . Cumulatively , the top 20/45 LVE SNPs explain 0 . 33/0 . 43 years2 through CVD , 0 . 13/0 . 15 years2 through smoking and lung cancer , and 0 . 03/0 . 11 years2 through other cancers ( Figure 6 ) . Strikingly , two of the three largest LVE loci for non-lung cancers ( at or near ATXN2/BRAP and CDKN2B-AS1 ) show increased cancer protection associating with decreased lifespan ( due to antagonistic pleiotropy with CVD ) , while the third ( at or near MAGI3 ) also shows evidence of pleiotropy , having an association with CVD three times as strong as breast cancer , and in the same direction . In addition , 6 out of the 11 remaining cancer-protective loci which increase lifespan and pass FDR ( near ZW10 , NRG1 , C6orf106 , HNF1A , C20orf187 , and ABO ) also show significant associations with CVD but could not be tested for pleiotropy as we did not have data on the relative strength of association of every type of cancer against CVD , and thus ( conservatively from the point of view of our conclusion ) remain counted as cancer SNPs ( Figure 7 , Figure 7—source data 1 ) . Visual inspection also reveals an interesting pattern in the SNPs that did not pass FDR correction for affecting lifespan: cardio-protective variants associate almost exclusively with increased lifespan , while cancer-protective variants appear to associate with lifespan in either direction ( grey dots often appear below the x-axis for other cancers ) . Together , the disease loci included in our study with significant effects on lifespan explain 0 . 95 years2 , or less than 1% of the phenotypic variance of lifespan of European parents in UK Biobank ( 123 years2 ) , and around 5% of the heritability . We used stratified LD-score regression to assess whether cell type-specific regions of the genome are enriched for lifespan variants . As this method derives its power from SNP heritability , we limited the analysis to genomically British individuals in UK Biobank , which showed the lowest heterogeneity and the highest SNP heritability . At an FDR < 5% , we find enrichment in SNP heritability in five categories: two histone and two chromatin marks linked to male and female foetal brain cells , and one histone mark linked to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPC ) of the brain . Despite testing other cell types , such as heart , liver , and immune cells , no other categories are statistically significant after multiple testing correction ( Supplementary file 4 ) . We also determined which biological pathways could explain the associations between our genetic variants and lifespan using three different methods , VEGAS , PASCAL , and DEPICT . VEGAS highlights 33 gene sets at an FDR < 5% , but neither PASCAL nor DEPICT ( with SNP thresholds at p < 5 × 10–8 and p < 1 × 10–5 ) identify any gene sets passing multiple testing correction . The 33 gene sets highlighted by VEGAS are principally for blood lipid metabolism ( 21 ) , with the majority involving lipoproteins ( 14 ) or homeostasis ( 4 ) . Other noteworthy gene sets are neurological structure and function ( 5 ) and vesicle-mediated transport ( 3 ) . Enrichment was also found for organic hydroxy compound transport , macromolecular complex remodelling , signalling events mediated by stem cell factor receptor ( c-kit ) , and regulation of amyloid precursor protein catabolism ( Supplementary file 5 ) . Finally , we performed an analysis to assess whether genes that have been shown to change their expression with age ( Peters et al . , 2015 ) are likely to have a causal effect on lifespan itself . Starting with a set of independent SNPs affecting gene expression ( eQTLs ) , we created categories based on whether gene expression was age-dependent and whether the SNP was associated with lifespan in our study ( at varying levels of significance ) . We find eQTLs associated with lifespan are 1 . 69 to 3 . 39 times more likely to have age-dependent gene expression , depending on the P value threshold used to define the set of lifespan SNPs ( Supplementary file 6 ) . We calculated polygenic risk scores ( PRS ) for lifespan for two subsamples of UK Biobank ( Scottish individuals and a random selection of English/Welsh individuals ) , and one sample from the Estonian Biobank . The PRS were based on ( recalculated ) lifespan GWAS summary statistics that excluded these samples to ensure independence between training and testing datasets . When including all independent markers , we find an increase of one standard deviation in PRS increases lifespan by 0 . 8 to 1 . 1 years , after doubling observed parent effect sizes to compensate for the imputation of their genotypes ( see Table 3—source data 1 for a comparison of performance of different PRS thresholds ) . Correspondingly – again after doubling for parental imputation – we find a difference in median survival for the top and bottom deciles of PRS of 5 . 6/5 . 6 years for Scottish fathers/mothers , 6 . 4/4 . 8 for English and Welsh fathers/mothers and 3 . 0/2 . 8 for Estonian fathers/mothers . In the Estonian Biobank , where data is available for a wider range of subject ages ( i . e . beyond median survival age ) we find a contrast of 3 . 5/2 . 7 years in survival for male/female subjects , across the PRS tenth to first deciles ( Table 3 , Figure 8 ) . Finally , as we did for individual variants , we looked at the age- and sex-specific nature of the PRS on parental lifespan and then tested for associations with ( self-reported ) age-related diseases in subjects and their kin . We find a high PRS has a larger protective effect on lifespan for mothers than fathers in UK Biobank subsamples ( p = 0 . 0071 ) , and has a larger protective effect on lifespan in younger age bands ( p = 0 . 0001 ) ( Figure 9 ) , although in both cases , it should be borne in mind that women and younger people have a lower baseline hazard , so a greater improvement in hazard ratio does not necessarily mean a larger absolute protection . We find that overall , higher PRS scores ( i . e . genetically longer life ) are associated with less heart disease , diabetes , hypertension , respiratory disease and lung cancer , but increased prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease , Parkinson’s disease , prostate cancer and breast cancer , the last three primarily in parents . We find no association between the score and prevalence of cancer in subjects . ( Figure 10 ) . 3 Discussion Applying the kin-cohort method in a GWAS and mortality risk factor iGWAS across UK Biobank and the LifeGen meta-analysis , we identified 11 novel genome-wide significant associations with lifespan and replicated six previously discovered loci . We also replicated long-standing longevity SNPs near APOE , FOXO3 , and 5q33 . 3/EBF1 – albeit with smaller effect sizes in the latter two cases – but found evidence of no association ( at effect sizes originally published ) with lifespan for more recently published longevity SNPs near IL6 , ANKRD20A9P , USP42 , and TMTC2 . Conversely , all individual variants identified in our analyses showed directionally consistent effects in a meta-analysis of two European-ancestry studies of extreme longevity , and a test of association of a polygenic risk score of the variants was highly significant in the longevity dataset ( p < 1 . 5 × 10−5 ) . Our findings validate the results of a previous Bayesian analysis performed on a subset ( N = 116 , 279 ) of the present study’s discovery sample ( McDaid et al . , 2017 ) , which highlighted two loci which are now genome-wide significant in conventional GWAS in the present study’s larger sample . iGWAS thus appears to be an effective method able to identify lifespan-associated variants in smaller samples than standard GWAS , albeit relying on known biology . With the curious exception of a locus near HTT ( the Huntington's disease gene ) , all lead SNPs are known to associate with autoimmune , cardiometabolic , neuropsychiatric , or smoking-related disease , and it is plausible these are the major pathways through which the variants affect lifespan . Whole-genome polygenic risk scores showed similar associations with disease , excluding late-onset disorders such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s , where polygenic risk scores for extended lifespan increased risk ( of survival to age at onset ) of the disease . Genetic variants affecting lifespan were enriched for pathways involving the transport , homeostasis and metabolism of lipoprotein particles , validating previous reports ( McDaid et al . , 2017 ) . We also identified new pathways including vesicle transport , metabolism of acylglycerol and sterols , and synaptic and dendritic function . We discovered genomic regions with epigenetic marks determining cell differentiation into foetal brain and DLPC cells were enriched for genetic variants affecting lifespan . Finally , we showed that we can use our GWAS results to construct a polygenic risk score , which makes 3 to 5 year distinctions in life expectancy at birth between individuals from the score’s top and bottom deciles . Despite studying over 1 million lives , our standard GWAS only identified 12 variants influencing lifespan at genome-wide significance . This contrasts with height ( another highly polygenic trait ) where a study of around 250 , 000 individuals by Wood et al . , 2014 . found 423 loci . This difference can partly be explained by the much lower heritability of lifespan ( 0 . 12; Kaplanis et al . , 2018 ) ( cf . 0 . 8 for height [Wood et al . , 2014] ) , consistent with evolution having a stronger influence on the total heritability of traits more closely related to fitness and limiting effect sizes . In addition , the use of indirect genotypes ( the kin-cohort method ) reduces the effective sample size to 1/4 for the parent-offspring design . When considering these limitations , we calculate our study was equal in power to a height study of only around 23 , 224 individuals , were lifespan to have a similar genetic architecture to height ( see Materials and methods ) . Under this assumption , we would require a sample size of around 10 million parents ( or equivalently 445 , 000 nonagenarian cases , with even more controls ) to detect a similar number of loci as Wood et al . At the same time , our inability to replicate several previous borderline significant longevity and lifespan findings suggests research into survival in general requires substantial increases in power to robustly identify loci . Meta-analysis of mothers and fathers , permitting common or sex-specific effect sizes , of course , doubled effective sample size , with slight attenuation to reflect the observed correlation ( ~10% ) between father and mother traits ( consistent with previous studies [Kaplanis et al . , 2018] ) . This correlation indicates the presence of assortative mating on traits which correlate with lifespan ( as lifespan itself is of course not observed until later ) , or post-pairing environmental convergence . We note that in principle , assortative mating could lead to allelic correlations at causal loci for the contributing traits , causing departures from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium , and increasing the genotypic variance and thus power to detect association . However , in practice , at least for lifespan , the effects are too small for the effect to be material . The association of lifespan variants with well-known , life-shortening diseases ( cardiovascular , autoimmune , smoking-related diseases and lung cancer; Mathers et al . , 2018 ) is not surprising , but the paucity of associations with other forms of cancer – without pleiotropic effects on CVD – is . This paucity suggests cancer deaths may often be due to ( perhaps many ) rarer variants or environmental exposures , although effect sizes might simply be slightly below our cut-off threshold to detect . Disappointingly , the variants and pathways we identified do not appear to underpin a generalised form of ageing independent of disease . Our finding that lifespan genetics are enriched for lipid metabolism genes is in line with expectations , given lipid metabolites – especially cholesterol metabolites – have well-established effects on atherosclerosis , type 2 diabetes , Alzheimer’s disease , osteoporosis , and age-related cancers ( Zarrouk et al . , 2014 ) . Pilling et al . ( 2017 ) implicated nicotinic acetylcholine receptor pathways in human lifespan , which we detected at nominal significance ( p = 2 × 10−4 ) but not at 5% FDR correction ( q = 0 . 0556 ) . Instead we highlighted more general synapse and dendrite pathways and identified foetal brain and DLPC cells as important in ageing . The DLPC is involved in smoking addiction ( Hayashi et al . , 2013 ) , dietary self-control ( Lowe et al . , 2014 ) , and is susceptible to neurodegeneration ( Morrison and Baxter , 2012 ) , which could explain why genetic variation for lifespan is specifically enriched in these cells , mediated through smoking-related , cardiometabolic , and neuropsychiatric disease . Much work has been done implicating FOXO3 as an ageing gene in model organisms ( Kenyon et al . , 1993; Hwangbo et al . , 2004 ) , however we found the association in humans at that locus may be driven by expression of SESN1 ( admittedly a finding restricted to peripheral blood tissue ) . SESN1 is a gene connected to the FOXO3 promoter via chromatin interactions and is involved in the response to reactive oxygen species and mTORC1 inhibition ( Donlon et al . , 2017 ) . While fine-mapping studies have specifically found genetic variation within the locus causes differential expression of FOXO3 itself ( Flachsbart et al . , 2017; Grossi et al . , 2018 ) , this does not rule out the effect of co-expression of SESN1 . More powered tissue-specific expression data and experimental work on SESN1 vs . FOXO3 could elucidate the causal mechanism . For now , results from model organisms seem to leave the preponderance of evidence for FOXO3 . Our results suggest disease-associated lifespan variants reduce the chances of extreme long-livedness , but remain agnostic as to the more interesting two-part question: are there longevity variants that have little effect on lifespan in the normal range ( Sebastiani et al . , 2016 ) , and if so , do they control underlying ageing processes ? We note , the genetic overlap between lifespan and extreme long-livedness is high ( 0 . 73 ) , but not complete ( McDaid et al . , 2017 ) . Regardless of this , only a small part of the heritability of both lifespan and longevity has thus far been explained by GWAS . It thus remains plausible that an enlarged long-livedness or lifespan study will find variants controlling the rate of ageing and associated pathways . Curiously , we find little evidence of SNPs of large deleterious effect on lifespan acting with antagonistic pleiotropy on other fitness and developmental component traits , despite long-standing theoretical suggestions to the contrary ( Williams , 1957 ) . However , we did not examine mortality before the age of 40 , or mortality of individuals without offspring ( by definition as we were examining parental lifespans ) , which may exhibit this phenomenon . For the time being , our findings that the improved polygenic risk score for lifespan was associated with an increased prevalence of Alzheimer's disease , Parkinson's disease , and prostate and breast cancer , means we appear to be predominantly measuring a propensity for longer life through avoidance of early disease-induced mortality , rather than healthy ageing or fertility costs . Whilst it has previously been shown that transcriptomic age calculated based on age-related genes is meaningful in the sense that its deviation from the chronological age is associated with biological features linked to ageing ( Peters et al . , 2015 ) , the role of these genes in ageing was unclear . A gene might change expression with age because ( i ) it is a biological clock ( higher expression tracking biological ageing , but not influencing ageing or disease ) ; ( ii ) it is a response to the consequences of ageing ( e . g . a protective response to CVD ) ; ( iii ) it is an indicator of selection bias: if low expression is life-shortening , older people with low expression tend to be eliminated from the study , hence the average expression level of older age groups is higher . However , our results now show that the differential expression of many of the age-related genes discovered by Peters et al . , 2015 are not only biomarkers of ageing , but are also enriched for direct effects on lifespan . There is increasing interest in polygenic risk scores , and their potential clinical utility for some diseases appears to be similar to some Mendelian mutations ( albeit such monogenic tests are usually only applied in the context of family history; Khera et al . , 2018 ) . At first sight , the magnitude of the distinctions in our genetic lifespan score ( 5 years of life between top and bottom deciles , for both the parent and subject generations ) are quite small compared with variability in individual lifespans . However , these distinctions are potentially material at a group level , for example , actuarially . The implied distinction in price ( 14%; Methods ) is greater than some recently reported annuity profit margins ( 8 . 9% ) ( Legal General Group PLC , 2017 ) . In our view , the legal and ethical frameworks ( at least in the UK [Association of British Insurers and UK Government , 2014] ) are presently under-developed for genome-wide scores , whether for disease or lifespan and this needs to be urgently addressed . At the same time , although material in isolation , our lifespan associations may only have practical utility in many applications if they provide additional information than that provided by conventional clinical risk measures ( e . g . the Framingham score [D'Agostino et al . , 2008] ) . Such an assessment has been beyond the scope of this work , in part as such risk measures are not readily available for the parents ( rather than subjects ) studied . One limitation of our study was the power reduction caused by the exclusion of relatives in our study , rather than linear mixed modelling ( LMM ) with a term for kinship as measured by the genomic relationship matrix ( GRM ) ( Pilling et al . , 2017; Loh et al . , 2015 ) . However , as the correct adjustment is not derivable under the kin-cohort method , we felt this was the best approach . To see that the normal adjustment is not correct , consider two siblings . The phenotypes under study are of course identical ( as the parents are the same ) , but the expected correlation under the mixed model would only be 50% of the heritability . Simply excluding siblings , however , is not sufficient . For example , consider two offspring subjects who are first cousins descended from two full brothers . The GRM entry in this situation is 12 . 5% whilst the appropriate relatedness factor for the father trait is 50% and the mother 0% . Exclusion of relatives thus appears the most straightforward solution , although if a pedigree were available , not just a GRM , accurate LMM might have been feasible . The analysis of parent lifespans has enabled us to probe mortality for a generation whose lives are mostly complete and attain increased power in a survival GWAS . However , changes in the environment ( and thus the relative importance of each genetic susceptibility , for example following the smoking ban ) inevitably mean we have less certainty about associations with prospective lifespans for the present generation of middle-aged people , or a different population ( with perhaps different relative importance of disease or even overall heritability of lifespan ) . The 21% reduction in the effect size of the association between our PRS for the UK offspring generation supports this idea , although the estimated contrast in hazard ratios across the deciles was not reduced , which may be a statistical artefact or due to the different periods of life probed . The lower explanatory power of the PRS in Estonia may reflect the differing alleles and LD patterns between the UK training data and the Estonian test data , but also the different environments , in particular the sources of mortality in that country in the Soviet , and early post-Soviet era . In conclusion , recent genomic susceptibility to death in the normal age range seems rooted in modern diseases: Alzheimer’s , CVD and lung cancer; in turn arising from our modern – long-lived , obesogenic and tobacco-laden – environment , however the keys to the distinct traits of ageing and extreme longevity remain elusive . At the same time , genomic information alone can now make material distinctions at a group level in variations in expected length of life , although the limited individual accuracy of these distinctions is far from reaching genetic determinism of that most ( self- ) interesting of traits – your lifespan . 4 Materials and methods Individual phenotypic and genetic data is available from UK Biobank upon application: https://www . ukbiobank . ac . uk/register-apply/ .

{"doi": "elife-27369-v2", "abstract": "Bacteria frequently need to adapt to altered environmental conditions . Adaptation requires changes in gene expression , often mediated by global regulators of transcription . The nucleoid-associated protein H-NS is a key global regulator in Gram-negative bacteria and is believed to be a crucial player in bacterial chromatin organization via its DNA-bridging activity . H-NS activity in vivo is modulated by physico-chemical factors ( osmolarity , pH , temperature ) and interaction partners . Mechanistically , it is unclear how functional modulation of H-NS by such factors is achieved . Here , we show that a diverse spectrum of H-NS modulators alter the DNA-bridging activity of H-NS . Changes in monovalent and divalent ion concentrations drive an abrupt switch between a bridging and non-bridging DNA-binding mode . Similarly , synergistic and antagonistic co-regulators modulate the DNA-bridging efficiency . Structural studies suggest a conserved mechanism: H-NS switches between a ‘closed’ and an ‘open’ , bridging competent , conformation driven by environmental cues and interaction partners .", "plain language summary": "The genetic information every cell needs to work properly is encoded in molecules of DNA that are much longer than the cell itself . A key challenge in biology is to understand how DNA is organized to fit inside each cell , whilst still providing access to the information that it contains . Since the way DNA is organized can influence which genes are active , rearranging DNA plays an important role in controlling how cells behave . In Escherichia coli and many other bacteria , a protein called H-NS contributes to DNA reorganization by forming or rupturing loops in the DNA in response to changes in temperature , the levels of salt and other aspects of the cell’s surroundings . In controlling loop formation , it dictates whether specific genes are switched on or off . However , it remains unclear how H-NS detects the environmental changes . To address this question , van der Valk et al . used biochemical techniques to study the activity of H-NS from E . coli under different environmental conditions . The experiments show that changes in the environment cause structural changes to H-NS , altering its ability to form DNA loops . A previously unnoticed region of the protein acts as a switch to control these structural changes , and ultimately affects which genes are active in the cell . These findings shed new light on how bacteria organize their DNA and the strategies they have developed to adapt to different environments . The new protein region identified in H-NS may also be present in similar proteins found in other organisms . In the future , this knowledge may ultimately help to develop new antibiotic drugs that target H-NS proteins in bacteria .", "article": "1 Introduction Although the bacterial genome is compacted by a vast variety of factors , including DNA supercoiling , and macromolecular crowding , it owes much of its organization to nucleoid-associated proteins ( Dame , 2005; Dame et al . , 2011; Dillon and Dorman , 2010; Dorman , 2013; Rimsky and Travers , 2011; Travers and Muskhelishvili , 2005; Luijsterburg et al . , 2008; Dame and Tark-Dame , 2016 ) . A key protein in nucleoid organization of Gram-negative bacteria is the Histone-like Nucleoid Structuring protein ( H-NS ) . Genome-wide binding studies have revealed that H-NS binds along the genome in long patches ( Grainger et al . , 2006; Kahramanoglou et al . , 2011; Lucchini et al . , 2006; Navarre , 2006; Oshima et al . , 2006 ) , which have been proposed to mediate the formation of genomic loops ( Noom et al . , 2007; van der Valk et al . , 2014 ) . H-NS is also an important regulator of global gene expression , implied in mediating global transcriptional responses to environmental stimuli ( osmolarity , pH , temperature ) ( Atlung and Ingmer , 1997 ) , and operating as xenogeneic silencer , silencing horizontally integrated DNA ( Navarre et al . , 2006 ) . A large fraction of Escherichia coli and Salmonella genes ( 5–10% ) is thus regulated ( usually repressed ) by the action of H-NS . H-NS operation is modulated by environmental stimuli and through interplay with other proteins ( Atlung and Ingmer , 1997; Stoebel et al . , 2008 ) . In solution , the H-NS protein exists as a dimer , which oligomerizes at high concentrations ( Ceschini et al . , 2000; Spurio et al . , 1997 ) . H-NS consists of three structural domains: a C-terminal domain responsible for DNA binding ( Shindo et al . , 1995 ) , a N-terminal dimerization domain ( Bloch et al . , 2003; Cerdan et al . , 2003; Esposito et al . , 2002; Ueguchi et al . , 1996 ) and a central dimer-dimer interaction domain responsible for multimer formation ( Arold et al . , 2010; Leonard et al . , 2009 ) . These two interaction domains are connected by a long α-helix ( Arold et al . , 2010 ) ( helix α3 ) . H-NS exhibits two seemingly distinct DNA-binding modes: DNA bridging ( Dame et al . , 2006; Dame et al . , 2000; Dame et al . , 2001; Dame et al . , 2002; Schneider et al . , 2001 ) , the condensation of DNA by intra- and inter- molecular DNA binding by H-NS and DNA stiffening , the rigidification of DNA through the formation of a H-NS-DNA filament ( Amit et al . , 2003; Dame and Wuite , 2003; Liu et al . , 2010 ) . These modes have been attributed to the basic functional H-NS unit ( a dimer ) binding to DNA either in cis or in trans ( Wiggins et al . , 2009; Joyeux and Vreede , 2013 ) . H-NS paralogues StpA , Sfh , Hfp , and truncated derivatives such as H-NST , have been proposed to modulate H-NS function by forming heteromers with H-NS ( Baños et al . , 2008; Deighan et al . , 2003; Müller et al . , 2010; Williams et al . , 1996; Williamson and Free , 2005 ) , with DNA-binding properties different from homomeric H-NS . Members of the Hha/YmoA family of proteins are H-NS co-regulators with limited sequence homology to H-NS ( Madrid et al . , 2007 ) . At many targets along the genome , H-NS and Hha co-localize . Localization of Hha at these sites is strictly H-NS dependent , whereas the genome-wide binding pattern of H-NS is only mildly affected by Hha ( Ueda et al . , 2013 ) . Although evidence has been put forward that the concentration of divalent ions determines the binding mode of H-NS ( Liu et al . , 2010 ) , a mechanistic explanation is lacking . Moreover , the possible effect of co-regulators of H-NS , such as Hha , on these binding modes has remained unexplored . To obtain a better understanding of the molecular basis underlying the H-NS binding modes , it is crucial to determine the effects of ion valence and concentration , as well as the presence of helper proteins on both the stiffening and the bridging mode . Here , we investigate DNA stiffening on short DNA tethers using Tethered Particle Motion ( TPM ) . As intramolecular DNA bridging does not occur on short DNA tethers , DNA stiffening can be uncoupled from DNA bridging . In addition , to accurately determine intermolecular DNA-bridging efficiencies in solution , we developed a sensitive quantitative bulk assay . Using these two assays , we unravel the assembly pathway of bridged DNA-H-NS-DNA complexes and the roles of mono- and divalent ions , helper proteins Hha and YdgT , and truncated H-NS derivatives . Finally , Molecular Dynamics ( MD ) simulations reveal that ions and interacting proteins directly alter H-NS structure from a ‘closed’ bridging incapable to an ‘open’ bridging capable conformation , thus providing a molecular understanding of the modulation of H-NS function . 2 Results In order to dissect the role of divalent ions in the formation of bridged and stiffened complexes , we applied a novel , sensitive , and quantitative DNA-bridging assay and carried out TPM experiments ( providing a quantitative and selective readout of DNA stiffening ) . The DNA-bridging assay relies on immobilization of bait DNA on magnetic microparticles and the capture and detection of 32P labeled prey DNA if DNA-DNA bridge formation occurs ( see Figure 1—figure supplement 4b for a schematic depiction of the assay ) . 80% of initial prey DNA is recovered at high H-NS concentrations ( see Figure 1a ) . In the absence of either the H-NS protein or bait DNA , no prey DNA is recovered under our experimental conditions . Next , we used this assay to quantify the DNA-bridging efficiency of H-NS as a function of the amount of Mg2+ ions ( see Figure 1b ) , reproducing the qualitative results of Liu et al . ( 2010 ) and providing independent confirmation of the previously observed effects . The concentration range from 0 to 10 mM Mg2+ is considered to be physiologically relevant ( Hurwitz and Rosano , 1967 ) . Importantly , the transition from no bridging to complete bridging is abrupt between 4–6 mM Mg2+ , indicating that changes in Mg2+ concentration might drive a binary switch . Earlier studies have shown that H-NS binding along a single DNA molecule results in DNA stiffening ( Amit et al . , 2003; Liu et al . , 2010 ) . However , due to the co-occurrence of DNA bridging , previous studies were incapable of measuring DNA stiffening in the presence of Mg2+ . Here , we used TPM to investigate DNA stiffening as a function of Mg2+ concentration . In TPM , the Root Mean Square displacement ( RMS ) of bead movement is a direct reflection of tether stiffness and length ( Figure 1—figure supplement 4a ) . DNA-binding proteins can affect both , but previous studies have shown that the DNA contour length is not affected by binding of H-NS ( Dame et al . , 2006; Dame et al . , 2001 ) . Thus , an increase in stiffness due to H-NS binding translates into a higher RMS value of a DNA tether ( Figure 1d ) . Here , we measured the effects of H-NS on DNA stiffness in the absence and presence of 10 mM Mg2+ and confirmed that H-NS stiffens DNA ( Amit et al . , 2003; Liu et al . , 2010 ) ; importantly , our experiments reveal that Mg2+ does not affect the stiffness of the fully formed H-NS-DNA complexes at saturation , as in both conditions the RMS is the same ( Figure 1d ) . Analysis of the binding characteristics using the McGhee-von Hippel equation revealed that the association constant of H-NS is somewhat reduced in the presence of Mg2+ , while cooperativity increases under these conditions ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1a , d ) . The reduction in DNA-binding affinity of H-NS may be attributed to shielding of the negatively charged phosphate backbone by Mg2+ . The cooperative binding of H-NS and DNA stiffening observed by TPM suggest that H-NS multimerizes along DNA , likely via the recently defined dimer-dimer interaction domain ( Arold et al . , 2010 ) . Multimerization along DNA has been previously suggested ( Esposito et al . , 2002; Williams et al . , 1996 ) but has never been conclusively demonstrated . To test this hypothesis , we generated a mutant , H-NSY61DM64D , predicted to have disrupted dimer-dimer interaction based on the H-NS1-83 crystal structure ( Arold et al . , 2010 ) . Size exclusion chromatography showed that this H-NS mutant indeed exists solely as a dimer in solution independent of protein concentration ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1b ) , whereas wild-type H-NS forms large multimeric structures ( Figure 1—figure supplements 1a and Arold et al . , 2010; Leonard et al . , 2009 ) . The multimerization behavior of both proteins was unaffected by the presence of Mg2+ . Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay confirmed that the DNA binding of the H-NS mutant is intact ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ) . TPM experiments reveal that H-NSY61DM64D binding does not lead to the formation of stiff H-NS-DNA filaments ( Figure 1e ) . The RMS is reduced compared to that of bare DNA , indicating not only that dimer-dimer interactions are disrupted , but also that individual H-NS dimers mildly distort DNA . DNA-bridging experiments reveal that H-NSY61DM64D is also incapable of forming DNA-H-NS-DNA complexes ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3 ) . This indicates that individual H-NSY61DM64D dimers do not form stable bridges and that dimer-mediated bridging , involving H-NS-dimer binding cooperativity due to high local DNA concentration adjacent to existing bridges ( Dame et al . , 2006; Dame et al . , 2000 ) , is insufficient to explain the formation of bridged DNA-H-NS-DNA complexes . The nature of the effect of Mg2+ on DNA-bridging efficiency is not understood . An increase in affinity would be expected if Mg2+ would only facilitate interactions between the DNA phosphate backbone and negatively charged residues on H-NS , but this is not observed ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) . As Mg2+ does not affect the multimeric state of H-NS in solution ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) , a model involving an effect on H-NS multimerization can be excluded . A structural effect of Mg2+ on individual units within H-NS filaments could explain the observed effects of Mg2+ on the bridging efficiency of H-NS . To investigate the role of Mg2+ on individual H-NS dimers we carried out MD simulations of an H-NS dimer in both the absence and presence of Mg2+ , using our previously established model of a full-length H-NS dimer ( van der Valk et al . , 2014 ) . Visual inspection of the H-NS dimer simulations at 50 mM KCl reveals that H-NS changes from an ‘open’ extended conformation into more compact ‘closed’ shapes ( see Figure 2a for snapshots from these simulations , Figure 2—figure supplement 1 for examples of the ‘closed’ conformation , or Figure 2—video 1 for a movie of one such simulation ) . The three domains in H-NS interact , and these inter-domain interactions are facilitated by partial unfolding and buckling of the long central α helix ( helix α3 ) connecting the dimerization and dimer-dimer interaction domains . The average distance between the donor and acceptor of all helical hydrogen bonds ( O-H distance ) in helix α3 indicates that the buckle forms in region Glu42-Ala49 ( Figure 2b ) . By analyzing the O-H distance between residues Ser45 and Ala49 in time , key residues at the site of buckle formation ( see Figure 2—figure supplement 3 ) , we found that buckles can be reversible and irreversible , within the simulation time scale of 50 ns . Reversible buckles , caused by thermal fluctuations , typically last a few nanoseconds and occur several times during a single simulation run ( see green line in Figure 2—figure supplement 3 for an example ) . Irreversible buckles , stabilized by inter-domain interactions , do not return to a helical conformation during our simulations ( see red line in Figure 2—figure supplement 3 for an example ) . To characterize the interactions that occur during the simulations , we generated contact maps that show the probability of finding interactions between residues , with a contact defined as the minimum distance between two residues being 0 . 6 nm or less , see Materials and methods for details of this analysis ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2a ) . These maps reveal that the DNA-binding domain interacts with other parts of the protein complex . In absence of Mg2+ , the DNA-binding domain interacts with the dimerization domain , rendering the DNA-binding QGR motif ( residues 112–114 ) ( Gordon et al . , 2011 ) of one DNA-binding domain inaccessible ( see the snapshots in Figure 2a ) . Although the simulations were performed in absence of DNA , these observations suggest that DNA bridging is not possible in such a conformation , as the H-NS dimer can bind DNA only through its remaining/second DNA-binding domain . In this ‘closed’ conformation , interactions occur between the IRT residues at position 10–12 and the AMDEQGK residues at position 122–128 . These interactions are hydrophilic in nature , supplemented by a salt bridge between R11 and D124 or E125 . In the presence of Mg2+ interactions between the DNA-binding domain and the dimerization domain no longer occur ( see the snapshots in Figure 2a or the movie in Figure 2—video 2 ) , The absence of such interactions is further illustrated by the contact map in Figure 2—figure supplement 2b and in higher detail in Figure 2—figure supplement 5 . The likelihood of finding Mg2+ interacting with ( i . e . being within 0 . 6 nm of ) H-NS residues , indicated by PMg2+ , revealed that Mg2+ has a preference for glutamate residues in region 22–35 ( Figure 2c , Figure 2—figure supplement 8 ) , where the ions shield this region from interacting with the DNA-binding domains . The Mg2+ ions transiently interact with the glutamate residues , with residence times in the order of a few ns ( as seen in Figure 2—video 2 ) . Furthermore , Mg2+ ions interact with region 98–105 ( sequence DENGE ) , right next to the DNA-binding QGR motif ( Figure 2c ) . The presence of Mg2+ stabilizes the ‘open’ conformation of H-NS , ensuring that DNA bridging can occur . Furthermore , we noted that Mg2+ is also located close to the buckle and may directly stabilize helix α3 through interactions with Glu42 , Glu43 , Glu44 , and Ser45 ( Figure 2—figure supplement 7 ) , resulting in an ‘open’ , bridging capable , H-NS conformation ( see Figure 2—videos 1 and 2 ) . These data suggest that Mg2+ modulates H-NS by shielding interactions between the DNA-binding domain and dimerization domain , and by influencing the conformation of helix α3 . Based on these observations , we designed an H-NS mutant predicted to bridge DNA independent of Mg2+ . We therefore generated a mutant in which several of the amino acids involved in buckle formation ( E43 , E44 , S45 ) were substituted with alanines . In our DNA-bridging assay , H-NSE43A , E44A , S45A retains its ability to bridge DNA , but indeed achieves high DNA recovery ( ±50% ) in the absence of Mg2+ ( Figure 2—figure supplement 9a ) . Low concentrations of Mg2+ are sufficient to reach saturated DNA bridging ( up to 80% DNA recovery ) ( Figure 2—figure supplement 9a ) . This observation independently confirms our model that the stretch of glutamates at the buckle is responsible for Mg2+ sensing and Mg2+-dependent bridging by H-NS . Additionally , we note that the DNA-binding affinity of H-NE43A , E44A , S45A is not significantly altered and that its DNA binding cooperativity is similar to that of wildtype H-NS in the absence of Mg2+ ( Figure 2—figure supplement 9b , Figure 3—figure supplement 1d ) . Yet , in the presence of Mg2+ , wild-type H-NS exhibits a far more cooperative DNA binding ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1d ) . This suggests that the transition between the ‘open’ and ‘closed’ conformation of H-NS promotes lateral filament formation by H-NS . Although it has long been known that the expression of some H-NS controlled genes ( such as the proU operon ) is modulated by the osmolarity of the medium ( Cairney et al . , 1985 ) , the underlying mechanism remains undetermined . Previous studies have revealed that the H-NS DNA stiffening mode is mildly sensitive to the KCl concentration ( Amit et al . , 2003; Liu et al . , 2010 ) . Using TPM , we were able to confirm these observations . The reduction in DNA stiffening is gradual ( Dame and Wuite , 2003 ) and modest ( Figure 1f ) . It is thus questionable whether the multimerization of H-NS along DNA alone is sufficient to explain its role in repression of transcription ( and modulation thereof ) . Could the modulation of gene repression be due to ionic effects on DNA-bridging efficiency ? Using our DNA-bridging assay , we observed complete abolishment of H-NS DNA bridging by KCl at concentrations exceeding 120 mM ( Figure 1c ) , a binary response , similar to what we observed for the Mg2+ titration . This in vitro observation mirrors the in vivo response of the ProU operon , at which KCl concentrations exceeding 100 mM are required to alleviate H-NS-mediated repression ( Cairney et al . , 1985 ) . Control experiments using K-glutamate ( Figure 1—figure supplement 5 ) confirm that K+ , and not the counter-ion , is responsible for the observed effects , even though the counter ion may affect the DNA-binding affinity of the protein ( Figure 1—figure supplements 5c and Leirmo et al . , 1987 ) This strong and abrupt effect on DNA bridging , while leaving DNA stiffening essentially unaffected , might indicate that H-NS reverts to the ‘closed’ conformation by the addition of K+ . To investigate this effect at a structural level we performed MD simulations at high KCl concentrations . The presence of 130 mM KCl alters interactions between the various domains in H-NS ( see contact maps in Figure 2—figure supplement 2c and d ) . In addition to interactions between the DNA-binding domain and the dimerization domain , the two DNA-binding domains in the dimer interact with each other . Moreover , the DNA-binding domains interact with helix α3 . In particular regions 98–105 ( KYSYVDENGE ) and 123–129 ( EQGKS ) are involved in these interactions . The average distance between the donors and acceptors in the hydrogen bonds within helix α3 ( Figure 2b ) indicates that that buckles in helix α3 also occur at a high KCl concentration , at the same location as determined by low-salt conditions . These observations indicate that the ‘closed’ state can have multiple forms ( see Figure 2—figure supplement 1 for snapshots ) , but that all these conformations block the DNA-binding motif QGR from interacting with DNA . The presence of Mg2+ does not significantly alter the occurrence of buckles ( Figure 2b ) . Instead , Mg2+ is capable of deterring interactions between the DNA-binding domain and the dimerization domain by shielding residues in the dimerization domain involved in these interactions ( Figure 2c , Figure 2—figure supplement 8 ) . However , the probability of interactions occurring between the DNA-binding domain and other parts of the protein is reduced significantly in the presence of Mg2+ ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2 and Figure 2—figure supplement 5 ) . High K+ concentrations therefore inhibit H-NS bridging by promoting the ‘closed’ conformation of H-NS even in the presence of Mg2+ and elucidates the modulatory and regulatory effects of KCl and osmolarity . In addition to environmental factors such as osmolarity , H-NS activity is affected by interactions with other proteins in vivo . Members of the Hha/YmoA protein family , such as Hha and YdgT , are known to cooperate with H-NS in repression of genes ( Baños et al . , 2008 ) , while other proteins such as H-NST are capable of inhibiting H-NS function ( Liu et al . , 2010 ) , likely by hampering H-NS multimerization . To systematically investigate the latter mechanism , we designed and synthesized truncated H-NS derivatives , targeting the H-NS dimerization domain ( H-NS1-58 ) or dimer-dimer interaction domain ( H-NS56-83 ) . Interfering with H-NS dimerization , through the addition of H-NS1-58 in DNA-bridging experiments , we observed a reduction in DNA recovery from 75% to 20% at ratios higher than 1: 3 H-NS1-58/ H-NS ( Figure 3a ) . Similarly , targeting the dimer-dimer interaction domain ( through H-NS56-82 ) resulted in complete abolishment of DNA bridging ( Figure 3a ) . Next , we investigated the effects of H-NS derivatives on H-NS DNA stiffening using TPM . Only at very high H-NS derivative concentrations ( 30-fold excess ) reduction of DNA stiffening was observed ( Figure 3b ) . These experiments reveal that both H-NS dimerization and dimer-dimer interactions can be effectively targeted for inhibition of H-NS activity and that the respective domains are crucial to the formation of bridged filaments . This suggests that natural H-NS inhibitors such as H-NST operate by disrupting DNA bridging and provides clues for rational design of artificial peptide inhibitors of H-NS . Gene regulation by H-NS often occurs in conjunction with other proteins; these co-regulators are known to interact with H-NS at specific loci along the genome . Two such proteins , Hha , and YdgT , are members of the Hha/YmoA ( Madrid et al . , 2007 ) family of proteins . In order to understand the modulation of H-NS function by these proteins we investigated their influence on the H-NS DNA binding modes . We observed that Hha , when added at equimolar concentrations , enhances DNA bridging by H-NS at low Mg2+ concentrations ( Figure 3c ) . A similar enhancement of H-NS-mediated DNA bridging was observed with the Hha paralogue , YdgT . While Hha and YdgT promote DNA bridging to a similar extent , YdgT promotes DNA bridging at significantly lower concentrations , likely due to a higher affinity for H-NS . At higher concentrations of YdgT the effect on H-NS-mediated bridging closely resembles the bridging profile obtained for H-NSE43A , E44A , S45A ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2 ) . To determine whether enhanced DNA bridging is due to structural changes in H-NS-DNA filaments , we investigated the effects of Hha and YdgT on DNA stiffening ( Figure 3d ) . TPM experiments show a mild increase in H-NS mediated DNA stiffening in the presence of Hha . We observe a negative offset in RMS in the presence of YdgT , indicating a more compact conformation . Specifically , this is evident in TPM experiments containing H-NS , YdgT , and Mg2+ , where in the presence of Mg2+ and YdgT , H-NS causes ‘DNA collapse’ in TPM ( data not shown ) , similar to earlier observations for H-NS in the presence of Mg2+ without ( Liu et al . , 2010; Wang et al . , 2014 ) or with Hha added ( Wang et al . , 2014 ) . This ‘DNA collapse’ is attributed to H-NS-mediated DNA bridge formation . One possible explanation for the effects of Hha and YdgT , is that they effectively increase the DNA-binding affinity of H-NS ( Ali et al . , 2013 ) . To investigate whether Hha affects H-NS conformation , we performed MD simulations , incorporating structural information from the recently resolved H-NS1-43-Hha co-crystal structure ( Ali et al . , 2013 ) . Our MD simulations reveal that Hha does not prevent buckles in helix α3 ( see Figure 2b ) . Instead Hha alters the interactions between the dimerization domain and the DNA-binding domain ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2 ) by blocking access to parts of dimerization domain . This hypothesis is further supported by interactions between Hha and other parts of H-NS , including the DNA-binding domain and helix α3 ( Figure 2—figure supplement 6 ) . In the presence of Mg2+ and Hha , the contacts between the DNA-binding domain and dimerization domain are reduced even further . This shows that Hha modulates H-NS function by stabilizing the ‘open’ -bridging capable- conformation of H-NS . 3 Discussion It has been known for many years that H-NS binding induces gene silencing . H-NS activity in vivo is modulated by physico-chemical factors ( osmolarity , pH , temperature ) and interaction partners . These findings support the hypothesis that H-NS plays a role in environmental adaptation . However , mechanistically it is unclear how functional modulation of H-NS by such factors is achieved . Based on our findings , we conclude that H-NS is incapable of bridging or stiffening DNA as dimers . H-NS dimers bind DNA in cis ( Dame et al . , 2006; Dame et al . , 2000 ) and associate side-by-side along DNA , likely via the recently identified dimer-dimer interaction domain ( Arold et al . , 2010 ) , resulting in DNA stiffening . This process is cooperative as H-NS dimers interact with neighbors , as well as with DNA . Our studies reveal that H-NS-DNA filaments are structurally very similar , independent of the presence of Mg2+ ( Figure 1d ) . But functionally , these H-NS-DNA filaments are distinct . H-NS can be ‘activated’ by Mg2+ , which promotes a conformational change , rendering both DNA-binding domains of H-NS dimers accessible for DNA bridging . In our model , the assembly of bridged complexes proceeds in distinct steps: ( 1 ) nucleation ( Lang et al . , 2007 ) ( binding of an H-NS dimer at a high affinity site ) , ( 2 ) lateral filament growth by H-NS dimer-dimer interactions ( leading to DNA stiffening ) and ( 3 ) bridging of the assembled filament to bare DNA provided in trans ( Figure 4 ) . Each step can potentially be modulated by osmolarity and protein interaction partners . Here , we show that these factors most effectively target DNA bridging . What are the implications of our observations ? Our observations add to the large body of evidence showing that regulation of transcription via H-NS is complex , and that it does not proceed via a single , simple , well-defined mechanism . The most straightforward form of repression by H-NS is via occlusion of RNA polymerase from the promoter ( Lim et al . , 2012; Prosseda et al . , 2004; Göransson et al . , 1990 ) . Whether this mechanism of repression involves lateral filament formation or bridging is unclear . It is expected that both types of complexes assembled at a promoter site can in principle occlude RNA polymerase . A second mechanism of repression is to trap RNA polymerase at the promoter , preventing promoter escape ( Schröder and Wagner , 2000; Shin et al . , 2005 ) . RNA polymerase trapping likely involves DNA bridging of promoter upstream and downstream elements ( Dame et al . , 2002; Shin et al . , 2005 ) . A third mechanism of repression by H-NS is to interfere with RNA polymerase progression during active transcription by intragenic binding ( Dole et al . , 2004 ) . In this model , both modes could interfere with transcription . However , it was suggested recently that only bridged filaments are capable of interfering with transcription ( Kotlajich et al . , 2015 ) , with lateral filaments likely being disassembled as RNA polymerase encounters them . Generally , the type of complex formed by H-NS is expected to depend on the type and number of ions , combined with local DNA conformation ( dependent on DNA sequence or DNA topology ) , and the presence of modulating proteins . The interplay between these factors will determine the strength of the complex , and degree of repression . Thus , different H-NS repressed genes are expected to be subject to different types of modulation , providing a key to a coordinated response in gene expression to altered conditions and selectivity for the interplay with specific co-regulators at specific target regions . 4 Materials and methods H-NS/H-NSY61DM64D/H-NSE43A , E44A , S45A . BL21 ( DE3 ) ( RRID: WB-STRAIN: HT115 ( DE3 ) ) Δhns::kan/frt pLysE ( NT201 , our lab ) cells transformed with plasmids expressing H-NS/H-NS mutants were grown to an OD600 of 0 . 4 , and induced for 2 hr using IPTG ( 500 μM ) . For the H-NE43A , E44A , S45A protein , the cells were co-transformed with pRD252 , coding for LacI to help suppress leaky expression of H-NE43A , E44A , S45A . The cells were pelleted and lysed by sonication in 100 mM NH4Cl , 20 mM Tris pH 7 . 2 , 10% glycerol , 8 mM β-mercaptoethanol , 3 mM benzamidine ) . The soluble fraction was loaded onto a P11 column and eluted using a 100 mM-1 M NH4Cl gradient , the protein eluted at 280 mM NH4Cl . The peak fractions were dialysed to buffer B ( identical to buffer A , but containing 130 mM NaCl instead of NH4Cl ) by overnight dialysis . The dialysate was loaded onto a heparin column ( GE Healthcare ) and eluted using a 130 mM-1 M NaCl gradient , the protein eluted at 350 mM NaCl . The pooled peak fractions were dialysed to buffer B and concentrated using a 1 ml Resource-Q column ( GE Healthcare ) . The purity of the protein was verified on an SDS-PAGE gel . The protein concentration was determined using a Bicinchoninic Acid assay ( Pierce BCA protein assay kit , Thermo Scientific ) . Size exclusion chromatography was done using a Superose-12 column with a flow of 0 . 3 ml/min , pre-equilibrated with 10 mM Tris-HCl , 50 mM KCl , 5% glycerol containing or lacking 10 mM MgCl2 . The absorbance of the eluting fractions was measured at 215 nm . These experiments were performed in triplicate . Streptavidin-coated paramagnetic Dynabeads M280 ( Invitrogen ) were washed once with 100 μL of 1xPBS and twice with Coupling Buffer ( CB: 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8 . 0 , 2 mM EDTA , 2 M NaCl , 2 mg/mL BSA ( ac ) , 0 . 04% Tween20 ) according to manufacturer instructions . After washing , the beads were resuspended in 200 µL CB containing 100 nM biotinylated DNA . Next , the bead suspensions were incubated for 30 min on a rotary shaker ( 1000 rpm ) at 25°C . After incubation , the beads were washed twice with Incubation buffer ( IB: 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8 . 0 , 50 mM KCl , 10* mM MgCl2 , 5% v/v Glycerol , 1 mM DTT and 1 mM Spermidine ) before resuspension in IB and addition of ±8000 cpm of radioactively labeled 32P 685 bp DNA . Radioactive DNA was supplemented with unlabeled 685 bp DNA to maintain a constant ( 20 nM ) DNA concentration . The DNA-bridging protein H-NS ( concentrations indicated in the text ) , and if applicable Hha or YdgT were added and the mixture was incubated for 30 min on a shaker ( 1000 rpm ) at 25°C . To remove unbridged prey DNA , the beads were washed with IB , before resuspension in 12 μL stop buffer ( 10 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 1 mM EDTA , 200 mM NaCl , 0 . 2% SDS ) . All samples were quantified through liquid scintillation counting over 10 min . All values recovered from the DNA-bridging assay were corrected for background signal ( using a sample lacking H-NS ) , and normalized to a reference sample containing the amount of labeled 32P 685 bp DNA used in the assay . The samples were then run on a 5% 0 . 5x TBE gel to ensure DNA integrity . DNA bridging was calculated based on a reference sample containing 2 µL of prey DNA . All DNA-bridging experiments were performed in triplicate . Unless indicated otherwise all DNA-bridging experiments were performed in the presence of 10 mM of MgCl2 and 3 , 3 µM of H-NS ( 10% more H-NS than is required for saturation - see Figure 1A ) . Each experiment contains 50 mM KCl , to which additional KCl or K-glutamate are added depending on the experimental condition tested . Tethered particle motion experiments were performed as reported previously ( Driessen et al . , 2014; van der Valk et al . , 2017 ) . Flow cells were prepared as described with minor modifications ( Driessen et al . , 2014; van der Valk et al . , 2017 ) . Here , before flowing in protein diluted in the experimental buffer ( 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8 . 0 , 50 mM KCl , 10 mM MgCl2/EDTA , 5% v/v Glycerol , 1 mM DTT ) the flow cell was washed using 4 flow cell volumes with the experimental buffer . Next , the flow cell was incubated for 10 min with protein solution before sealing the flow cell . The flow cell was maintained at a constant temperature of 25°C . Measurements were started 10 min after the introduction of protein solution . TPM experiments were done at least in duplicate . The data were analyzed as previously described ( Driessen et al . , 2014; van der Valk et al . , 2017 ) . The RMS was first converted to persistence length ( Lp ) using Equation 1 ( Göransson et al . , 1990 ) : ( 1 ) RMS=233- 156 ( 1+0 . 08Lp ) 0 . 45 Lp values were then used to calculate the fractional coverage ( Equation 2 ) ( Göransson et al . , 1990 ) : ( 2 ) nϑ=1Lp , measured-1Lp , naked1Lp , saturated-1Lp , naked The fractional coverage ( d ) was fit using the McGhee-von Hippel model for cooperative lattice binding ( Equation 3-5 ) ( McGhee and von Hippel , 1974 ) : ( 3 ) ϑc=K∙1-d∙2ω+11-d+ϑ-R2ω-11-dn-1∙1-n+1ϑ+R2 ( 1-d ) 2 where ( 4 ) R= ( 1-n+1ϑ ) 2+4ωϑ ( 1-d ) andd=nϑ Here , the association constant ( K ) is described as a function of the protein concentration ( c ) and a cooperativity parameter ( ω ) . To this end , weighted orthogonal distance regression ( ODR ) was performed to estimate the parameters of the nonlinear implicit equation describing the cooperative ligand binding . The binding site size ( n ) of H-NS was fixed to a value of 30 bp during regression , which corresponds to values determined previously ( Dame et al . , 2006; Amit et al . , 2003 ) . The association constant ( K ) and the cooperativity parameter ( ω ) were assumed to be positive real numbers . A custom fitting routine was implemented in Fortran and makes use of the ODRPACK library ( Boggs et al . , 1992 ) . The starting conformation of the full-length H-NS dimer was constructed as described previously ( van der Valk et al . , 2014 ) . The system was placed in a periodic dodecahedron box with a distance of at least 0 . 8 nm between the box edge and the most extended atom of the protein dimer , followed by the addition of water and ions . With this system we performed Molecular Dynamics ( MD ) simulations of full length H-NS at different concentrations of KCl , and MgCl2 and with the addition of Hha , summing up to a total of six different systems . Hha was added by aligning the crystal structure containing the H-NS – Hha complex ( PDB code 4ICG [Ali et al . , 2013] ) with the full-length structural model and copying the Hha molecules . System size ranged from 513457 atoms for the Hha systems to around 1 , 135 , 000 atoms for the other four systems . Interactions between atoms were described by the AMBER99-SB-ILDN force field ( Lindorff-Larsen et al . , 2010 ) , in combination with the TIP3P water model ( Jorgensen et al . , 1983 ) . Long-range electrostatic interactions were treated via the Particle Mesh Ewald method ( Darden et al . , 1993; Essmann et al . , 1995 ) with a short-range electrostatic cutoff distance at 1 . 1 nm . Van der Waals interactions were cut off at 1 . 1 nm . Preparation of the systems consisted of energy minimization equilibration of the solvent . Energy minimization was performed by the conjugate gradient method . After energy minimization , the positions of water molecules and ions were equilibrated by a 1 ns molecular dynamics run at a temperature of 298 K and a pressure of 1 bar in which the heavy atoms in the protein were position-restrained with a force constant in each direction of 1000 kJ/mol nm . After preparation , we performed 16 50 ns runs for each system , varying initial conditions by assigning new random starting velocities drawn from the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution at 298 K . All simulations were performed with GROMACS v . 4 . 6 . 3 ( Pronk et al . , 2013 ) at the Dutch National Supercomputer with the leap-frog integration scheme and a time step of 2 fs , using LINCS ( Hess et al . , 1997 ) to constrain all bonds . All simulations were performed in the isothermal-isobaric ensemble at a pressure of 1 bar , using the v-rescale thermostat ( Bussi et al . , 2007 ) and the Parrinello-Rahman barostat ( Parrinello and Rahman , 1981 ) . Frames were stored every 10 ps . The first 10 ns of each simulation are excluded from analysis , unless stated otherwise . Analysis focused on determining contacts between domains , between H-NS and Hha , between H-NS and ions , and helical hydrogen bonds . Contact maps of interactions between residues in the H-NS dimer system were obtained by first calculating the minimum distance between each residue pair in the system . A residue pair is counted to be in contact if they are at a minimum distance of 0 . 6 nm or less . The probability of a contact is then calculated as the average over all 16 simulations ( excluding the first 10 ns ) and displayed as a contact probability matrix . We used a modified version of the g_mdmat tool in GROMACS ( Pronk et al . , 2013 ) in combination with Perl scripts to generate contact maps . To determine the location of ions with respect to the H-NS system , we calculated the minimum distance between each residue in the H-NS dimer and the ions and counted a contact if the distance between an H-NS residue and an ion is 0 . 6 nm or less . These contact probabilities ( PMg2+ , PK+ and PCl- ) are averaged over all 16 simulations and the two monomers . A similar procedure was performed to determine the probability of contacts between H-NS and Hha , PHha , and between H-NS domains , with P1-40 indicating the probability of finding the DNA-binding domain ( residues 96–137 ) close to the dimerization domain ( residues 1–40 ) . P96-137 indicates the probability of finding the dimerization domain close to the DNA-binding domain . To determine the location of the buckle in helix α3 , we calculated the helical hydrogen bond distances dO-N for residues 22–67 in each monomer between the backbone carbonyl oxygen O of residue i and the backbone amide nitrogen N of residue i + 4 . A hydrogen bond is counted to be in contact if they are at a minimum distance of 0 . 35 nm or less . These probabilities are averaged over all 16 simulations ( excluding the first 10 ns ) and the two monomers . Snapshots and movies were generated with PyMOL ."}

Broadly , all vertebrates have a similar body shape with a head at one end and a left and right side that are similar to each other . Although this is not very obvious in humans , vertebrate bodies are derived from pairs of segments arranged from the head to the tail . Each of these segments or somites originates early in embryonic development . Cells from each somite then divide , grow and specialize to form bones such as the vertebrae of the vertebral column , muscles , skin , and other tissues that make up each segment . Studying different animals during embryonic development has provided insights into how somites form and grow , but it is technically difficult to do and only provides an approximate model of how somites develop in humans . Being able to make and study somites using human cells in the lab would help scientists learn more about how somite formation in humans is regulated . Budjan et al . grew human stem cells in the lab as three-dimensional structures called organoids , and used chemical signals similar to the ones produced in the embryo during development to make the cells form somites . Various combinations of signals were tested to find the best way to trigger somite formation . Once the somites formed , Budjan et al . measured them and studied their structure and the genes they used . They found that these lab-grown somites have the same size and structure as natural somites and use many of the same genes . This new organoid model provides a way to study human somite formation and development in the lab for the first time .

Somites give rise and contribute to a variety of tissues including skeletal muscle , dermis , cartilage , and bone ( Chal and Pourquié , 2017 ) . Somite formation is controlled by a conserved molecular oscillator , the segmentation clock ( Dequéant et al . , 2006; Hubaud and Pourquié , 2014; Oates et al . , 2012 ) . Previous efforts have focused on how this oscillator controls somite formation using a variety of model systems such as mouse , zebrafish , and chick because of ethical and technical limitations of culturing human embryos . Recently , researchers were able to recapitulate PM development using human and mouse pluripotent stem cells cultured as 2D monolayers ( Chu et al . , 2019; Diaz-Cuadros et al . , 2020; Matsuda et al . , 2020 ) . These cells undergo species-characteristic oscillations similar to their in vivo counterparts . However , final stages of somite development and vertebra formation were not observed in currently published human cell culture systems ( Palla and Blau , 2020 ) , suggesting that certain aspects of in vivo development are not recapitulated in these 2D systems . We reasoned that a 3D cell culture system may exhibit all the stages of PM development including morphogenetic processes associated with somite formation . Here , we describe an organoid system derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells ( hiPSCs ) called Somitoids , which faithfully recapitulates functional , morphological , and molecular features of PM development , including formation of somite-like structures in vitro . To identify the culture conditions that reproducibly yielded formation of somite-like structures , we developed a quantitative image-based screening platform for individual organoids . Our screening approach identified the optimal parameter values for the culture conditions such as the initial cell number and the concentration of the chemical modulators . We show using single-cell RNA-sequencing ( scRNA-seq ) , immunofluorescence , and qRT-PCR that Somitoids resemble their in vivo counterparts both transcriptionally and morphologically and can be differentiated into somite derivatives such as sclerotome and dermomyotome in vitro . Our Somitoid system is reproducible and scalable , allowing for systematic and quantitative analysis of PM development and somite formation to study human spine development and disease in a dish . Finally , our approach can be used to systematically screen organoid cultures for desired phenotypes and reproducibility . 2 Results Recently , protocols have been developed to differentiate mouse or human pluripotent stem cells ( hPSCs ) towards PM using a combination of the WNT agonist CHIR and BMP inhibitor LDN ( Chal et al . , 2015; Diaz-Cuadros et al . , 2020 ) . To adapt the protocol for a 3D model of human somitogenesis , we first optimized the initial conditions of our cultures by generating pluripotent spheroids of defined cell numbers . hiPSCs were allowed to aggregate for 24 hr as suspension cultures in pluripotency media ( mTeSR1 ) in the presence of ROCK inhibitor and polyvinyl alcohol ( PVA ) to promote aggregation ( Figure 1A ) . These pluripotent spheroids resemble cavity-stage epiblast embryos as previously described for kidney organoid cultures ( Freedman et al . , 2015; Figure 1B , Figure 1—figure supplement 1A ) . Next , spheroids were cultured in media containing CHIR and LDN ( CL ) , similarly as done for the monolayer cultures ( Chal et al . , 2015; Diaz-Cuadros et al . , 2020 ) , but with CHIR at a higher concentration ( 10 µM ) . After 24 hr in CL media , epiblast-stage cells transition to a neuromesodermal progenitor ( NMp ) or primitive streak cell fate , characterized by co-expression of T/BRA and SOX2 ( Tzouanacou et al . , 2009; Figure 1B ) . By 48 hr , cells rapidly downregulate SOX2 and express PSM markers , including TBX6 and MSGN1 ( Figure 1B ) . This PSM state persists from day 2 to day 4 and is also characterized by the expression of segmentation clock genes such as HES7 ( Figure 1C ) . On day 5 , organoids showed expression of marker genes associated with somite fate as characterized by qPCR ( Figure 1C , Figure 1—figure supplement 1B ) . Taken together , the order of activation of marker genes in the PM organoids followed the expected stages of differentiation observed during PM development . We observed that following the above protocol resulted in a heterogeneous activation of somite marker genes across cells within the same organoid and across different replicates , as well as a low number of somite-like structures ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ) . To improve reproducibility , we set out to screen for the optimal initial cell number , the concentration of the signaling factors , and the timing of their additions during culture . For our primary screen , we compared organoids with an initial cell number of 500 and 1000 as well as combinations of modulators of candidate signaling pathways that have previously been involved in PM development and somite formation , including FGF , WNT , BMP , and TGF-β ( Aulehla et al . , 2008; Chal et al . , 2015; Hubaud and Pourquié , 2014; Tonegawa et al . , 1997; Xi et al . , 2017 ) . We primarily focused on the FGF and WNT signaling pathways since their critical role during somitogenesis is well established both in vivo ( Aulehla et al . , 2008; Aulehla et al . , 2003; Delfini et al . , 2005; Dubrulle et al . , 2001; Dunty et al . , 2008; Greco et al . , 1996; Yamaguchi et al . , 1999 ) and in vitro ( Chal et al . , 2015; Sakurai et al . , 2012; Tan et al . , 2013 ) . Furthermore , dual inhibition of FGF and WNT signaling has been used with some success to generate PM derivatives in vitro ( Loh et al . , 2016; Matsuda et al . , 2020 ) . Finally , the BMP and TGF-β signaling pathways have been shown in vitro and in vivo to have a role in human somitogenesis ( Loh et al . , 2016; Xi et al . , 2017 ) . PSM-stage organoids on day 3 were treated with signaling modulators for 24 and 48 hr , and somite fate and morphogenesis was assessed using PAX3 , a somite fate marker , and F-ACTIN , a structural marker of somite formation ( Figure 2A ) . We chose day 3 as a starting point for our systematic screen because PSM marker gene expression was more uniform compared to day 2 organoids ( Figure 1B ) , and day 4 organoids are not significantly different from day 3 organoids based on a previous study and our own immunostaining and qPCR data ( Figure 1B and C; Diaz-Cuadros et al . , 2020 ) . To quantitatively compare conditions , we developed an image analysis pipeline to determine organoid diameter and normalized average PAX3 expression intensity per organoid in an automated manner ( Figure 2C and D , Figure 2—figure supplement 2B ) . We analyzed three organoids per condition . Strikingly , all organoids that were treated with any combination of FGF or WNT inhibitor reproducibly expressed PAX3 within 24 hr of treatment ( Figure 2B and D ) . However , organoids that were initiated from 1000 cells displayed a higher fraction of PAX3-negative cells compared with organoids initiated from 500 cells , even though the average PAX3 expression levels across the entire organoid were comparable ( Figure 2D , Figure 2—figure supplement 2A ) . Additional staining for SOX2 , a neural marker , showed that PAX3-negative cells expressed SOX2 , suggesting that our PM organoids derive from NMps ( Figure 1B , Figure 2—figure supplement 2A ) . In addition , staining for F-ACTIN , together with nuclear expression of PAX3 , more consistently revealed somite-like structures ( radial arrangement of PAX3+ columnar cells with expression of apical F-ACTIN in the central cavity ) in organoids made from 500 cells compared with organoids made from 1000 cells ( Figure 2B , Figure 2—figure supplement 3A and B ) . Taken together , based on these observations , we used 500 cells as the initial cell number going forward . Organoids that were treated for 48 hr with signaling pathway modulators showed an overall decrease of PAX3 expression compared with organoids treated for only 24 hr across replicates , indicating that prolonged signaling manipulation does not improve the somite phenotype ( Figure 2D ) . Additionally , organoids initiated from 500 cells and then treated for 48 hr had a smaller diameter compared with organoids of the same initial cell number that were treated for only 24 hr ( Figure 2C ) . This suggests that long-term inhibition of WNT and/or FGF , known mitogenic signaling pathways , has detrimental effects on proliferation or cell survival . These results indicate that treatment of PSM-stage organoids with pathway modulators for 24 hr is sufficient to induce somite fate . Next , we set out to optimize the culture conditions to increase the number of somite-like structures in addition to the expression levels of the somite marker genes . We looked for morphological hallmarks of somite formation , specifically the formation of rosette-like structures consisting of radially arranged bottle-shaped PAX3+ epithelial cells with their NCAD+ apical surface facing a central cavity ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and B , Figure 3—video 1 ) . We used 500-cell spheroids as an initial starting point and compared two different inhibitor doses for FGF and WNT in addition to the other pathway modulators applied to PSM-stage organoids on day 3 . We characterized the organoids after treating them for 24 hr , 48 hr , and 24 hr followed by culture in basal media without any added factor for an additional 24 hr ( five organoids per condition , Figure 3A ) . In addition to quantifying PAX3 levels ( Figure 3D , Figure 3—figure supplement 2B ) , we also counted the number of somite-like structures per organoid ( Figure 3B and E , Figure 3—figure supplement 2A and B; see Materials and methods for a description of the scoring criteria ) . Comparing PAX3 expression levels in our treated organoids , we observed that somite fate can be broadly induced across a range of treatment regimes , concentrations , and types of WNT and/or FGF inhibitors ( Figure 3C and D , Figure 3—figure supplement 2C ) . However , the number of somite-like structures is not necessarily correlated with average PAX3 expression levels . For example , the numbers of somite-like structures in several conditions ( FGFRihi/PD173 , WNTihi/C59 , WNThi/C59+ FGFRilo , WNTihi/XAV ) were lower in organoids treated for 24 hr followed by culture in basal media for 24 hr compared with organoids that were treated with the same inhibitors for 48 hr , even though they exhibited higher PAX3 expression levels on average ( Figure 3D and E , Figure 3—figure supplement 2A ) . This suggests that marker gene expression alone may not be the best predictor when screening for morphologically complex phenotypes such as somite formation . Surprisingly , organoids that were cultured for an additional 24 hr ( day 3 to day 4 ) in FGF , WNT pathway agonist , and BMP inhibitor , considered a treatment control , followed by culture in basal media only for another 24 hr , consistently exhibited the highest number of somite-like structures across all organoid replicates ( Figure 3E , Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and B , Figure 3—figure supplement 2A and B , Figure 3—video 1 ) as well as technical replicates ( Figure 3—figure supplement 3A ) . Additionally , the average PAX3 expression was among the highest of all conditions tested ( Figure 3D ) . This suggests that simply removing FGF/WNT pathway agonists and BMP inhibitor , which maintain cells in a PSM state , is sufficient to reproducibly induce somite fate and morphological formation of somite-like structures ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2A , Figure 3—figure supplement 3A ) . Computing the variation of the number of somite-like structures across the five organoids confirmed that this phenotype was highly reproducible ( coefficient of variation = 11 . 1%; Figure 3—figure supplement 2B ) . Finally , our optimized protocol reproducibly yielded efficient induction of somite-like structures in multiple genetically independent hiPSC lines ( Figure 3—figure supplement 3B ) . Taken together , we determined that initiating the protocol with 500 cells and treating day 3 organoids with CL + FGF for 24 hr followed by culture in basal media for an additional 24 hr yield the most robust induction of somite-like structures while minimizing variation between experiments ( technical variation ) and different cell lines ( biological variation ) . This optimized differentiation protocol was therefore used for all subsequent experiments . To further characterize the developmental trajectory and transcriptional states of our Somitoid system , we collected 15 , 558 cells ( after postprocessing ) over the course of the optimized 5-day differentiation protocol at timepoints that capture the key transition steps ( day 1 , day 2 , day 3 , day 5 ) and performed scRNA-seq ( Figure 4A ) . Multiple organoids were used to obtain the required number of cells at each timepoint ( see Materials and methods ) . We first combined all the cells across the timepoints and clustered them using the Leiden clustering algorithm ( Traag et al . , 2019 ) . Predominantly , the four major clusters corresponded to cells from the four different timepoints . Therefore , cells at each timepoint have transcriptional states that are different compared with cells from the other timepoints . In addition , within each timepoint , cells exhibit similar transcriptional profiles as indicated by the uniformity of the expression levels of marker genes across individual cells ( Figure 4E , Figure 4—figure supplements 1–3 ) . Cells collected on day 1 exhibited gene expression profiles similar to primitive streak or NMps , expressing genes such as SOX2 , T/BRA , MIXL1 , and NODAL ( Figure 4C and E , Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) . Starting on day 2 , cells expressed canonical PSM marker genes such as TBX6 , MSGN1 , WNT3A , RSPO3 , and clock genes of the Notch signaling pathway including HES7 , LFNG , DLL1 , and DLL3 ( Figure 4C and E , Figure 4—figure supplement 2 ) . Day 5 cells expressed somite marker genes such as TCF15 , PAX3 , FOXC2 , and MEOX2 ( Figure 4C and E , Figure 4—figure supplement 3 ) . Interestingly , a subset of the day 5 cells also expressed somite polarity markers , UNCX and TBX18 , which suggests faithful recapitulation of somite patterning in Somitoids ( Figure 4C , Figure 4—figure supplement 3 ) . Furthermore , two of the subclusters ( ‘PSM-to-somite , ’ ‘early somite’ ) , which are characterized by co-expression of PSM and somite marker genes , comprised both day 3 and day 5 cells , indicating that the PSM-to-somite transition is captured in our in vitro system ( Figure 4A and B ) . Interestingly , one somite subcluster ( ‘late somite’ ) was enriched for myogenic genes ( MYL4/6/7/9 , TROPONIN L1 ) and sclerotome genes ( TWIST1 , COL1A1 , COL11A1 , COL7A1 , ACTA2 ) , suggesting that these cells represent more downstream fates of somite-derived cells ( Figure 4B , Figure 4—figure supplement 4A ) . Finally , we observed the expected sequential activation pattern of the HOX genes in our Somitoid system starting with HOXA1 on day 1 , followed by other cervical and thoracic HOX genes on days 2–3 , to HOXD9 , a lumbosacral HOX gene , in the somite-stage organoids ( day 5; Figure 4D , Figure 4—figure supplement 4B ) . Taken together , our scRNA-seq analyses show that our Somitoid system faithfully recapitulates the gene regulatory programs of human PM development and generates mature somite-like cells , which express the full repertoire of known marker genes . Furthermore , we did not detect cells of different developmental origins , suggesting that we are generating homogeneous organoids containing only PM derivatives . We next assessed whether our in vitro-derived somite-like structures show similar spatial organization and size distribution to their in vivo counterparts . To independently confirm some of the somite marker genes that we identified in our scRNA-seq dataset , we measured expression levels of TCF15/PARAXIS , PAX3 , and F-ACTIN in day 5 Somitoids using whole-mount immunostaining ( Figure 5A ) . Day 5 cells co-expressed both somite marker genes TCF15 and PAX3 throughout the Somitoid , and somite-like structures displayed apical localization of F-ACTIN . To determine whether in vitro-derived somite-like structures were similar in size to human embryonic segments , we compared them with Carnegie stage 9–11 early human somites ( Figure 5B; see Materials and methods for a description of how somite sizes were quantified ) . Organoid-derived somite-like structures were similar in size ( median area = 8892 µm2 , interquartile range [IQR] = 7698–10682 µm2 ) to Carnegie stage 11 somites ( median area = 9681 µm2 , IQR = 8262–11493 µm2 ) but larger than earlier-stage human somites ( Carnegie stage 9 somites , median area = 4399 µm2 , IQR = 4089–4433 µm2; Carnegie stage 10 somites , median area = 4704 µm2 , IQR = 4477–5343 µm2; see Figure 5B ) . Together , these results suggest that our organoid-derived somite-like structures share spatial and molecular features as well as overall size with their in vivo counterparts . Finally , we assessed whether Somitoids can give rise to downstream PM derivatives of sclerotome and dermomyotome . First , we differentiated Somitoids to sclerotome by exposing day 5 organoids to SHH agonist and WNT inhibitor to mimic the signaling environment of ventral somites in vivo ( Fan et al . , 1995; Fan and Tessier-Lavigne , 1994; Loh et al . , 2016 ) . After 3 days , the organoids showed a robust induction of canonical sclerotome marker genes such as PAX1 , SOX9 , and COL2A1 ( Figure 5C ) . Additionally , day 5 Somitoids were differentiated towards dermomyotome by exposing them to WNT/BMP agonists and SHH inhibitor for 48 hr followed by dissociation and culture on Matrigel as a monolayer in muscle differentiation medium ( Loh et al . , 2016; Matsuda et al . , 2020 ) to further differentiate them to skeletal muscle . Immunostaining for myosin heavy chain ( MYH1 , a myocyte/myotube marker ) confirmed that our Somitoid-derived cells can generate skeletal muscle derivatives in vitro ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) . These data demonstrate that our in vitro-induced somite-like structures maintain their ability to differentiate further into somitic mesoderm derivatives of the sclerotome and dermomytome lineages . 3 Discussion Here , we reported the generation of human PM organoids from hPSCs that reproduce important features of somitogenesis not previously captured in conventional monolayer differentiation cultures , most notably formation of somite-like structures . Using a simple suspension culture that does not require manual matrix embedding , we identified optimal differentiation conditions by systematically screening initial cell numbers and modulating the signaling factors . Importantly , our culture conditions are compatible with high-throughput screening approaches . Many established organoid protocols currently have limited applications because they are not reproducible . Therefore , we set out to identify the optimal differentiation conditions that minimized the variability between organoids as quantified by automated image analysis . One critical parameter we identified in our screens was the initial cell number used for aggregation . Our results suggest that if the initial cell number is above a certain threshold then somite fate cannot be induced in a homogeneous manner in our organoid system . This result is in line with previous findings in 3D models such as gastruloids , multi-axial self-organizing aggregates of mouse ES cells , which exhibit a higher degree of variability and multiple elongations when the number of initial cells exceeds a threshold ( Beccari et al . , 2018; van den Brink et al . , 2014 ) . Another important finding of our screens was that simply removing FGF , WNT pathway agonist as well as BMP inhibitor yielded the most reproducible and efficient somite-like structure-forming organoids . This treatment regime does not necessarily follow from applying prior in vivo and in vitro knowledge of somitogenesis . Previous protocols have used FGF and WNT inhibitors ( Matsuda et al . , 2020 ) or inhibition of all four candidate signaling pathways ( FGF , WNT , BMP , and TGF-β ) to induce somite fate ( Loh et al . , 2016 ) in monolayer cultured hiPSCs . While these conditions similarly induced somite fate marker genes in our 3D system , removal of FGF/WNT agonists and BMP inhibitor overall performed better as indicated by larger organoid diameters , higher average PAX3 expression levels , and higher number of somite-like structures . In line with these findings , our scRNA-seq analysis revealed that day 5 somite-like cells from our optimized protocol autonomously downregulate WNT target genes ( DKK1 , AXIN2 , WNT3A , RSPO3; Figure 4—figure supplement 2 ) and FGF target genes ( FGF8 , FGF17 , SPRY4 , DUSP6/MKP3 , SEF/IL17RD; Figure 4—figure supplement 5 ) . Finally , our screening results also suggest that focusing on marker gene induction as a phenotypic readout alone is not sufficient to optimize culture conditions of more complex organoid models such as somitogenesis . The scRNA-seq analysis of our hPSC-derived Somitoids independently confirmed our immunostaining and qRT-PCR results and showed that all major paraxial mesodermal cell types are generated , consistent with the cell types observed during PM development . Comparing our single-cell dataset with previously published in vitro-generated human PM transcriptomic data of monolayer cultures ( Diaz-Cuadros et al . , 2020; Matsuda et al . , 2020 ) reveals a similar pattern of activation of marker genes . Diaz-Cuadros and colleagues did not generate bona fide somitic cells as their final timepoint cell population does not express canonical somitic markers . Matsuda et al . indeed show expression of several somitic marker genes including TCF15 , MEOX1 , and PAX3 based on bulk RNA-seq data . Interestingly , our own analysis of day 5 somitic cells revealed multiple distinct subclusters , suggesting transcriptional heterogeneity within this population , which could have not been inferred from bulk data ( Figure 4B and C , Figure 4—figure supplement 4 ) . Importantly , neither of these papers report formation of somite-like structures , suggesting that transcriptional similarity alone is not sufficient to predict morphological features , in line with our screening results showing that average marker gene expression is not a good predictor of in vitro induction efficiency of somite-like structures ( Figure 3D and E , Figure 3—figure supplement 2A–C ) . While expression patterns of canonical somitic marker genes seem to be conserved in humans , it will be interesting to perform detailed gene expression analysis to identify putative human-specific genes of somite differentiation . Since our Somitoid system is reproducible , it could serve as a versatile platform to perform functional screens of human-specific or disease-relevant genes using CRISPR/Cas9 or small-molecule inhibitor libraries . Somitoids thus provide a powerful in vitro system for studying the regulation and dynamics of human somitogenesis , including somite formation . One limitation of this work is that the current protocol does not produce an AP axis and therefore does not generate somite-like structures in a bilaterally symmetric fashion as in the vertebrate embryo . A similar phenotype was recently reported in mouse gastruloids grown under similar signaling conditions that were embedded in Matrigel to promote self-organization into trunk-like structures ( TLS; Veenvliet et al . , 2020 ) . Chemical modulation of BMP and WNT signaling pathways in Matrigel-embedded gastruloids resulted in the formation of somite-like structures arranged like a bunch of grapes , similar to what we observed in our system . In standard culture conditions , gastruloids and TLS recapitulate the axial organization of the embryo , which is missing in our Somitoids ( Beccari et al . , 2018; Moris et al . , 2020; Veenvliet et al . , 2020 ) . To expand the patterning and morphogenetic potential of our Somitoid system , our approach could be combined with a microfluidics setup to generate spatio-temporally controlled morphogen gradients ( Manfrin et al . , 2019 ) . In summary , Somitoids provide a scalable , reproducible , and easy to manipulate platform to study molecular networks underlying the differentiation of PM , as well as the morphogenetic processes of somite formation . Furthermore , Somitoids represent a promising in vitro system to study congenital diseases that are linked to the human segmentation clock and somite formation , such as congenital scoliosis . 4 Materials and methods hiPSCs were maintained on Matrigel-coated plates ( Corning , Cat# 354277 ) in mTeSR1 media ( Stem Cell Technologies , 85870 ) using maintenance procedures developed by the Allen Institute for Cell Science ( https://www . coriell . org/1/AllenCellCollection ) . NCRM1 iPSCs were obtained from RUCDR Infinite Biologics , ACTB-GFP ( cell line ID: AICS-0016 cl . 184 ) fluorescent reporter iPSC line was obtained from the Allen Institute for Cell Science , and the WTC-11 ( GM25256 ) cell line was obtained from the Coriell Institute for Medical Research . All cell lines were tested for mycoplasma contamination . We verified cell line identity by immunostaining for pluripotency markers POU5F1 and SOX2 . For generation of PM organoids , 500 dissociated iPSCs resuspended in mTeSR1 media containing 10 µM Y-27362 dihydrochloride ( ROCKi; Tocris Bioscience , Cat# 1254 ) and 0 . 05% PVA were dispensed into 96-well U-bottom non-adherent suspension culture plates ( Greiner Bio-One , 650185 ) and allowed to aggregate for 24 hr . To induce PM differentiation , 24-hr-old pluripotent spheroids were subjected to CL media consisting of RHB Basal media ( Takara/Clontech , Cat# Y40000 ) , 5% KSR ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Cat# 10828028 ) with 10 µM CHIR99021 ( Sigma-Aldrich , Cat# SML1046 ) , 0 . 5 μM LDN193189 ( Stemgent , Cat# 04-0074 ) , and 5 µM ROCKi for the first 24 hr . Organoids were cultured in CL media without ROCKi from 24 to 72 hr of differentiation . On day 3 ( 72–120 hr ) , CL media was supplemented with 20 ng/ml FGF2 ( PeproTech , Cat# 450-33 ) . On day 4 , organoids were cultured in basal media only , without the addition of signaling factors . To further differentiate Somitoids towards sclerotome fate , day 5 somite-stage organoids were treated with 5 nM of Shh agonist SAG 21k ( Tocris , Cat# 5282 ) and 1 µM of Wnt inhibitor C59 for 3 days as previously described ( Loh et al . , 2016 ) . Organoids were subsequently differentiated towards cartilage by culturing them in the presence of 20 ng/ml BMP4 ( R&D Systems , Cat# 314 BP-010 ) for 6 days . To differentiate Somitoids towards dermomyotome , day 5 somite-stage organoids were treated with CHIR99021 ( 3 µM ) , GDC0449 ( 150 nM ) , and BMP4 ( 50 ng/ml ) for 48 hr as described previously ( Loh et al . , 2016; Matsuda et al . , 2020 ) . Day 7 organoids differentiated towards dermomyotome fate were dissociated with Accutase , resuspended in muscle induction medium containing ROCK inhibitor Y27632 and seeded ( 1 . 5–2 . 5 × 105 cells per well ) onto Matrigel-coated 12-well plates . To induce human skeletal muscle cells , we used an N2/horse-serum-containing induction medium as previously described ( Matsuda et al . , 2020 ) . In brief , DMEM/F12 containing GlutaMAX ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Cat# 10565018 ) , 1% insulin-transferrin-selenium ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Cat# 41400045 ) , 1% N-2 Supplement ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Cat# 17502-048 ) , 0 . 2 penicillin/streptomycin ( Sigma-Aldrich , Cat# P4333-100ML ) , and 2% horse serum ( Sigma-Aldrich , Cat# H1270-100ML ) . Medium was changed every other day . Day 45 cells were fixed in 4% PFA and immunostained for myosin heavy chain ( DSHB , MF20-c , 1:300 ) . For the systematic small-molecular inhibitor screen , PM organoids were generated and differentiated until day 3 ( PSM ) of our protocol . On day 3 , media was replaced with fresh media containing combinations of small-molecule inhibitors targeting the FGF , WNT , BMP , and TGF-β signaling pathways at indicated concentrations . For targeting the WNT pathway , we used C59 ( Tocris , Cat# 5148 ) , XAV939 ( Tocris , Cat# 3748 ) , and CHIR99021 ( Sigma-Aldrich , Cat# SML1046 ) . For inhibiting the FGF pathway , we used PD173074 ( Sigma-Aldrich , Cat# P2499 ) . For inhibiting the BMP pathway , we used LDN193189 ( Stemgent , Cat# 04-0074 ) . For inhibition of the TGF-β pathway , we used A-83-01 ( Tocris , Cat# 2939 ) . Media was changed daily . We analyzed three replicates per condition in the primary screen and five replicates per condition in the secondary screen . For organoid whole-mount immunostaining , organoids were collected in cold PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1–2 hr depending on size/stage . Organoids were washed in PBS and PBSFT ( PBS , 0 . 2% Triton X-100 , 10% FBS ) , and blocked in PBSFT + 3% normal donkey serum . Primary antibody incubation was performed in the blocking buffer overnight at 4°C on a rocking platform . After extensive washes in PBSFT , secondary antibody incubation ( 1:500 , all secondary antibodies were raised in donkey ) was performed overnight in PBSFT . Organoids were washed first in PBSFT and , for the final washes , were transferred to PBT ( PBS , 0 . 2% Triton X-100 , 0 . 2% BSA ) , followed by 50% glycerol in PBT and 70% glycerol in PBT prior to mounting . Hoechst ( 1:2000 ) was added to the last PBSFT wash . A list of primary antibodies is provided in Table S1 . All whole-mount immunostaining images were collected with a Nikon A1R point scanning confocal with spectral detection and resonant scanner on a Nikon Ti-E inverted microscope equipped with a Plan Apo VC ×20 objective ( NA 0 . 75 ) . Alexa-488 , Alexa-594 , Alexa-647 fluorophores coupled to secondary antibodies were excited with the 488 nm , 561 nm , and 647 nm laser lines from a Spectral Applied Research LMM-5 laser merge module with solid-state lasers ( selected with an AOTF ) and collected with a 405/488/561/647 quad dichroic mirror ( Chroma ) . For time-lapse experiments , images were acquired with a Yokagawa CSU-X1 spinning disk confocal on a Nikon Ti inverted microscope equipped with a Plan Apo ×20 objective ( NA 0 . 75 ) and a Hamamatsu Flash4 . 0 V3 sCMOS camera . Samples were grown on six-well glass-bottom multiwell plates with no . 1 . 5 glass ( Cellvis , Cat# P06-1 . 5H-N ) and mounted in a OkoLab 37°C , 5% CO2 cage microscope incubator warmed to 37°C . Images were collected every 15 min using an exposure time of 800 ms . At each timepoint , 30 z-series optical sections were collected with a step size of 2 µm . Multiple-stage positions were collected using a Prior Proscan II motorized stage . Z-series are displayed as maximum z-projections , and gamma , brightness , and contrast were adjusted ( identically for compared image sets ) using Fiji/ImageJ ( Schindelin et al . , 2012; https://imagej . net/Fiji ) . Automated image analysis , including background denoising , segmentation , and feature extraction , was done using ImageJ/Fiji macro language run in batch mode to process the entire screen dataset . First , binary masks were generated from the Hoechst ( nuclear stain ) channel by denoising the image ( Gaussian blur , sigma = 5 ) followed by applying Li’s Minimum Cross Entropy thresholding method ( Li and Tam , 1998 ) and refining binary masks through several rounds of erosion/dilation steps . Next , binary masks were converted to selections and added to the region of interest ( ROI ) Manager . Finally , ROIs were used to perform diameter measurements of organoids . For Pax3 measurements , Hoechst and Pax3 channels were first denoised using a Gaussian blur filter ( sigma = 10 ) and then used to create a normalized Pax3 image by dividing the Pax3 channel with the Hoechst channel . Next , ROIs based on Hoechst binary masks were applied to the Pax3 normalized image to extract fluorescence intensity measurements for each z-slice . Finally , mean Pax3 intensity values for each organoid were calculated and compared . For the primary and secondary screens , images were acquired on a Nikon A1R point scanning confocal microscope . For each organoid , 66 z-series optical sections were collected with a step size of 2 µm . Quantification of somite-like structures for the secondary screen was done by blinded manual scoring , considering the following criteria: Carnegie stage 9–11 human embryonic somite data was obtained from the Virtual Human Embryo Project ( https://www . ehd . org/virtual-human-embryo/ ) . Somite sizes of human embryos were measured using the Ruler Tool on the Virtual Human Embryo website along the mediolateral and dorsoventral axis of the embryo . The slice with the largest diameter of each somite was used for measurements . Sizes of somite-like structures of day 5 organoids were measured along the X and Y axes of the image since , unlike in the embryo , they do not exhibit morphological anisotropies . Somite areas were approximated by using the two diameter measurements from each somite-like structure to calculate the area of the resulting rectangle . Organoids were harvested in Trizol ( Life Technologies , Cat# 15596-018 ) , followed by precipitation with chloroform and ethanol and transfer onto PureLink RNA Micro Kit columns ( Thermo Fisher , Cat# 12183016 ) according to the manufacturer’s protocol , including on-column DNase treatment . A volume of 22 µl RNase-free water was used for elution , and RNA concentration was measured with a Qubit Fluorometer . Typically , between 0 . 2 and 1 µg of RNA was reverse transcribed using Superscript III First Strand Synthesis kit ( Life Technologies , Cat# 18080-051 ) and oligo-dT primers to generate cDNA libraries . For real-time quantitative PCR , cDNA was diluted 1:30-1:50 in water and qPCR was performed using the iTaq Universal SYBR Green kit ( Bio-Rad , Cat# 1725124 ) . Each gene-specific primer and sample mix was run in triple replicates . Each 10 µl reaction contained 5 µl 2X SYBR Green Master Mix , 0 . 4 µl of 10 µM primer stock ( 1:1 mix of forward and reverse primers ) , and 4 . 6 µl of diluted cDNA . qPCR plates were run on a Roche LightCycler 480 Real-Time PCR system with the following cycling parameters: initial denaturation step ( 95°C for 1 min ) , 40 cycles of amplification and SYBR green signal detection ( denaturation at 95°C for 5 s , annealing/extension and plate read at 60°C for 40 s ) , followed by final rounds of gradient annealing from 65 to 95°C to generate dissociation curves . Primer sequences are listed in Supplementary file 2 , Table S2 . All unpublished primers were validated by checking for specificity ( single peak in melting curve ) and linearity of amplification ( serially diluted cDNA samples ) . For relative gene expression analysis , the ΔΔCt method was implemented using the R package ‘pcr’ ( https://cran . r-project . org/web/packages/pcr/ ) . PP1A was used as the housekeeping gene in all cases . Target gene expression is expressed as fold-change relative to undifferentiated iPSCs . Cell dissociation protocols were optimized to achieve single-cell suspensions with >90% viable cells and low number of doublets . Organoids collected at days 1 , 2 , 3 , and 5 of our differentiation protocol were pooled in prewarmed PBS , transferred to prewarmed Accutase , and incubated for 5–7 min at 37°C . For day 1 organoid cell suspension , 30 organoids were pooled . For day 2 organoid cell suspension , 15 organoids were pooled . For day 3 cell suspension , eight organoids were pooled . For day 5 cell suspension , five organoids were pooled . Organoids were briefly rinsed in PBS , then transferred to 500 µl PBS/0 . 05% BSA and carefully triturated to generate a single-cell suspension . Cell suspension was run through a cell strainer ( Falcon , Cat# 352235 ) and transferred to a 1 . 5 ml tube . Cells were spun down at 250 × g for 3 min at 4°C . Cell pellet was resuspended in 25 µl PBS/0 . 05% BSA , cell concentration and viability were measured using an automated cell counter , and cell suspension was further diluted as appropriate to reach the optimal range for 10× ( 700–1200 cells per µl ) . Cells were subjected to scRNA-seq ( 10X Genomics , Chromium Single Cell 3’ v3 ) aiming for the following target cell numbers: day 1 , 3000 cells; day 2 , 4000 cells; day 3 , 5000 cells; day 5 , 6000 cells . Estimated actual cell numbers collected were day 1 , 2930 cells; day 2 , 4977 cells; day 3 , 5968 cells; day 5 , 4841 cells . Single-cell libraries were generated using standard protocols . Libraries were sequenced together on a NovaSeq 6000 system resulting in 800 million reads . Statistics and plots were generated using R version 4 . 0 . 2 ‘Taking Off Again’ and Seurat version 3 . 0 ( Stuart et al . , 2019 ) . Cell Ranger pipeline ( 10X Genomics , version 4 . 0 . 0 ) was used to demultiplex the raw base call files , generate FASTQ files , perform the alignment against the human reference genome ( GRCh38 1 . 2 . 0 ) , and generate the count matrices . For the initial QC , we determined the following thresholds for filtering out low-quality cells: UMI counts less than 500 , gene counts less than 200 , mitochondrial fraction above 0 . 2 , and a complexity score of less than 0 . 8 ( calculated as log10 ( genes ) /log10 ( UMIs ) ) . After QC filtering , we normalized our dataset using the sctransform ( Hafemeister and Satija , 2019 ) framework , which is part of the Seurat package . To regress out confounding variation in our dataset , we performed cell cycle scoring and determined mitochondrial mapping percentage using standard workflows . Next , we performed principal component analysis and determined the K-nearest neighbor graph using the first 40 principal components . We then applied the Leiden clustering algorithm using a parameter range from 0 . 1 to 1 . 0 to determine the best resolution/number of clusters , which reflected biological differences ( FindClusters , resolution = 0 . 1–1 . 0 ) . Clusters were visualized on a Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection ( UMAP ) embedding ( RunUMAP , dims = 1:40 ) . To determine optimal resolution for clustering and assign cell types for each cluster , we visualized sets of known marker genes for each predicted cell type on UMAP plots . Prior to marker gene identification and final assignments of cluster identities , we also checked additional quality control metrics ( UMI count , gene count , mitochondrial gene ratio ) to exclude low-quality clusters from downstream analyses . Through iterative analysis , we determined Leiden clustering with resolution = 0 . 8 , resulting in 22 clusters , to best capture biological variation of the dataset . Using a combination of quality control metrics and unbiased marker gene identification for each cluster ( see below ) , we excluded seven smaller low-quality clusters ( as determined by QC metrics and/or expression of stress signature genes ) from further downstream analysis ( 15 clusters after filtering ) . Marker genes for every cluster were identified by a two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test comparing cells from each cluster to all other cells in the combined dataset . Genes were considered differentially expressed if the log2 fold-change average expression in the cluster is equal to or greater than 0 . 25 relative to the average expression in all other clusters combined , and the adjusted p-value<0 . 05 . Multiple comparison correction was performed using the Bonferroni method . Identified marker genes for the top 20 differentially expressed transcripts are listed in Figure 4—figure supplement 4A . The full list of differentially expressed genes , ranked by adjusted p-values and associated fold-changes , is provided in Supplementary file 1 , Table S1 ."}
{"doi": "elife-72619-v2", "abstract": "While mRNA vaccines are proving highly efficacious against SARS-CoV-2 , it is important to determine how booster doses and prior infection influence the immune defense they elicit , and whether they protect against variants . Focusing on the T cell response , we conducted a longitudinal study of infection-naïve and COVID-19 convalescent donors before vaccination and after their first and second vaccine doses , using a high-parameter CyTOF analysis to phenotype their SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells . Vaccine-elicited spike-specific T cells responded similarly to stimulation by spike epitopes from the ancestral , B . 1 . 1 . 7 and B . 1 . 351 variant strains , both in terms of cell numbers and phenotypes . In infection-naïve individuals , the second dose boosted the quantity and altered the phenotypic properties of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells , while in convalescents the second dose changed neither . Spike-specific T cells from convalescent vaccinees differed strikingly from those of infection-naïve vaccinees , with phenotypic features suggesting superior long-term persistence and ability to home to the respiratory tract including the nasopharynx . These results provide reassurance that vaccine-elicited T cells respond robustly to emerging viral variants , confirm that convalescents may not need a second vaccine dose , and suggest that vaccinated convalescents may have more persistent nasopharynx-homing SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells compared to their infection-naïve counterparts .", "plain language summary": "Vaccination is one of the best ways to prevent severe COVID-19 . Two doses of mRNA vaccine protect against serious illness caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 . They do this , in part , by encouraging the immune system to make specialised proteins known as antibodies that recognise the virus . Most of the vaccine research so far has focussed on these antibodies , but they are only one part of the immune response . Vaccines also activate immune cells called T cells . These cells have two main roles , coordinating the immune response and killing cells infected with viruses . It is likely that they play a key role in preventing severe COVID-19 . There are many kinds of T cells , each with a different role . Currently , the identity and characteristics of the T cells that protect against COVID-19 is unclear . Different types of T cells have unique proteins on their surface . Examining these proteins can reveal details about how the T cells work , which part of the virus they recognise , and which part of the body they protect . A tool called cytometry by time of flight allows researchers to measure these proteins , one cell at a time . Using this technique , Neidleman , Luo et al . investigated T cells from 11 people before vaccination and after their first and second doses . Five people had never had COVID-19 before , and six had already recovered from COVID-19 . Neidleman , Luo et al . found that the T cells recognizing SARS-CoV-2 in the two groups differed . In people who had never had COVID-19 before , the second dose of vaccine improved the quality and quantity of the T cells . The same was not true for people who had already recovered from COVID-19 . However , although their T cells did not improve further after a second vaccine dose , they did show signs that they might offer more protection overall . The proteins on the cells suggest that they might last longer , and that they might specifically protect the nose , throat and lungs . Neidleman , Luo et al . also found that , for both groups , T cells activated by vaccination responded in the same way to different variants of the virus . This work highlights the importance of getting both vaccine doses for people who have never had COVID-19 . It also suggests that vaccination in people who have had COVID-19 may generate better T cells . Larger studies could show whether these patterns remain true across the wider population . If so , it is possible that delivering vaccines to the nose or throat could boost immunity by mimicking natural infection . This might encourage T cells to make the surface proteins that allow them to home to these areas .", "article": "1 Introduction A year and a half since the December 2019 emergence of SARS-CoV-2 , the novel betacoronavirus had already infected almost 200 million people and taken the lives of over 4 million , nearly collapsed worldwide health systems , disrupted the global economy , and perturbed society and public health on a scale not experienced within the past 100 years . Fortunately , multiple highly efficacious vaccines , including the two-dose mRNA-based ones developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna , which confer ~90 % protection against disease , were approved for emergency use before the end of 2020 . Although the vaccines provide the most promising route for a rapid exit from the COVID-19 pandemic , concerns remain regarding the durability of the immunity elicited by these vaccines and the extent to which they will protect against the variants of SARS-CoV-2 now spreading rapidly around the world . The first variant observed to display a survival advantage was the D614G , which was more transmissible than the original strain and quickly became the dominant variant throughout the world Korber et al . , 2020 . This variant , fortunately , did not evade immunity and in fact appeared to be more sensitive than the original strain to antibody neutralization by convalescent sera Weissman et al . , 2021 . More worrisome , however , was the emergence at the end of 2020 of rapidly spreading variants in multiple parts of the world , including B . 1 . 1 . 7 , B . 1 . 351 , P . 1 , and B . 1 . 427/B . 1 . 429 ( originally identified in United Kingdom , South Africa , Brazil , and California , respectively ) Plante et al . , 2021 , followed by additional highly transmissible variants in 2021 including the B . 1 . 617 . 2 which was first detected in India Callaway , 2021 . Some variants , including B . 1 . 1 . 7 , may be more virulent Davies et al . , 2021 . While antibodies against the original strain elicited by either vaccination or infection generally remain potent against B . 1 . 1 . 7 , their activity against B . 1 . 351 and P . 1 is compromised Wang et al . , 2021; The CITIID-NIHR BioResource COVID-19 Collaboration et al . , 2021; Muik et al . , 2021; Garcia-Beltran et al . , 2021; Stamatatos et al . , 2021; Cele et al . , 2021; Hoffmann et al . , 2021; Planas et al . , 2021; Edara et al . , 2021; Kuzmina et al . , 2021 . Antibodies from vaccinees were 14-fold less effective against B . 1 . 351 than against the ancestral strain , and a subset of individuals completely lacked neutralizing antibody activity against B . 1 . 351 9 months or more after convalescence Planas et al . , 2021 . Reassuringly , early data suggest that relative to antibody responses , T-cell-mediated immunity appears to be less prone to evasion by the variants Skelly et al . , 2021; Tarke et al . , 2021; Redd et al . , 2021; Geers et al . , 2021; Woldemeskel et al . , 2021; Stankov et al . , 2021; Tauzin et al . , 2021 . Among 280 CD4+ and 523 CD8+ T cell epitopes from the original SARS-CoV-2 , an average of 91 . 5 % ( for CD4 ) and 98 . 1 % ( for CD8 ) mapped to regions not mutated in the B . 1 . 1 . 7 , B1 . 351 , P . 1 , and B . 1 . 427/B . 1 . 429 variants . Focusing on just the spike response , the sole SARS-CoV-2 antigen in the mRNA-based vaccines , then 89 . 7 % of the CD4+ epitopes and 96 . 4 % of the CD8+ epitopes are conserved Tarke et al . , 2021 . In line with this , the magnitude of the response of T cells from convalescent or vaccinated individuals was not markedly reduced when assessed against any of the variants Tarke et al . , 2021 . The relative resistance of T cells against SARS-CoV-2 immune evasion is important in light of the critical role these immune effectors play during COVID-19 . T cell numbers display a strong , inverse association with disease severity Chen et al . , 2020; Woodruff et al . , 2020 , and the frequency of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells predicts recovery from severe disease Rydyznski Moderbacher et al . , 2020; Neidleman et al . , 2021 . SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells can also provide long-term , self-renewing immunological memory: these cells are detected more than half a year into convalescence and can proliferate in response to homeostatic signals Dan et al . , 2021; Neidleman et al . , 2020b . Furthermore , the ability of individuals with inborn deficiencies in B cell responses to recover from COVID-19 without intensive care suggests that the combination of T cells and innate immune mechanisms is sufficient for recovery when antibodies are lacking Soresina et al . , 2020 . Although T cells against the ancestral strain display a response of similar magnitude and breadth to the variants Tarke et al . , 2021 , to what extent these T cells’ phenotypes and effector functions differ during their response to variant detection is a different question . Small changes in the sequences of T cell epitopes , in the form of altered peptide ligands ( APLs ) , can theoretically alter how the T cells respond to stimulation . Indeed , change of a single residue can convert a proliferative , IL4-secreting effector response into one that continues to produce IL4 in the absence of proliferation Evavold and Allen , 1991 . Furthermore , APLs can activate Th1 cells without inducing either proliferation or cytokine production , shift Th1 responses into Th2-focused ones , and in some instances even render T cells anergic or immunoregulatory by eliciting TGFβ production Sloan-Lancaster and Allen , 1996 . Another important aspect that has not been explored is to what extent vaccine- vs . infection-induced T cell responses differ phenotypically and functionally , and to what extent convalescent individuals benefit from vaccination as they already harbor some form of immunity against the virus . Studies based on the antibody and B cell response suggest that for COVID-19 convalescents , a single dose of the mRNA vaccines is helpful while the additional booster is not necessary Stamatatos et al . , 2021; Goel et al . , 2021; Ebinger et al . , 2021; how this translates in the context of vaccine-elicited T cell immunity is not clear . To address these knowledge gaps , we conducted 39-parameter phenotyping by CyTOF on 33 longitudinal specimens from 11 mRNA-vaccinated individuals , six of whom had previously contracted and recovered from COVID-19 . For each participant , blood specimens were obtained prior to vaccination , two weeks following the first dose , and two weeks following the second . For every specimen , we assessed in depth the phenotypes and effector functions of total CD4+ and CD8+ T cells , and of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells responding to the original SARS-CoV-2 spike , to spike from variants B . 1 . 1 . 7 and B . 1 . 351 , and to nucleocapsid . By conducting analyses on the resulting 165 high-dimensional datasets generated , we find a reassuringly unaltered T cell response against the variants , an ability of the booster dose to alter the phenotypes of vaccine-elicited T cells , and a striking impact of prior infection on qualitative features of T cells elicited by vaccination . 2 Results To characterize the phenotypic features of mRNA vaccination-elicited SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells , we procured 33 longitudinal blood samples from the COVID-19 Host Immune Response and Pathogenesis ( CHIRP ) cohort . Four of the participants had received the Moderna ( mRNA-1273 ) vaccine , while the remaining seven had received the Pfizer/BioNTech ( BNT162b2 ) one . For all participants , longitudinal specimens were obtained at three timepoints: prior to vaccination , ~ 2 weeks ( range 13–18 days ) after the first vaccine dose , and ~2 weeks ( range 6–38 days ) after the second dose . Five of the participants were never infected with SARS-CoV-2 , while the remaining six had completely recovered from mild ( non-hospitalized ) COVID-19 disease ( Table 1 ) . These prior infections had all occurred in the San Francisco Bay Area between March and July of 2020 , when the dominant local strain was the original ancestral strain . Each specimen was phenotyped using a 39-parameter T cell-centric CyTOF panel ( see Materials and methods and Table 2 ) at baseline ( to establish the overall phenotypes of total CD4+ and CD8+ T cells ) , and following 6 hr of stimulation with overlapping 15-mer peptides spanning the entire original ( ancestral ) SARS-CoV-2-spike , B . 1 . 1 . 7 spike , B . 1 . 351 spike , or the original SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid ( the latter as a control for a SARS-CoV-2-specific response not boosted by vaccination ) . Including all the baseline and stimulation conditions , a total of 165 specimens from the 11 participants were analyzed by CyTOF . We first confirmed our ability to identify SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells by stimulating PBMCs from vaccinated individuals with spike peptides . In line with our prior studies implementing a 6 hr peptide stimulation Neidleman et al . , 2021; Neidleman et al . , 2020b , spike-specific CD4+ T cells could be specifically identified through intracellular cytokine staining for IFNγ , and a more robust response was observed among CD4+ than CD8+ T cells ( Figure 1 ) . No specific induction of IL4 or IL17 by CD4+ T cells were observed in response to peptide stimulation ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . In addition , activation-induced markers ( AIM ) such as Ox40 , 4-1BB , and CD69 could also be identified in T cells after spike peptide stimulation , but with a higher background in the baseline ( no peptide stimulation ) specimens relative to the intracellular cytokine staining approach ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . For these reasons , in this study we exclusively used IFNγ positivity in the peptide-stimulated samples as a marker of antigen-specific T cells . In the infection-naïve participants , the first vaccination dose primed a spike-specific CD4+ T cell response , which was further boosted with the second dose ( Figure 1B , top left ) . For each participant and time point , similar numbers of cells were stimulated by exposure to the ancestral or variant spikes . This finding suggests that vaccine-elicited spike-specific CD4+ T cells recognize ancestral and variant spike equally well , and is consistent with their recently reported ability to recognize variant strains Tarke et al . , 2021 . The response of vaccine-elicited CD8+ T cells to spike peptides was weaker , and mostly apparent only after the second dose ( Figure 1B , top right ) . As expected , vaccination did not elicit T cells able to respond to nucleocapsid peptides ( Figure 1C , top panels ) . In contrast to the infection-naïve individuals where spike-specific CD4+ T cells were clearly elicited and then boosted upon the second dose , spike-specific CD4+ T cell responses in convalescent individuals did not show a consistent upward trend . Convalescent donor PID4112 had a large frequency of pre-vaccination SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells that increased to >1% of the total CD4+ T cell frequency after the first dose and then dampened after dose 2 ( Figure 1B , bottom left ) . PID4112 also exhibited an elevated nucleocapsid-specific CD4+ T cell response after the first vaccination dose ( Figure 1C , bottom left ) , which may have been due to bystander effects resulting from the concomitant large spike-specific response . In comparison , PID4112’s spike-specific CD8+ T cell response was low after dose 1 , and boosted after dose 2 ( Figure 1B , bottom right ) . In contrast to PID4112 , the remaining five convalescent donors exhibited an overall weak spike-specific T cell response . In fact , when comparing these five donors to the five infection-naïve donors , there was a significant decrease in the magnitude of the spike-specific CD4+ T cell response , while the spike-specific CD8+ T cell response was equivalent between the two groups ( Figure 1D ) . These results were unexpected and suggest that , when excluding outlier PID4112 , the magnitude of the vaccine-elicited spike-specific CD4+ T cell response ( after full vaccination ) was lower in convalescent individuals than in infection-naïve individuals . These assessments of the magnitude of the spike-specific T cell response together suggest that ( 1 ) in infection-naïve individuals the CD4+ T cell response is boosted by the second vaccination dose , ( 2 ) convalescent individuals exhibit a more disparate response , with most donors mounting a weaker response than infection-naïve individuals , and ( 3 ) the response is more robust among CD4+ than CD8+ T cells . As a higher number of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells were available for analysis , we focused on this subset for our subsequent analyses . Leveraging our ability to not only assess the magnitude but also the detailed ( 39-parameter ) phenotypic features of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells , we first determined whether the ancestral and variant spike epitopes stimulated different subsets of vaccine-elicited spike-specific CD4+ T cells . Such differences could theoretically result from the fact that ~5–10% of the spike epitopes differ between variants and ancestral strains Tarke et al . , 2021 , and may therefore act as APLs steering responding cells towards different fates . We isolated the datasets corresponding to both post-vaccination timepoints for all eleven donors , and then exported the data corresponding to spike-specific CD4+ T cells ( as defined by IFNγ production , Figure 1 ) . After reducing the multidimensional single-cell data for each individual specimen to a two-dimensional datapoint through multidimensional scaling ( MDS ) Ritchie et al . , 2015 , we observed the ancestral spike-stimulated samples to be interspersed among the B . 1 . 1 . 7- and B . 1 . 351-responding ones ( Figure 2A ) . We then visualized the spike-specific CD4+ T cells at the single-cell level . When visualized alongside total ( baseline ) CD4+ T cells , spike-specific cells occupied a distinct ‘island’ defined by high expression of IFNγ ( Figure 2B ) , suggesting unique phenotypic features of these cells . To better analyze these spike-responding CD4+ T cells , we visualized them in isolation within a new tSNE which clearly demonstrated complete mixing of the cells stimulated by the ancestral , B . 1 . 1 . 7 , and B . 1 . 351 spike proteins ( Figure 2C ) . Almost all the responding cells expressed high levels of CD45RO and low levels of CD45RA ( Figure 2D ) , suggesting them to be mostly memory cells . These memory CD4+ T cells included central memory T cells ( Tcm ) , T follicular helper cells ( Tfh ) , and those expressing multiple activation markers ( CD38 , HLADR , CD69 , CD25 ) and receptors known to direct cells to tissues including the respiratory tract ( CXCR4 , CCR5 , CCR6 , CD49d ) ( Figure 2E ) . The expression levels of these and all other antigens quantitated by CyTOF were not statistically different between CD4+ T cells responding to the three spike proteins ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) . To confirm the identical phenotypes of the three groups of spike-responding cells , we implemented unbiased clustering by FlowSOM . Spike-stimulated cells were clustered into eight subsets , and no subset was preferentially enriched in any one of the three groups ( Figure 2F ) . Together , these data suggest that vaccine-elicited spike-specific CD4+ T cells respond in the same manner to spike epitopes from the ancestral or variant strains , and would probably mount similar responses in vivo to infection by all three virus types . We next took advantage of our longitudinal study design to assess for any changes in the differentiation of spike-specific T cell responses over the course of the 2-dose vaccination . As the data presented above suggested no phenotypic differences between CD4+ T cells responding to the ancestral , B . 1 . 1 . 7 , and B . 1 . 351 spike proteins , our subsequent analyses combined these datasets . We first assessed whether , among infection-naïve individuals , the phenotypes of spike-specific CD4+ T cells were different after the first and second doses . While MDS and tSNE visualizations of the data revealed that the cells from the two timepoints were somewhat interspersed ( Figure 3A-B ) , FlowSOM clustering suggested some differences in cluster distribution ( Figure 3C-D ) . Direct comparison of the cluster frequencies revealed a cluster ( B8 ) significantly enriched after the first dose , and a different cluster ( B5 ) significantly enriched after the second dose ( Figure 3E ) . As these two clusters differentially expressed the Tcm markers CD27 and CCR7 ( Figure 3F ) , we then assessed whether Tcm cells were differentially represented among spike-specific CD4+ T cells after each of the vaccination doses . Indeed , Tcm cells were significantly higher after the first dose ( Figure 3G ) , consistent with Cluster 8 ( enriched after the first dose ) expressing high levels of these two receptors . Assessment of other canonical CD4+ T cell subsets – in particular naïve ( Tn ) , stem cell memory ( Tscm ) , effector memory RA ( Temra ) , effector memory ( Tem ) , T transitional memory ( Ttm ) , Tfh , and regulatory T cells ( Treg ) – revealed Tn cells , like the Tcm subset , to be decreased after the second dose . By contrast , Ttm cells were found to be higher after the second dose , while the remaining subsets were not altered ( Figure 3G-H ) . Overall , Tcm and Tfh were the most abundant subsets among the spike-specific CD4+ T cells ( Figure 3G-H ) . These data together suggest that after receiving the second dose , infection-naïve individuals’ spike-specific CD4+ T cells increase in quantity ( Figure 1B ) , and alter their phenotypes as reflected by a decrease Tcm cells and an increase in Ttm cells . We then conducted a similar analysis in the convalescent individuals . As the pre-vaccination timepoint included spike-specific CD4+ T cells primed by prior SARS-CoV-2 infection , we included all three timepoints in this analysis . When the data were visualized by MDS , it was apparent that most of the pre-vaccination specimens localized away from the post-vaccination specimens , which were interspersed with each other ( Figure 4A ) . Similar distinctions between pre-and post-vaccination specimens were visualized at the single-cell level by tSNE , which was particularly apparent when visualized as contour heatmaps ( Figure 4B and C ) . Clustering of the cells by FlowSOM revealed that the cluster distribution was markedly skewed among the pre-vaccination cells ( Figure 4D and E ) , with one cluster being under-represented ( C2 ) and one over-represented ( C5 ) as compared to both post-vaccination timepoints ( Figure 4F ) . Cluster C3 was the only cluster that was significantly different after 1 vs 2 doses ( Figure 4F ) but as this cluster comprised only <5 % of the cells it was not analyzed further . To assess what may drive the differences between the phenotypes of the pre- vs . post-vaccination spike-specific CD4+ T cells , we assessed for markers differentially expressed between clusters C2 and C5 . Cluster C2 cells preferentially expressed the Tcm markers CD27 and CCR7 , the Tfh markers PD1 and CXCR5 , and the co-stimulatory receptors ICOS and Ox40 , while among these only CD27 was preferentially expressed in Cluster C5 ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) . Manual gating confirmed Tcm , Tfh , and ICOS+ Ox40+ cells to be preferentially enriched in the post-vaccination specimens ( Figure 4G-I ) . None of the canonical subsets were differentially abundant after the first vs . second vaccination dose . Together , these results suggest that , in contrast to the infection-naïve individuals , convalescents’ spike-specific CD4+ T cells were similar after the first vs . second vaccination dose; however , in these individuals vaccination drastically altered the phenotypes of the pre-existing spike-specific CD4+ T cells ( presumably elicited from the original infection ) . We next determined whether there were any phenotypic differences between the vaccine-induced spike-specific CD4+ T cells from the infection-naïve vs . convalescent individuals . Removal of convalescent outlier PID4112 revealed the magnitude of the spike-specific CD4+ T cell response to be lower in the convalescents than in infection-naïve participants after full vaccination ( Figure 1D ) . But when all donors were included there was no statistically significant difference in response magnitude ( Figure 5A ) . However , the spike-specific CD4+ T cells from the convalescent and infection-naïve individuals exhibited clear phenotypic differences when assessed by both MDS ( Figure 5B ) and tSNE contours ( Figure 5C ) ; this was more apparent after the second vaccine dose , but could already be observed after the first . Since the cells after the second dose are more clinically relevant ( as they are the ones persisting in vaccinated individuals moving forward ) , we focused our subsequent analysis on just this timepoint . When visualized as a dot plot , it was apparent that the spike-specific CD4+ T cells from infection-naïve individuals segregated away from those from the convalescents ( Figure 5D ) . Clustering of the data also demonstrated differences between the two patient groups ( Figure 5E and F ) , which was confirmed by demonstration of a significant difference in Cluster A1 abundance ( Figure 5G ) . To identify these phenotypic differences , we first assessed the relative distributions of the main canonical CD4+ T cell subsets . Interestingly , the vaccinated convalescents harbored significantly more spike-specific Tcm and Tn , and less spike-specific Ttm ( Figure 6A ) . By contrast , Tfh and Treg frequencies were not different between infection-naïve and convalescent vaccinees ( Figure 6B ) . To broaden our analysis , we assessed for unique features of Cluster A1 , which was over-represented in the infection-naïve donors , and Cluster A3 , an abundant cluster which was over-represented in the convalescent donors albeit insignificantly ( Figure 5G ) . Interestingly , Cluster A1 expressed low levels of CD127 , CXCR4 , and CCR7 in contrast to Cluster A3 ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1A ) . As Cluster A1 is enriched among the infection-naïve individuals , these findings suggest that these three receptors may be expressed at lower levels on the cells from these individuals , relative to those from vaccinated convalescents . This was confirmed by our detection of higher expression of CD127 , CXCR4 , and CCR7 on spike-specific CD4+ T cells from the convalescents , although for CXCR4 the difference did not reach statistical significance ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1B ) . We then followed up on each of these three differentially expressed markers . CD127 , the alpha chain of the IL7 receptor , can drive IL7-mediated homeostatic proliferation of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells Neidleman et al . , 2020b , and serves as a marker of long-lived precursor memory cells Kaech et al . , 2003 . To assess the potential longevity of the spike-specific CD4+ T cells , we determined the percentage of CD127+ cells expressing low levels of the terminal differentiation marker CD57 . After the second dose of vaccination , convalescent individuals harbored more long-lived ( CD127+ CD57- ) spike-specific CD4+ T cells than infection-naïve individuals ( Figure 6C ) . CXCR4 , the second preferentially-expressed marker among the convalescents’ spike-specific CD4+ T cells , was recently suggested to direct bystander T cells to the lung during COVID-19 , and to be co-expressed with the T resident memory / activation marker CD69 Neidleman et al . , 2021 . Interestingly , spike-specific CD4+ T cells from convalescent donors harbored a highly significantly elevated proportion of CXCR4+ CD69+ cells ( Figure 6D ) , suggesting a potentially superior ability to migrate into pulmonary tissues . The last differentially expressed antigen , CCR7 , is a chemokine receptor that directs immune cells to lymph nodes . As CD62L , a selectin that also mediates lymph node homing , was also on our panel , we assessed whether CCR7+ CD62L+ cells were enriched among the spike-specific CD4+ T cells from the convalescent donors , and found this to be the case ( Figure 6E ) . Our finding that the convalescent donors’ spike-specific CD4+ T cells were preferentially CXCR4+ CD69+ and CCR7+ CD62L + suggested that they may preferentially migrate out of the blood into lymphoid tissues . Supporting this possibility was our observation that , after the second vaccine dose , the percentages of CCR7+ CD62L + spike-specific cells increased as the percentages of spike-specific CD4+ T cells decreased ( Figure 6F ) . This suggests that the low spike-specific CD4+ T cell response after the second dose of vaccination in some convalescent donors ( Figure 1D ) may have resulted from these cells preferentially leaving the blood compartment . This was further supported by our finding that the expression levels of CCR7 and CD62L on spike-specific CD4+ T cells inversely correlated with the magnitude of the spike-specific CD4+ T cell response ( Figure 6G ) . To assess whether the CCR7+ CD62L + and CXCR4+ CD69+ CD4+ T cells have the potential to migrate into the nasopharynx , the most common site of SARS-CoV-2 entry , we obtained paired blood and nasal swabs from one of the participants ( PID4101 ) and phenotyped total CD4+ T cells isolated from these specimens . There was a marked enrichment of both CCR7+ CD62L + and CXCR4+ CD69+ CD4+ T cells in the intranasal specimens ( Figure 6H ) , suggesting that CD4+ T cells expressing these markers preferentially exit the blood and enter the nasopharynx . Together , these data suggest that after vaccination , spike-specific CD4+ T cells from convalescent individuals differ from those in infection-naïve individuals in that they appear to be more long-lived , and may more readily migrate out of the blood to mucosal sites , thus explaining their overall lower frequencies measured from the blood . Finally , we assessed to what extent the main similarities and differences observed with spike-specific CD4+ T cells were also seen for spike-specific CD8+ T cells . Similar to the CD4+ T cells , spike-specific CD8+ T cells stimulated by the three different spike proteins ( ancestral , B . 1 . 1 . 7 , B . 1 . 351 ) did not differ in their phenotypic features ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1A-C ) . Also similar to the CD4+ T cells , spike-specific CD8+ T cells elicited by vaccination differed phenotypically in the infection-naïve vs . convalescent individuals ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1D-F ) . Unlike the CD4+ T cell data , however , these phenotypic differences could not be accounted for by distribution changes among the main canonical subsets Tn , Tscm , Temra , Tcm , Tem , and Ttm ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1G ) . Also unlike the CD4+ T cells , these differences were also not explained by differential abundance of the CD127+ CD57- , CXCR4+ CD69+ , or CCR7+ CD62L + subsets ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1H ) . Instead , the differences appear to be due to other phenotypic changes , including elevated frequencies of activated cells in the convalescent donors , in particular those co-expressing the Tcm marker CD27 and activation marker CD38 , and the checkpoint inhibitor molecule CTLA4 and activation marker 4-1BB ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1I ) . These results suggest that vaccine-elicited spike-specific CD8+ T cells , like their CD4+ counterparts , respond equivalently to the B . 1 . 1 . 7 and B . 1 . 351 variants , and exhibit qualitative differences in convalescent individuals but via different phenotypic alterations than their CD4+ counterparts . 3 Discussion As this study was aimed at using in-depth phenotyping as a discovery tool , it focused on deeply interrogating many different conditions ( e . g . spike variants , longitudinal sampling ) rather than many donors . Therefore , although a total of 165 CyTOF specimens were run , only 11 donors were analyzed . The main findings reported here should be confirmed in larger cohorts using more cost-effective and high-throughput alternatives to CyTOF such as conventional flow cytometry . Such follow-up studies should also examine the functional outcomes of the discoveries made here ( e . g . effect of chemokine receptor expression on homing of infection- and vaccine-elicited SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells ) , including in animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection . A second limitation of the study was the need to stimulate the specimens in order to identify and characterize the vaccine-elicited T cells , and our limiting our analyses of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells to those inducing IFNγ , which may have restricted our ability to characterize subsets such as Tfh cells that are relatively poor producers of this cytokine . We note however that we limited peptide exposure to 6 hours to minimize phenotypic changes caused by the stimulation , similar to our prior studies Neidleman et al . , 2021; Neidleman et al . , 2020b . Our analysis focused on CD4+ T cells because the overall numbers of detectable spike-specific CD8+ T cells were low . Nonetheless , the main findings we made with the CD4+ T cells – that they recognize variants equivalently , and that the phenotypes of the responding cells differ by prior SARS-CoV-2 natural infection status – were recapitulated among CD8+ T cells . Future studies should assess the phenotypes of non-stimulated , vaccine-elicited SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells using peptide-MHC tetramers/multimers . Such studies , however , would be limited to analyzing responses against a small number of epitopes , although use of combinatorial tetramers in conjunction with high-parameter phenotyping Newell et al . , 2013 would increase the ability to characterize a larger breadth of the vaccine-elicited T cell response . Such studies however would be limited for the most part to CD8+ T cells as tetramer reagents for CD4+ T cells are less robust . A final limitation is that serological analyses were not performed in this study . As coordination between the humoral and cellular arms of immunity are likely key to effectively controlling viral replication , future studies should assess to what extent the breadth , isotypes , and functional features of spike-specific antibodies elicited by vaccination associate with the herein described phenotypic features of vaccine-elicited SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells . 4 Materials and methods Eleven participants from the COVID-19 Host Immune Pathogenesis ( CHIRP ) cohort were recruited for this study . Six were previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 as established by RT-PCR , and had fully recovered from a mild course of disease . Importantly , infections of these six individuals had all occurred in the San Francisco Bay Area between March and July of 2020 , when the dominant local strain was the original ancestral ( Wuhan ) strain . The remaining five participants were not previously infected with the virus . All eleven participants were vaccinated with both doses of either of the Moderna or Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccines ( Table 1 ) . Blood was drawn from each of the eleven participants prior to vaccination , ~ 2 weeks after the first vaccine dose , and ~2 weeks after the second vaccine dose ( 33 specimens total ) . On the day of each blood draw , PBMCs were isolated from blood using Lymphoprep ( StemCell Technologies ) , and then cryopreserved in 90 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) and 10 % DMSO . For participant PID4101 , an additional blood-draw and intranasal swab specimens were obtained for immunophenotyping studies . This study was approved by the University of California , San Francisco , and all participants provided informed consent ( IRB # 20–30588 ) . Cryopreserved PBMCs were revived and cultured overnight to allow for antigen recovery . The cells were then counted , and then 2 million cells per treatment condition were stimulated with the co-stimulatory agents 0 . 5 μg/ml anti-CD49d clone L25 and 0 . 5 μg/ml anti-CD28 clone L293 ( both from BD Biosciences ) , in the presence of 0 . 5 μM of overlapping 15-mer SARS-CoV-2 spike peptides PepMix SARS-CoV-2 peptides from the original SARS-CoV-2 strain , B . 1 . 1 . 7 , or B . 1 . 351 , or overlapping 15-mer SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid peptides ( all from JPT Peptide Technologies ) . Stimulations were conducted for 6 hours in RP10 media ( RPMI 1640 medium ( Corning ) supplemented with 10 % FBS ( VWR ) , 1 % penicillin ( Gibco ) , and 1 % streptomycin ( Gibco ) ) , in the presence of 3 μg/ml Brefeldin A Solution ( eBioscience ) to enable detection of intracellular cytokines . To establish the phenotypes of total T cells in the absence of stimulation , 2 million cells were cultured in parallel with the stimulated samples , but in the presence of only 3 μg/ml Brefeldin A . After culture , the cells were treated with cisplatin ( Sigma-Aldrich ) as a live/dead marker and fixed with paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) as previously described Neidleman et al . , 2020b; Ma et al . , 2020 . Cisplatin treatment and fixation was performed as follows: first , cells were resuspended in 2 ml PBS ( Rockland ) with 2 ml EDTA ( Corning ) , followed by addition of 2 ml PBS/EDTA supplemented with 25 μM cisplatin ( Sigma-Aldrich ) for 60 s . Cisplatin staining was then quenched with 10 ml of CyFACS ( metal contaminant-free PBS ( Rockland ) supplemented with 0 . 1 % FBS and 0 . 1 % sodium azide ( Sigma-Aldrich ) ) , centrifuged , and resuspended in 2 % PFA in CyFACS . Fixation was allowed to proceed for 10 minutes at room temperature , after which cells were washed twice with CyFACS , and then resuspended in CyFACS containing 10 % DMSO . Fixed cells were stored at –80 °C until analysis by CyTOF . For paired blood/swab specimens from PID4101 , cells were immediately cisplatin-treated and fixed , without prior cryopreservation . CyTOF staining was conducted in a fashion similar to recently described methods Neidleman et al . , 2021; Neidleman et al . , 2020b; Ma et al . , 2020; Cavrois et al . , 2017; Neidleman et al . , 2020a; Xie et al . , 2021 . Cisplatin-treated cells were thawed , counted , and each treatment condition was barcoded using the Cell-ID 20-Plex Pd Barcoding Kit ( Fluidigm ) . After the cells were barcoded and washed , the barcoded samples were combined and diluted to 6 × 106 cells / 800 μl CyFACS per well in Nunc 96 DeepWell polystyrene plates ( Thermo Fisher ) . Cells were blocked with mouse ( Thermo Fisher ) , rat ( Thermo Fisher ) , and human AB ( Sigma-Aldrich ) sera for 15 min at 4 °C , and then washed twice in CyFACS . Surface CyTOF antibody staining ( Table 2 ) was conducted for 45 min at 4 °C , in a volume of 100 μl / sample . Cells were then washed three times with CyFACS and fixed overnight at 4 °C in 100 μl of 2 % PFA in PBS . The next day , samples were washed twice with Intracellular Fixation & Permeabilization Buffer ( eBioscience ) , and incubated for 45 minutes at 4 °C . After two additional washes with Permeabilization Buffer ( eBioscience ) , samples were blocked for 15 min at 4 °C in 100 μl of Permeabilization Buffer containing mouse and rat sera . After one additional wash with Permeabilization Buffer , samples were stained with the intracellular CyTOF antibodies ( Table 2 ) at 4 °C for 45 min in a volume of 100 μl / sample . Cells were then washed once with CyFACS , and stained for 20 min at room temperature with 250 nM of Cell-ID Intercalator-IR ( Fluidigm ) . Immediately prior to sample acquisition , cells were washed twice with CyFACS buffer , once with MaxPar cell staining buffer ( Fluidigm ) , and once with Cell acquisition solution ( CAS , Fluidigm ) . Cells were resuspended in EQ Four Element Calibration Beads ( Fluidigm ) diluted in CAS immediately prior to acquisition on a Helios-upgraded CyTOF2 instrument ( Fluidigm ) at the UCSF Parnassus flow core facility . CyTOF datasets , exported as flow cytometry standard ( FCS ) files , were de-barcoded and normalized according to manufacturer’s instructions ( Fluidigm ) . FlowJo software ( BD Biosciences ) was used to identify CD4+ T cells ( live , singlet CD3+ CD19 CD4+ CD8- ) and CD8+ T cells ( live , singlet CD3+ CD19 CD4-CD8+ ) among all analyzed samples . IFNγ+ in the stimulated samples were considered to be the SARS-CoV-2-responsive cells . For high-dimensional analyses of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells among the stimulated samples , we excluded samples with an insufficient number of events ( ≤ 3 ) to limit skewing of the data . Manual gating analysis was initially performed using FlowJo , and then select populations were exported as FCS files and then imported into R software as GatingSet objects . Using the CytoExploreR package , 2D-gates were manually drawn on the imported samples . The 2D dot plots and statistical results were exported for data visualization , bar-graph generation , and statistical comparisons as previously described ( https://github . com/DillonHammill/CytoExploreR; Hammill , 2021 ) . High-dimensional analyses ( MDS , tSNE , and FlowSOM ) were performed using R software by implementing a CyTOF workflow recently described Nowicka et al . , 2017 . For MDS plot generation , we used the plotMDS function from the limma package with default settings . Euclidean distances between all samples were calculated using the arcsinh-transformed median expression levels with cofactor 5 , of the lineage and functional markers listed below . The first ( MDS1 ) and second ( MDS2 ) MDS dimensions were plotted to show the dissimilarities between samples from the indicated conditions as described Ritchie et al . , 2015 . tSNE was performed using the Trsne function from the Rtsne package using arcsinh-transformed expression of lineage markers ( no PCA step , iterations = 1000 , , perplexity = 30 , theta = 0 . 5 ) . Events corresponding to unstimulated T cells were down-sampled to 1000 cells per sample , and SARS-CoV-2-specific cells ( cell numbers ranging from 4 to 229 per sample ) were all included in the tSNE analyses without down-sampling . Each cell was displayed in a tSNE plot for dimension reduction visualization and colored with arcsinh-transformed cell marker expression as heatmaps , or pseudo-colored by the appropriate group . Unsupervised cell subset clustering was performed using FlowSOM Van Gassen et al . , 2015 and ConsensusClusterPlus packages using arcsinh-transformed expression levels of the lineage markers indicated above Wilkerson and Hayes , 2010 . For clustering of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells , we set the meta-cluster number to eight and cluster number to 40 . The frequency of each cluster within each sample was calculated using the following equation: ( Frequency of cluster in specified sample ) = ( Cell count of cluster / Total cell count of specified sample ) . This was then converted to a percentage by multiplying by 100 . The percentages of each cluster from the selected samples were plotted as box plots with jittered points , followed by statistical analysis between the groups . To compare the abundance distribution of clusters between groups , frequencies of clusters in samples from each group were normalized using the equation below: ( Normalized frequency of cluster in specified sample ) = ( Frequency of cluster in specified sample/ Total number of samples in each group ) . This was then converted to a percentage by multiplying by 100 , and plotted as stacked bar charts . The statistical tests used in comparison of groups are indicated within the figure legends . For 2-group comparisons , student’s t-tests were performed and p-values were adjusted for multiple testing using the Holm-Sidak method where applicable . For comparisons of three or more groups , significance between groups was first evaluated by one-way ANOVA , and then the p-values were adjusted for multiple testing using the Holm-Sidak method where applicable . For datasets with significant ANOVA-adjusted p-values ( ≤ 0 . 05 ) , we performed Tukey’s honestly significant difference ( HSD ) post-hoc test to determine the p-values between individual groups . For this study , a total of 120 specimens were analyzed by CyTOF . Each specimen included both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells . For each specimen , we gated separately on events corresponding to CD4+ T cells ( live , singlet CD3+ CD19- CD4+ CD8- ) and CD8+ T cells ( live , singlet CD3+ CD19- CD4 CD8+ ) , and exported the files as 240 individual FCS files . These 240 raw CyTOF datasets are available for download through the public repository Dryad via the following link: https://doi . org/10 . 7272/Q60R9MMK ."}

It is generally possible to cure cancers that remain contained within a small area . However , if the tumor cells start to move , the cancer may spread in the body and become life threatening . Currently , most of the anti-cancer treatments act to reduce the multiplication of these cells , but not their ability to migrate . A signal protein called Ras stimulates human cells to grow and move around . In healthy cells , the activity of Ras is tightly controled to ensure cells only divide and migrate at particular times , but in roughly 30% of all human cancers , Ras is abnormally active . Ras switches on another protein , named RalB , which is also involved in inappropriate cell migration . Yet , it is not clear how RalB is capable to help Ras trigger the migration of cells . Zago et al . used an approach called optogenetics to specifically activate the RalB protein in human cells using a laser that produces blue light . When activated , the light-controlled RalB started abnormal cell migration; this was used to dissect which molecules and mechanisms were involved in the process . Taken together , the experiments showed that , first , Ras ‘turns on’ RalB by changing the location of two proteins that control RalB . Then , the activated RalB regulates the exocyst , a group of proteins that travel within the cell . In turn , the exocyst recruits another group of proteins , named the Wave complex , which is part of the molecular motor required for cells to migrate . Zago et al . also found that , in patients , the RalB protein was present at abnormally high levels in samples of breast cancer cells that had migrated to another part of the body . Overall , these findings indicate that the role of RalB protein in human cancers is larger than previously thought , and they highlight a new pathway that could be a target for new anti-cancer drugs .", "article": "1 Introduction One of the most frequent oncogenic events in human cancers is the activation by constitutive mutations of Ras GTPases: K-Ras , H-Ras , N-Ras . Roughly 30% of all human tumors carry Ras genetic alterations; the Ras mutation frequency is particularly high for pancreas ( 91% ) , lung ( 33% ) and colon ( 51% ) cancers ( cbioportal ) ( Gao et al . , 2013; Simanshu et al . , 2017 ) . Up-to-date no effective targeted therapies can be offered to patients with tumors carrying Ras mutations . Since Ras proteins are still considered undruggable ( Cox et al . , 2014 ) , the focus for anti-Ras drug discovery moved downstream . Ras activates three major downstream pathways: the MAP kinases , the PI3 kinases and the Ral GTPases . Despite the considerable translational research efforts on the downstream kinases , the results are very deceiving . For example , MAPK pathway inhibition with MEK inhibitor therapy turned out to be largely ineffective ( Jänne et al . , 2013 ) . On the other hand , the targeting of Ral GTPases has been a much less exploited strategy ( Yan et al . , 2014; Yan and Theodorescu , 2018 ) . The two human Ral proteins ( RalA and RalB ) are activated by six RalGEFs ( Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors ) ( Neel et al . , 2011 ) . Among the six , four RalGEFs ( RalGDS , Rgl1 , Rgl2 , Rgl3 ) have a Ras-association ( RA ) domain and are direct effectors of Ras . Activated GTP-bound Ras recruits these RalGEFs at the plasma-membrane triggering the activation of Ral by GDP to GTP exchange . The two remaining RALGEFs ( RalGPS1 and RalGPS2 ) do not bind Ras; their specific activators are still unknown , but they do contain a pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domain ( Rebhun et al . , 2000 ) , responsible for membrane targeting , and a proline-rich motif which binds to SH3-containing signaling proteins ( Ceriani et al . , 2007 ) . Even though , in some cellular contexts , RalA and RalB seem to have overlapping effects , several evidences pointed out a distinct role for RalB in supporting the invasiveness of transformed cells . In the case of migration of the UMUC3 human bladder cancer cell line ( K-Ras mutated ) , RalA seems to even antagonize the pro-migratory function of RalB ( Oxford et al . , 2005 ) . The requirement of RalB for invasion in vitro ( by Transwell Invasion assay ) was shown by shRNA knock-down approach in seven out of nine K-Ras mutated human pancreatic cancer cell lines ( Lim et al . , 2006 ) . Consistently , another study showed that RalB , but not RalA , plays a role in invadopodia formation in human pancreatic cancer cell lines ( Neel et al . , 2012 ) . RalB , but not RalA , is required for the contractility-driven invasion of lung cancer cells ( A549 , K-Ras mutated ) ( Biondini et al . , 2015 ) . Moreover , in vivo metastasis assays in mice ( tail vein injection ) ( Ward et al . , 2001; Lim et al . , 2006 ) and in hamsters ( subcutaneous injection ) ( Rybko et al . , 2011 ) supported a function of RalB pathway in the formation of tumor metastasis , both in Ras-mutated and Rous sarcoma virus-transformed cells . Besides the cancer context , we previously found that RalB , but not RalA , controls the mesenchymal migration of normal cells ( NRK , HEK-HT , wild-type for Ras ) by mobilizing its effector exocyst ( Rossé et al . , 2006; Parrini et al . , 2011; Biondini et al . , 2016 ) , which is an octameric protein complex involved in the tethering of secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane prior to SNARE-mediated fusion ( Wu and Guo , 2015 ) . All these works allowed to recognize the relevance of RalB pathway for motility , invasion and metastasis , but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive ( Neel et al . , 2012 ) . We reasoned that the emerging optogenetics technology ( Toettcher et al . , 2013; Tischer and Weiner , 2014 ) might help to overcome this limitation , because of its capacity to dissect the cause-effect relationships linking the activity of a specific protein of interest and the consequent cell behaviors , in time and space . To date , various light-gated protein-interaction modules have been introduced to perturb intracellular protein activities . The one we exploited is based on the interaction between two proteins from Arabidopsis Thaliana: CIB1 and cryptochrome 2 ( CRY2 ) ( Kennedy et al . , 2010 ) . Blue-light illumination induces the heterodimerization of CRY2 with the N-terminus of CIB1 ( CIBN ) . This reaction is reversible and rapid , with response times in the order of seconds ( few seconds for dimerization and ~5 min for dissociation after cessation of blue illumination ) , and does not require exogenous cofactors . In this work , we applied the CRY2-CIBN light dimerization system to selectively activate Ral cascade and to study the primordial phenotypic effect of this activation . By using this novel optogenetics approach , we precisely established the molecular mechanism underlying the capacity of RalB to drive invasion . This mechanism involves the exocyst-dependent recruitment at the leading edge of the Wave Regulatory Complex ( WRC ) , a five-subunit protein complex involved in the formation of the actin cytoskeleton through interaction with the Arp2/3 complex ( Alekhina et al . , 2017; Chen et al . , 2014 ) , but unexpectedly independently of the small GTPase Rac1 , a well-established WRC activator and master regulator of protrusions ( Ridley et al . , 1992; Ridley , 2006 ) . We also found that RalB pathway contribution might be much more relevant than MAPK and PI3K contributions to drive Ras-dependent invasion , as ascertained by using a genetically controlled cell model: the isogenic pair HEK-HT and HEK-HT-H-RasV12 ( Hahn et al . , 1999; O'Hayer and Counter , 2006 ) . Light-induced Ral activation was instructive in promoting cell invasion of the non-transformed HEK-HT cells . Finally , we analyzed Ral proteins’ expression in a cohort of breast cancer samples , pointing out for the first time a potential role of RalB in the invasiveness and metastatic spread of human breast cancers . 2 Results We exploited the CRY2/CIBN light-gated dimerization system ( Kennedy et al . , 2010 ) to induce activation of endogenous RalA and RalB proteins with a spatial and temporal control . We chose to activate Ral at the plasma-membrane because Ral oncogenic signaling emanates at least in part from the plasma-membrane ( Ward et al . , 2001; Hamad et al . , 2002; Lim et al . , 2005 ) . To do so , the GFP-fused CIBN protein was constitutively targeted to the plasma membrane via a K-Ras CAAX motif . The minimal GEF domain of RGL2 ( 1–518 aa ) , which is catalytically active on both RalA and RalB ( Ferro et al . , 2008 ) , was fused to CRY2-mCherry ( RalGEF-CRY2-mCherry ) . We stably expressed these two constructs in HEK-HT cells , which are immortalized but not transformed ( Hahn et al . , 1999; O'Hayer and Counter , 2006 ) , to generate the ‘OptoRal’ cell line ( CIBN-CAAX/RalGEF-CRY2 ) . As control , we generated the ‘OptoControl’ cell line which expresses CRY2-mCherry only , without the RalGEF domain ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . Upon blue light illumination ( 100 ms pulses every 15 s ) , RalGEF-CRY2-mCherry reversibly translocated to the plasma membrane following its binding to GFP-CIBN-CAAX ( Figure 1A ) , as shown by TIRF microscopy ( Figure 1B and Video 1 ) . Fluorescence quantifications inside the illuminated area showed that RalGEF-CRY2 recruitment starts in less than 15 s , as expected ( Valon et al . , 2015 ) , reaching a threefold increase in few minutes ( Figure 1C ) . In order to assess whether the recruitment of RalGEF-CRY2 was converted in an efficient Ral activation , we used a Ral activity reporter: the iRFP-tagged Ral GTPase Binding Domain of Sec5 ( Sec5GBD ) , which specifically interacts with both RalA and RalB in their GTP loaded forms ( Takaya et al . , 2004 ) . Since the Sec5GBD-iRFP reporter proteins were in large excess with respect to the endogenous Ral proteins , we overexpressed GFP-RalB in OptoRal cells in order to increase the RalB:Sec5GBD stoichiometric ratio and to achieve the recruitment of a major , detectable fraction of Sec5GBD molecules . Upon blue light illumination , Sec5GBD-iRFP fluorescence at plasma membrane increased 1 . 4 fold ( Figure 1D , E and Video 2 ) , indicating an efficient activation of Ral proteins , presumably a combination of exogenous GFP-RalB , and endogenous RalA and RalB . The light-induced RalB activation was confirmed by pull-down assay ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1A ) and by a FRET-based RalB activity biosensor ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1B ) . The activation was selective for Ral without cross activation of Rac1 or Cdc42 , as shown by over-expressing GFP-Rac1 or GFP-Cdc42 together with a Rac1/Cdc42 activity reporter: the iRFP-tagged GTPase Binding Domain of Pak1 ( Pak1GBD ) ( Valon et al . , 2015 ) , which specifically interacts with Rac1-GTP and Cdc42-GTP ( Sells et al . , 1997; Huang et al . , 2013 ) . Upon blue light illumination , Pak1GBD-iRFP fluorescence at plasma membrane did not increase , on the contrary slightly decreased ( Figure 1E ) , indicating the absence of Rac1 or Cdc42 activation upon recruitment of RalGEF at the plasma membrane . In conclusion , we developed an efficient and selective optogenetic OptoRal system to specifically trigger local activation of Ral proteins . Since the optogenetic perturbations act in a timescale ( tens of second ) much faster than the ones of endogenous feedbacks ( minutes ) ( Valon et al . , 2015 ) , this new approach allowed us to investigate the direct consequences of Ral activation , at both phenotypic and molecular levels . A conspicuous phenotypic consequence of local Ral activation was an increase in cell edge dynamics , leading to protrusion formation ( Video 3 ) . By using an automated method ( Paul-Gilloteaux et al . , 2018 ) , we tracked over time the cell contour inside the illuminated area and we generated edge velocity maps ( Figure 2A ) . The velocity maps of OptoRal cells showed an evident stimulation of cell edge dynamics after light stimulation ( Figure 2B ) . This stimulation corresponded , for the majority of the sampled space and time points , to an increase of positive velocity ( i . e . protrusions ) and not of negative velocities ( i . e . retractions ) . In contrast , no changes of cell edge dynamics were observed upon light stimulation of OptoControl cells ( Figure 2C and Video 4 ) , excluding non-specific effects due to illumination or to CRY2 recruitment . Moreover , the alternations of dark and light periods revealed that the velocity dynamics were reversible and exquisitely controllable by the illumination in OptoRal cells ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2A ) but not in the OptoControl cells ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2B ) . The quantifications of edge velocities from several OptoRal cells before and after illumination showed a highly significant increase of membrane protrusion events , but not of retraction events; this increase was not found in OptoControl cells ( Figure 2D ) . To address a possible role of Rac in this phenotype we treated the OptoRal cells with the RacGEF inhibitor NSC23766 . Treatment with NSC23766 ( 100 µM , 1 hr ) substantially reduced ( ~60% ) Rac1-GTP level ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2C ) , but it did not impair a fully efficient protrusion induction by illumination in OptoRal cells ( Figure 2D ) , suggesting that Rac1 have a marginal role in stimulation of edge velocities when Ral proteins are activated . Importantly , blue illumination of OptoRal cells does not activate at all Rac1 , as shown by the Pak1GBD fluorescent reporter ( Figure 1E ) . These results together support the conclusion that Ral triggers protrusion independently of Rac1 . Our OptoRal system is designed to activate both endogenous RalA and RalB . However , RalB-depleted cells , but not RalA depleted cells , were impaired in protrusions formation , proving that light-controlled stimulation of cell protrusions is essentially due to activation of endogenous RalB , rather than RalA ( Figure 2E and Figure 2—figure supplement 2D for depletion validation ) , consistently with the well-established specific role of RalB in the regulation of motility and invasion ( see Introduction ) . Next , we addressed the question of the molecular mechanisms underlying the capacity of RalB to trigger protrusions independently of Rac1 . A previous work in our lab ( Biondini et al . , 2016 ) established the existence of an interaction between the Wave Regulatory Complex ( WRC ) , a crucial regulator of actin polymerization and protrusion formations ( Alekhina et al . , 2017; Chen et al . , 2014 ) , and the exocyst complex ( Wu and Guo , 2015 ) , a major direct effector of Ral , but the functional consequences of this interaction are still unclear . We reasoned that Ral activation might promote the trafficking and recruitment of the exocyst/WRC complex assembly at the leading edge ( Figure 3A ) . To test this hypothesis , we generated OptoRal and OptoControl cell lines stably expressing the iRFP-fused Abi1 subunit of WRC complex . The correct incorporation of iRFP-Abi1 into the WRC complex was verified by size exclusion chromatography: the exogenous iRFP-Abi1 , as well as the endogenous Abi1 , co-eluted with the Cyfip subunit in fractions of approximately 400 kDa corresponding to the size of the whole WRC complex ( Gautreau et al . , 2004 ) ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1A , B ) . We locally activated Ral at cell periphery and followed iRFP-Abi1 recruitment . For convenience of imaging , we limited the inter-cellular morphology variability by subjecting the OptoRal cells to wound healing , leading to the formation of large front lamellipodia where Ral was activated by light . TIRF images showed that Ral activation induced an immediate increase of iRFP-Abi1 signal at the plasma membrane , both at the leading edge and at the ventral side ( Figure 3B snapshots and Video 5 ) . In contrast , OptoControl cells did not show any light-dependent iRFP-Abi1 recruitment ( Figure 3C snapshots and Video 6 ) . WRC edge recruitment was quantified by using an automated method that measures the maximum fluorescent intensity at the edge ( width of 1 . 12 µm ) ( Paul-Gilloteaux et al . , 2018 ) : the resulting heat maps show a dynamic edge fluorescence appearing upon illumination in OptoRal cells ( Figure 3D , left ) but not in OptoControl cells ( Figure 3D , right ) . We could not apply this method of quantification at the edge on all the imaged cells , because the leading edge was often lifted above the ventral plan captured by TIRF and because the cycling dynamics ( protrusion-retraction alternation and on-off Abi1 recruitment ) were very fast . Instead , fluorescence quantifications from several OptoRal and OptoControl cells could be easily done at ventral location inside the illuminated area: iRFP-Abi1 was recruited in OptoRal cells but not in OptoControl cells , with a robust statistical significance ( Figure 3E ) . To demonstrate that WRC translocation is a direct consequence of its association with the exocyst , we exploited a previously characterized loss-of-interaction Abi1 mutant , Abi1Q56A , which is specifically impaired in its binding to the Exo70 subunit of exocyst ( Biondini et al . , 2016 ) . We generated an OptoRal cell line expressing the iRFP-Abi1Q56A mutant and we verified its correct incorporation into WRC by size exclusion chromatography ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1C ) . The analysis of several cells showed that upon Ral activation the recruitment at the ventral plasma membrane of the AbiQ56A mutant was significantly and substantially reduced with respect to wild-type Abi1 ( Figure 3E ) , indicating that the WRC/exocyst association is required for efficient translocation of WRC complex . Moreover , while illumination stimulated edge velocity of OptoRal cells expressing Abi1 wild-type , it was not effective in stimulating edge velocity of OptoRal cells expressing the Abi1Q56A mutant ( Figure 3F ) , indicating that reduction of WRC recruitment correlated with a decrease in protrusion dynamics . In order to functionally assess the impact on invasion of light-controlled Ral activation , we performed a Transwell invasion assay coupled with optogenetic illumination . For this purpose , we designed and built a customized 12-well array LED to deliver optical stimuli to the cells inside the Transwells ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) . Blue light was administrated continuously from the bottom of the Transwell plate for the whole duration of the invasion assay ( 6 hr ) . Using this device , we compared the invasive capabilities of OptoControl and OptoRal cells , as well of OptoControl iRFP-Abi1 wild-type , OptoRal iRFP-Abi1 wild-type , and OptoRal iRFP-Abi1Q56A , in both dark and light stimulation conditions . Illumination of OptoRal cells , but not of OptoControl cells , was sufficient to induce a substantial increase of invasive capabilities ( Figure 4A ) . Similar results were obtained upon expression of the wild-type Abi1 subunit of WRC complex , whereas OptoRal cells expressing Abi1Q56A ( the allele specifically impaired in its binding to exocyst [Biondini et al . , 2016] ) failed to invade upon light stimulation ( Figure 4B ) . These results strongly support the conclusion that activation of Ral drives cell invasion by recruiting WRC via the exocyst . To evaluate the contribution of Ral activation downstream oncogenic Ras in cell invasion , we took advantage of the fact that HEK-HT cells , non-transformed , develop a tumorigenic , invasive and metastatic phenotype in vivo upon expression of oncogenic H-RasV12 ( Hahn et al . , 1999; O'Hayer and Counter , 2006 ) . We compared this isogenic pair , HEK-HT and HEK-HTRasV12 , by using two different in vitro invasion assays: the widely used ‘Transwell Invasion assay’ ( invasion through a thin matrigel layer ) and the ‘Inverted Invasion assay’ with a more 3D setting ( invasion through a thick collagen gel ) . In both assays , we found as expected that HEK-HT cells did not invade at all , while HEK-HT-RasV12 displayed a strong invasive capacity ( Figure 5A , B ) . Interestingly , the HEK-HT-RasV12 cells invaded as multi-cellular clusters in the 3D collagen gel ( Figure 5B , photos below ) . In HEK-HTRasV12 cells , the silencing of RalB impaired Transwell invasion of approximatively 60% , the silencing of RalA had not effect , and the silencing of both RalB and RalA reached up to 90% invasion inhibition ( Figure 5C ) ( see Figure 5—figure supplement 1A for depletion efficiencies ) , indicating that Ras-dependent RalB activation substantially contributes to the invasive phenotype of Ras-mutated cells , and that RalA is dispensable , but it might partially compensate when RalB is absent . The specific role of RalB , with respect to RalA , for cell motility and invasion is in perfect agreement with several previous works ( Oxford et al . , 2005; Rossé et al . , 2006; Lim et al . , 2006; Rybko et al . , 2011 ) . The RalB requirement for in vitro invasion of HEK-HTRasV12 cells was confirmed using the Inverted Invasion assay with collagen ( Figure 5D ) ( see Figure 5—figure supplement 1B for depletion efficiency up to 5 days post-siRNA transfection ) . The double mutant H-RasV12G37 , which is completely impaired in stimulating MAP kinase activity but maintains Ral activation ( White et al . , 1995; Bettoun et al . , 2016 ) ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1C ) , showed the same invasive capabilities by Transwell invasion assay as compared with H-RasV12 ( Figure 5E , center ) , indicating that Ras-dependent MAPK hyper-activation is dispensable to drive efficient invasion , in this genetically controlled cell model . Since HEK-HT-RasV12G37 cells retained a residual Ras-dependent activation of PI3K pathway activation , as assessed by AKT phosphorylation ( Lim et al . , 2005; Bettoun et al . , 2016 ) , we used a PI3K inhibitor ( PIK90 ) , which targets all PI3K isoforms , to completely inhibit PI3K pathway ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1D ) . PIK90-treated HEK-HT-RasV12G37 cells are still capable to invade as efficiently as untreated HEK-HT-RasV12G37 and HEK-HT-RasV12 cells ( Figure 5E , right ) , indicating that also Ras-dependent PI3K hyper-activation is dispensable to drive efficient Transwell invasion . These unexpected results were confirmed with HEK-HT-RasV12 cells by a purely pharmacological approach using the MEK inhibitor trametinib and the PI3K inhibitor PIK90 , alone or in combination . Despite a nearly complete inhibition of Erk or Akt phosphorylation , trametinib-treated or PIK90-treated HEK-HT-RasV12 cells were still able to invade to the same extent as control vehicle-treated cells; only the combined MAPK and PI3K blockage displayed an inhibitory tendency , although not statistically significant ( Figure 5F ) . Taken together these results showed that the Ras-RalGEF-RalB signaling axis is necessary to promote invasion in Ras-transformed cells , while MAPK and PI3K pathways appear to be dispensable , at least in our experimental context . Next , we aimed at identifying the missing molecular link between Ras and RalB , that is the specific RalGEFs implicated in Ras-dependent cell invasion . We thus silenced each of the six RalGEFs by two independent siRNA in HEK-HT-RasV12 cells . The depletion of RGL1 and RGL2 substantially reduced invasion . RLGL3 , RalGDS and RalGPS1 were clearly not required for invasion , while RalGPS2 silencing showed a potential inhibitory effect , even though statistically not significant ( Figure 6A ) . RGL1 and RGL2 have a Ras-association domain ( RA ) . We therefore concluded that RGL1 and RGL2 are the molecular actors that promote invasion down-stream oncogenic Ras by activating RalB . By immunofluorescence staining , we found that endogenous RGL2 ( Figure 6B ) and RalB ( Figure 6C ) were more recruited at cell edges in HEK-HTRasV12 cells with respect to normal HEK-HT cells , consistent with the model in which plasma-membrane Ras-GTP binds and recruits RGL2 , which in turn binds and activates its substrate RalB , promoting invasiveness via exocyst-mediated WRC recruitment ( Figure 6D ) . Noteworthy , both RGL2 and RalB localize also at endomembranes , where local signaling might drive additional outputs . While Ral proteins have been involved in several cancers frequently carrying Ras mutations , such as pancreas , lung , colon , bladder , melanoma ( Yan and Theodorescu , 2018 ) , their roles have not been explored in breast cancers , in which the Ras mutation frequency is rather low ( 2 . 3% ) ( cbioportal ) ( Gao et al . , 2013 ) . We investigated by immunohistocytochemistry ( IHC ) the protein levels of RalA and RalB in 502 invasive ductal carcinoma representative of the four main molecular subtypes ( luminal A , luminal B , HER2+ , triple-negative ) ( see Figure 7—figure supplement 1A for intensity scores ) . In invasive ductal carcinoma , RalB protein expression was slightly higher in luminal A and B than in HER2 +and triple-negative ( TN ) tumors ( Figure 7—figure supplement 1B ) , while RalA protein expression was slightly lower in TN tumors as compared to the other subtypes ( Figure 7—figure supplement 1C ) . More interestingly , both RalB and RalA expression was higher in tumor cells than in normal juxtatumoral cells ( Figure 7A , B ) . We also relatively compared the Ral staining at in situ and invasive compartments of invasive ductal carcinoma , and at lymph node metastasis . Strikingly , RalB expression significantly increased in a manner consistent with disease progression: the median H-score was = 0 . 5 in normal juxtatumoral cells , =1 in tumor cells of in situ compartment , =1 . 5 in tumor cells of invasive compartment , and = 2 in tumor cells at lymph node metastasis ( Figure 7A , C ) . On the contrary , RalA expression did not change in tumor cells regardless of the in situ , invasive or metastatic localization ( Figure 7B ) . With the limitation that RalB amount does not necessarily reflect RalB activity , these results suggest that RalB might have a role in human breast cancer invasion and metastasis . Consistent with this hypothesis , RalB silencing was able to impair invasion ( by Transwell invasion assay ) of two triple-negative breast cancer cell lines: MDA-MB-231 ( carrying the KRasG13D mutation ) and BT549 ( Ras wild-type ) ( Figure 7D and Figure 7—figure supplement 1D ) . 3 Discussion Collectively our findings established the utter relevance of the activation of RalB to promote invasion . By exploiting optogenetics to study causality , we showed that not only RalB was permissive for protrusion formation and invasion , but it was instructive in absence of any oncogenic mutation . Moreover , we provide a detailed molecular model of how the Ras-RalB signaling axis governs cell invasion ( Figure 6D ) : active Ras binds and recruits the two RalGEFs RGL1 and RGL2 , which activate RalB; activated RalB binds to the exocyst complex , promoting its assembly ( Moskalenko et al . , 2003 ) and recruitment to the leading edge ( Rossé et al . , 2006 ) ; by its direct association with the WRC complex ( Biondini et al . , 2016 ) , exocyst drives WRC to the leading edge , where WRC stimulates actin polymerization , protrusion formation , motility and invasion . Unexpectedly , using the model of isogenic cell lines HEK-HT and HEK-HT-H-RasV12 , we found that hyper-activations of MAP kinase and PI3 kinase pathways were not required for Ras-driven invasion . A huge previous literature had undoubtedly shown that MAPK and PI3K are involved in migration and invasion of various normal and cancer cell models ( Keely et al . , 1997; Klemke et al . , 1997; Ward et al . , 2001; Janda et al . , 2002; Campbell et al . , 2007 ) . However we speculate that this could not be the case in specific , relevant cellular contexts , such as the HEK-HT-H-RasV12 cells in which the RalB pathway appears to be the dominant driver of invasion down-stream oncogenic Ras . In support of this hypothesis , in a panel of pancreatic cell lines , Ral pathway was found to be more commonly activated as compared to MAPK and PI3K , since abnormally high Ral-GTP levels were much more frequent than abnormally high levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 or phosphorylated AKT ( Lim et al . , 2005 ) . In human cancer contexts , the contribution of Ral pathway activation is likely still under-estimated . Even though genetic alterations in Ral genes are rare events in human cancers , occurring in only 1 . 5% to 2% of patient cases considering a variety of cancer types , alterations in genes coding for Ral regulators in human tumors are not uncommon . Notably , RGL1 and RalGPS1 are found amplified in 11% of breast cancer patients , meanwhile RalGAPA1 , RalGAPA2 and RalGAPB are altered in 14% , 8% and 6% of lung cancer patients , respectively ( cbioportal bioinformatics platform ) ( Gao et al . , 2013 ) , consistent with the notion that dysregulation of Ral might be important for oncogenesis or tumor progression . In almost all cancer types examined ( pancreas , colon , lung , bladder , prostate , melanoma ) , increased overexpression and/or activation of both RalA and RalB have been observed in patient tumor samples compared with normal tissues , regardless of their Ras mutation status ( Yan and Theodorescu , 2018 ) . Moreover , Ral-GTP level were found elevated in various tumor-derived cell lines harboring different Ras status , including pancreas ( Lim et al . , 2005 ) , colon ( Martin et al . , 2011 ) , bladder ( Saito et al . , 2013 ) , liver ( Ezzeldin et al . , 2014 ) , lung ( Male et al . , 2012 ) and brain ( Ginn et al . , 2016 ) . The only exception so far is squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) , where RalA was found to suppress rather than promote tumor progression ( Sowalsky et al . , 2010 ) . In this work we examined Ral protein expression in patient breast tumor samples and we found overexpression of both RalA and RalB as compared to normal breast tissues , therefore adding breast cancers to the list of human cancers with potential overstimulation of Ral pathway . Very interestingly , RalB ( but not RalA ) protein expression increased in a manner consistent with disease progression ( normal < in situ < invasive < metastatic tissues ) , supporting once more a crucial role for RalB in cancer invasion and metastasis . In conclusion , we propose that the pharmacological inhibition of the here established Ras-RGL1/2-RalB-exocyst-WRC pathway holds promises as anticancer strategy and definitely warrants further investigations . 4 Materials and methods Cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium ( DMEM ) supplemented with 2 mM glutamine , penicillin , streptomycin , 10% fetal bovine serum . All cell lines were systematically tested to exclude mycoplasma contamination using a qPCR-based method ( VenorGem Classic , BioValley ) and authenticated by SRT profiling ( GenePrint 10 system , Promega ) . See Supplementary file 1 for detailed information and selection antibiotics . Transient DNA transfections were performed with Lipofectamine Plus reagents ( Invitrogen ) or JetPRIME ( Polyplus ) . Transient double siRNA and DNA transfections were performed with RNAiMAX ( Invitrogen ) and JetPEI ( Polyplus ) . See Supplementary file 2 and Supplementary file 3 for plasmid and siRNA sequences used in this work . All cells lines stably expressing the optogenetic dimerizing system were generated from HEK-HT cell lines via infection using lentiviruses . For viral production , 293 T cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) with pHR-CRY2 or pLVX viral vectors along with lentiviral packaging plasmid ( psPAX2 ) and VSVG expression vector ( pCMV-VSV-G ) . Viral supernatant was harvested at 72 hr post-transfection , filtered , and added to the recipient cell lines for 24 hr with 6 μg/ml polybrene ( # 107689 , Sigma-Aldrich ) . Cells were sorted for co-expression of the fluorescent constructs by cell sorting on a BD FacsAria II ( BD Bioscience , Flow Cytometry Core Facility Institut Curie ) , and cell populations were used in bulk . For imaging cells were plated on 25 mm glass coverslips , pre-coated with 120 µg/mL of collagen type I of rat-tail ( Institut de Biotechnologie Jacques Boy ) , and placed in an observation chamber ( Pecon , Meyer Instruments ) . Imaging was performed at 37°C and 5% CO2 in a heating chamber ( Pecon , Meyer Instruments ) on an inverted microscope Olympus IX71 equipped with a 100X objective with NA 1 . 45 . The microscope was controlled with the software Metamorph ( Molecular Devices ) . Differential interference contrast ( DIC ) imaging was performed with a far-red filter ( cutoff 550 nm , BLP01-635R-25 , Semrock ) in the illumination path to avoid CRY2 activation . Total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) images were acquired using an azimuthal TIRF module ( ilas2 , Roper Scientific ) . Localized stimulation was performed with the FRAP system at low laser power ( ~5% ) with both 491 nm and 401 nm wavelength light lasers ( Stradus ) , 2–3 100 ms pulses , every 10–15 s . Imaging of Cherry and iRFP was done with 561 nm and 642 nm laser ( Stradus ) , respectively . For image processing and data analysis , after background subtraction , the mean fluorescence over the time inside the blue light activated region ( ROI ) was measured using Metamorph software . The mCherry and iRFP recruitment curves obtained from TIRF images were expressed as fold increase of fluorescence: the value of fluorescence for each time point was normalized by the pre-illumination fluorescence ( mean of the first frames without light activation ) . For cell edge morphodynamics and recruitment analysis , a custom-built ImageJ plugin , named ‘Recruitment Edge Dynamics’ , was used ( Paul-Gilloteaux et al . , 2018 ) . The Transwell insert consisted in a porous membrane ( 8 µm pore size ) with on top a thin layer of matrigel matrix that mimics the extracellular matrix ( #354483 , BD Biosciences ) . Prior to seeding in the Transwell chambers , cells were starved overnight in DMEM with 0 . 2% serum . 100 , 000 cells per well were seeded on the top of the insert in 0 . 2% serum medium , while 10% serum medium was placed in the well below , to create a chemoattractant gradient . After 6 hr of incubation at 37°C and 5% CO2 , the insert was washed with PBS , non-invasive cells on the top of the insert were removed with a cotton swab . The cells that did invade on the bottom were fixed with 4% PFA , permeabilized with 0 . 5% NP-40 and incubated with 5 mg/ml DAPI to stain the nuclei . The porous membranes were cut out and mounted on slides using ProLong Gold antifade reagent ( Invitrogen ) . Cell nuclei were imaged using an epifluorescence a Zeiss Axioplan microscope ( 10X objective ) , images were acquired with a Coolsnap HQ2 camera ( Roper Scientific ) and counted using ImageJ plugin ‘Cell Counter’ . The Invasion index is calculated from the mean of all the replicates per each condition , normalized on the mean of the control per each experiment . For Transwell coupled with optogenetic , each well was illuminated with an independent LED using a custom-made illumination device consisting of an array of 5 mm blue LEDs ( 480 nm , 12 cd , 30° ) driven by an Arduino Due micro-controller and delivering 3 . 5 mW each . Blue light was administered continuously from the bottom of the Transwell plate for the whole duration of the experiment ( 6 hr ) . Inverse invasion assays were performed accordingly to a previously published protocol ( Kajiho et al . , 2016 ) , but using a collagen gel instead of Matrigel . An ice-cold gel preparation of bovine collagen type I ( #5005-B , Advanced Biomatrix ) at a final concentration of 2 . 3 mg/mL , in MEM medium containing 0 . 28% NaHCO3 ( pH = 8 ) , was incubated 2 . 5 hr at 4°C ( nucleation step ) , pipetted into 12-well 8-μm-pore-diameter transwells ( #353182 , Corning ) ( 230 μm gel preparation per insert ) , inserted into a 12-well tissue culture plate , and incubated at 37°C for 1 hr ( polymerization step ) . The transwells were then inverted , 4 × 104 cells were seeded on the underside of the porous membrane , and placed in 6-well plate for 2 hr ( cell attachment step ) . The transwells were inverted back , washed 3 times with 1 ml of serum-free medium , and placed in 1 . 5 ml of serum-free medium inside a 12-well plate ( lower chamber ) ; 230 µl of 10% FBS-DMEM supplemented with 25 ng/ml EGF were added inside the transwell ( upper chamber ) . The cells were then allowed to invade upward into the bovine collagen and toward the gradient of serum/EGF for 4 days at 37°C and 5% CO2 . Cells were live stained with CellTrace yellow ( Thermofisher ) for 1 hr at 37°C and rapidly imaged by confocal microscopy ( Zeiss LSM880 , 10x objective , excitation at 545 nm and emission at 605 nm ) . Optical sections were captured at 5 µm intervals , starting from the underside of the transwell membrane and moving upward in the direction of cell invasion . The resulting fluorescence images were quantified using ImageJ software . For each independent experiment , data were generated from two duplicate transwells , and optical sections were acquired from two areas of each transwell . For immunoblotting , cells were lysed in RIPA buffer ( 150 mM NaCl , 2 mM MgCl , 2 mM CaCl2 , 0 . 5% NaDOC , 1% NP40 , 0 . 1% SDS , 10% Glycerol , 50 mM Tris-HCL pH 8 . 0 ) containing 2 mM Na3VO4 , 10 mM NaF , 1 mM DTT and a protease inhibitor mixture ( #0589291001 , Roche ) . Equal amounts of protein were diluted in 4x Laemmli buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE . Proteins were transferred to 0 . 45 μm nitrocellulose membranes ( Whatman ) by wet transfer and blocked with 3% BSA in TBS/0 . 05% Tween-20 for 30 min . Primary antibodies were: mouse anti-RalA ( #610222 , BD Transduction Laboratories , dilution 1:1000 ) ; rabbit anti-RalB ( #3523 , Cell Signaling , dilution 1:500 ) ; mouse anti AKT ( pan ) ( #2920 , Cell Signaling , dilution 1:1000 ) ; rabbit anti p-AKT ( Ser437 ) ( #9271 , Cell Signaling , dilution 1:1000 ) . Protein levels were detected using LICOR Odyssey Infrared Imaging System ( LI-COR Biosciences ) upon incubation with IRDye secondary antibodies for 1 hr at room temperature . For immunofluorescence , cells were cultured on coverslips , fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde , quenched with 1M Glycine solution , permeabilized with 0 . 1% of Triton-100X , incubated with 4% FBS +1% BSA blocking solution , then with primary and secondary antibodies , every step being in PBS buffer . Primary antibodies were: mouse anti-RalB ( #WH0005899M4 , clone 4D1 , Sigma-Aldrich , dilution 1:200 ) , mouse anti-RGL2 ( #H00005863-M02 , clone 4D10 , Novus biologicals , dilution 1:200 ) . For RT-qPCR analysis , total RNA was extracted using RNaeasy Plus Mini kit ( Quigen ) . Retrotranscription and amplification were obtained using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit ( BioRad ) , the SYBR Green Master Mix kit or TaqMan ( Applied Biosystems ) on the ABI Prism7900 SequenceDetection System ( Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems ) . See Supplementary file 4 for the RT-qPCR primers . Rac1 activity was measured using the ‘Rac1 Pull-down Activation Assay Biochem Kit’ ( # BK035 , Cytoskeleton ) , which is based on beads-coupled GST-Pak1GBD . A similar pull-down assay was used for RalB activity but using home-made beads-coupled GST-Sec5GBD . For RalB activity measurement by FRET , cells were transfected with a validated FRET-based RalB biosensor ( Martin et al . , 2014 ) and imaged with an Olympus IX71 microscope equipped with a FRET filter set ( 86002v1JP4 , Chroma Technology ) and a 63x oil-immersion objective . YFP/CFP images were generated using Metamorph and ImageJ software . Cells were washed in ice‐cold PBS and lysed in 30 mM Tris ( pH 7 . 2 ) , 150 mM NaCl and 1% CHAPS . Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 40 000 r . p . m . for 30 min . Protein was fractionated on a Superose 6 10/300 GL Increase ( GE Healthcare Life Sciences ) connected to an ÄKTA pure chromatography system ( GE Healthcare Life Sciences , Protein Expression and Purification Core Facility , Institut Curie ) . The column was eluted with 30 mM Tris ( pH 7 . 2 ) , 150 mM NaCl and 1% CHAPS at 0 . 5 ml/min and 0 . 5 ml fractions were collected . Prior to SDS-PAGE analysis , proteins were concentrated with 20% Trichloroacetic Acid Protein ( TCA ) , washed in Acetone and resuspended in Laemmli buffer . Primary tumors and lymph nodes were surgically removed before any radiation , hormonal or chemo-therapy , using a cohort of patients ( n = 649 ) treated at the Institut Curie from 2005 to 2006 . In this cohort , 502 invasive ductal carcinomas were selected for Ral detection; after discarding the samples with staining problems , the final numbers of analyzed cases were n = 466 for RalA and n = 448 for RalB . Tissue microarrays ( TMA ) consisted of replicated tumor cores ( 1 mm diameter ) selected from whole-tumor tissue sections and a matched tissue core from adjacent non-tumoral breast epithelium ( referred to as normal breast tissue ) . Immunoistochemistry ( IHC ) staining was performed using a Dako Autostainer Plus according to previously published protocols ( Lodillinsky et al . , 2016 ) . Antibodies were: anti-RalB ( #WH0005899M4 , clone 4D1 , Sigma-Aldrich ) , anti-RalA ( #610222 , BD Transduction Laboratories ) . H-scores were calculated using the following formula: stained cell percentage x stain intensity/100 . Analysis of human samples was performed in accordance with the French Bioethics Law 2004–800 , the French National Institute of Cancer ( INCa ) Ethics Charter , and after approval by the Institut Curie review board and ethics committee ( Comité de Pilotage du Groupe Sein ) that waived the need for written informed consent from the participants . Women were informed of the research use of their tissues . Data were analyzed anonymously . Results are shown as mean ± standard deviation ( SD ) or standard error of the mean ( SEM ) . Statistical analysis was performed using Graphpad Prism ( v5 . 0 ) and R Software v . 3 . 3 . 2 ( R Core Team , 2016 ) . Comparisons between two groups were assessed using Student t-test . Comparisons between more than two groups were assessed using one-way ANOVA test . Comparisons between paired data were assessed using Wilcoxon signed-rank test . For breast cancer H-score analysis , Shapiro-Wilk normality test and non-parametric Mann-Whitney tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank test for paired data were used . p values less than 0 . 05 were considered significant ."}

It can involve a weak heart , narrowed arteries , narrowed heart valves , or the main arteries of the heart switching places . These conditions can be fatal if untreated and often need surgery to correct . The mother’s blood sugar levels during pregnancy can have a large effect on how likely the baby is to have congenital heart disease . If a pregnant woman has poorly controlled diabetes with rapidly fluctuating sugar levels , she may be at a higher risk of having a child with the condition . High sugar levels in the mother’s blood make the baby up to five times more likely to have congenital heart disease . It has been difficult to find out exactly how sugar levels interfere with heart development because diabetes can affect the fetus in many ways . Nakano et al . used stem cells and experiments in pregnant mice with diabetes to hone in on how high sugar levels affect the fetus’s heart development . First , heart cells were grown from human stem cells , and exposed to high levels of glucose in a dish . This revealed a new mechanism for how high sugar levels affect heart formation: the cells created too many nucleotides , the building blocks of molecules such as DNA . It turns out that high glucose levels boosted a chemical process in the cell known as the pentose phosphate pathway . Some of the products of this pathway are nucleotides . This made the cells divide rapidly , but did not allow them to mature well compared with cells exposed to normal levels of sugar . In another experiment , Nakano et al . found similar results in pregnant diabetic mice . The heart cells in mouse fetuses also divided quickly but matured slowly when exposed to high sugar levels . An estimated 60 million women at an age to have children have diabetes . These new findings help us to understand why and how these women are more likely to have children with congenital heart disease , and further study will hopefully lead to a better way to prevent this condition .", "article": "1 Introduction Congenital heart disease ( CHD ) is the most common type of birth defect affecting 0 . 8% of human live births ( Fahed et al . , 2013 ) . Although genetic factors play a significant role in the development of CHD , current genomic technologies , including exome sequencing and SNP arrays , have provided a genetic diagnosis for only 11% of the probands ( Gelb et al . , 2013 ) , highlighting the crucial role of non-genetic contributors . Among the non-genetic factors that influence the fetal heart , maternal hyperglycemia is the most common medical condition , associated with a 2–5-fold increase in CHD independent of genetic contributors ( Centers for Disease Control , 1990; Simeone et al . , 2015; Yogev and Visser , 2009 ) . Diabetic pregnancy is often accompanied by maternal complications including vasculopathy , neuropathy , and insulin resistance , which potentially affect fetal cardiac formation indirectly . These systemic complications are often subclinical , hindering the dissection of the pathomechanism of CHD in diabetic pregnancy . Thus , despite the established association between maternal hyperglycemia and malformation of the fetal heart , little is known about how glucose levels impact cardiomyocyte development and how hyperglycemia affects heart formation in diabetic pregnancy ( Gaspar et al . , 2014 ) . The metabolic environment is one potential non-genetic determinant of cell proliferation and differentiation . Cells display distinct metabolic characteristics depending on their differentiation stage ( Carey et al . , 2015; Tohyama et al . , 2016; Wang et al . , 2009 ) , and the fuel type used by the cells serves not merely as a source of energy but also as a critical regulator of self-renewal and differentiation of stem or progenitor cells ( Harris et al . , 2013; Oburoglu et al . , 2014; Shiraki et al . , 2014; Shyh-Chang et al . , 2013 ) . However , little is known about the mechanism . Cardiomyocytes shift their energy substrate during late embryonic and neonatal stages ( Makinde et al . , 1998 ) . Glucose is the major energy source during the early developmental stages . Oxidative phosphorylation is low until E10 . 5 of developing rodent hearts and rapidly increases between E10 . 5 and E14 . 5 ( Cox and Gunberg , 1972 ) . This coincides with the rapid maturation of the mitochondrial structure in embryonic cardiomyocytes ( Mackler et al . , 1971 ) . Shortly after birth , fatty acid oxidation becomes the predominant source of ATP production to meet the high energy demand of the maturing heart ( Warshaw and Terry , 1970 ) . These metabolic changes occur as a consequence of changes in the expression of metabolic enzymes and transporters . However , it remains unclear whether and how these metabolic changes , in turn , regulate the cardiac differentiation program . Here , we describe the use of in vitro human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes ( hESC-CMs ) and an in vivo murine diabetic model to show that glucose not only induces cardiomyocyte proliferation but also inhibits cardiomyocyte maturation . Glucose can be metabolized in multiple catabolic and anabolic pathways , including glycolysis , oxidative phosphorylation , the pentose phosphate pathway ( PPP ) and the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway . Our chemical screening revealed that the pro-mitotic and anti-maturation effect of high glucose is regulated by glucose-derived deoxynucleotide biosynthesis through PPP . In vivo measurement of 18F-FDG accumulation revealed that glucose uptake is drastically suppressed during the late gestational and early postnatal stages . Exposure to high blood glucose in a murine model of diabetic pregnancy resulted in higher mitosis and delayed maturation of fetal cardiomyocytes in vivo . Together , our data uncover how the dynamics of glucose metabolism impact late embryonic cardiogenesis . 2 Results hESC-CMs were differentiated in monolayer in a chemically defined condition , reproducibly yielding ~90% of MF20+ cardiomyocytes at day 14 with multiple cell lines including WA09 ( H9 ) and UCLA4 hESCs ( Figure 1A–C ) ( Arshi et al . , 2013; Minami et al . , 2012 ) . hESC-CMs start to beat synchronously at around day 6–7 in our system . To characterize the differentiation stages , mRNA expression profiles from H9 hESC-CMs were serially examined by RNA-seq at five distinct stages ( GSE84815 ) : undifferentiated hESC ( day 0 ) ; mesodermal precursor stage ( hMP , day 2 ) ; cardiac progenitor stage ( hCP , day 5 ) ; immature cardiomyocyte ( hCM14 ) ; and hESC-CMS differentiated for 14 additional days ( hCM28 ) . The expression data were analyzed using signatures collected from MSigDB , a body atlas and primary cell atlas ( Mabbott et al . , 2013; Su et al . , 2004; Subramanian et al . , 2005 ) . As expected , the stem cell signature decreases during these five stages , while signatures associated with heart and smooth muscle increase , further suggesting that our protocol leads to a high degree of enrichment for cardiomyocytes ( Figure 1D and E ) . This differentiation course is comparable to that reported in previous publications ( Paige et al . , 2012; Wamstad et al . , 2012 ) . To examine the impact of glucose levels on cardiac differentiation , hESC-CMs were cultured in media containing various concentration of glucose , starting at the hCM14 stage when cells are already differentiated to immature cardiomyocytes ( Figure 2A , Video 1 and 2 ) . The basal differentiation medium contains 25 mM glucose , 0 . 9 mM pyruvate , essential and nonessential amino acids , and human albumin ( G25 medium ) . Interestingly , glucose dose-dependently suppressed the expression of TNNT2 ( a cardiac marker ) , NKX2-5 ( a cardiac marker ) , and PPARGC1A ( a mitochondrial marker ) ( Figure 2B ) . Gene expression profiling by RNA-seq revealed that genes that are related to cardiac muscle and function are enriched in hESC-CMs in low glucose medium , and that genes that are associated with mitosis and cell cycle are enriched in the high-glucose group genome-wide ( Figure 2C , Figure 2—figure supplement 1B; GSE84814 ) . These data suggest that low glucose after day 14 induces the differentiation and suppresses the cell cycle of hESC-CMs . To validate these results , hESC-CM proliferation was analyzed by pH3 staining and EdU flow cytometry analysis . Low glucose decreased mitotic activity at day 28 without affecting the viability of hESC-CMs ( Figure 2D , E ) . In addition , hESC-CMs in low glucose medium showed more robust staining of α-actinin , although the sarcomere length did not significantly change ( Figure 2F , Figure 2—figure supplement 1B ) . MitoTracker staining and flow cytometry analyses revealed that hESC-CMs cultured in low glucose media have increased mitochondrial contents and inter-myofibrillar distribution of mitochondria , characteristic of differentiated cardiomyocytes ( Figure 2F and G ) . Addition of 2-DG ( 2-deoxy-D-glucose ) , a competitive inhibitor of glucose phosphorylation , induced higher levels of MitoTracker and MF20 expression even in the presence of 5 mM or 25 mM glucose ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1C ) , suggesting that the effect is specific to glucose and not to changes in osmotic pressure . Consistently , flow cytometry showed a significant increase in cell size under glucose-restricted conditions ( Figure 2I ) . Together , these results demonstrate that glucose dose-dependently suppresses the maturation of cardiomyocyte cellular architecture and the upregulation of cardiac genes in hESC-CMs . We next compared the metabolic and functional maturity of hESC-CMs cultured in the presence and absence of glucose by six methods . First , hESC-CMs were stained with JC-1 , a green fluorescent dye that generates red fluorescence upon formation of aggregates in active mitochondria . The level of red fluorescence is often used as an indicator of mitochondrial membrane potential and , therefore , mitochondrial activity . Immunofluorescent staining revealed that mitochondria in glucose-reduced hESC-CMs are more elongated ( Figure 3A ) , and flow cytometry analysis revealed that the level of JC-1 aggregation is significantly higher in glucose-reduced hESC-CMs cultured in both regular 0 . 9 mM and 10 mM pyruvate conditions . ( Figure 3B ) . These data suggest that high glucose inhibits the functional maturation of mitochondria . Second , intracellular lactate levels of hESC-CMs were measured using Laconic , a fluorescence resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) -based lactate nanosensor ( San Martín et al . , 2013 ) . After glucose deprivation , the Laconic construct was introduced into hESC-CMs via adenovirus as described previously ( John et al . , 2008 ) . In hESC-CMs differentiated in standard 25 mM glucose , bath-applied lactate ( 4 mM ) caused a rapid increase in intracellular lactate ( measured as a decrease FRET ratio ) , demonstrating the efficacy of the probe . Subsequent addition of pyruvate evoked a similar but smaller elevation of intracellular lactate . Under these conditions , inhibition of mitochondrial respiration with sodium cyanide ( NaCN ) had only a minor effect on the intracellular lactate level . This result suggests that hESC-CMs that are differentiated in standard 25 mM glucose do not actively metabolize pyruvate ( Figure 3C , upper panel ) . By contrast , addition of 4 mM pyruvate to glucose-reduced hESC-CMs did not cause intracellular lactate accumulation , and addition of NaCN in the presence of pyruvate resulted in a substantial increase in lactate level . This result is consistent with pyruvate utilization by mitochondria ( Figure 3C , lower panel ) . Together , these data suggest that mitochondria metabolize pyruvate in hESC-CMs that are cultured in glucose-reduced conditions , but not in the presence of glucose . Third , we assessed cellular respiration of hESC-CM using the XF24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer ( Seahorse Bioscience ) , in which oxygen consumption rate ( OCR ) was measured in real time in a basal state and in response to oligomycin ( an ATP synthase inhibitor ) , FCCP ( carbonilcyanide p-triflouromethoxyphenylhydrazone , a mitochondrial uncoupler ) , and rotenone or myxothiazol ( complex I or III inhibitors , respectively ) ( Figure 3D ) . Although base-line mitochondrial respiration was not changed ( Figure 3E ) , ATP-linked respiration was elevated in the no glucose condition ( Figure 3F and G ) . Glucose-reduced hESC-CMs also demonstrated substantially larger maximum respiration capacity , as indicated by the response to FCCP ( Figure 3H ) . These results corroborate the increased capacity of cellular respiration in hESC-CMs cultured under low glucose conditions . Fourth , the Ca2+ kinetics of hESC-CMs were assessed using a Ca2+ transient assay ( Shimizu et al . , 2015 ) . Although the peak amplitude of the transient ( ΔF/F0 ) did not show a significant difference , the maximum upstroke ( Vmax ) was significantly faster and the time to 50% decay was significantly shorter in the glucose-reduced group ( Figure 3I ) . This pattern is consistent with the previous report demonstrating the role of thyroid hormone on hiPSC-CM maturation ( Yang et al . , 2014 ) , and suggestive of an inhibitory role of high glucose on hESC-CM maturation . Fifth , taking advantage of our monolayer culture system , we examined electrophysiological properties , using a multi-electrode array ( MEA ) culture plate as reported previously ( Zhu et al . , 2017 ) . Maximum upstroke velocity ( dV/dtmax ) of field potential is a reliable parameter for approximating the electrophysiological maturity of cardiomyocytes derived from pluripotent stem cells ( Haase et al . , 2009; Ma et al . , 2011; Zhang et al . , 2009 ) . Compared with hESC-CMs cultured in 25 mM glucose , those hESC-CMs cultured in the absence of glucose displayed a significant increase in dV/dtmax ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–C ) . Finally , the monolayer culture method allowed us to measure cell contractility by digital image correlation using the MotionGUI program ( Huebsch et al . , 2015 ) . Both average maximum contraction speed and average maximum relaxation speed were higher in those hESC-CMs cultured in 0 mM glucose ( Figure 3J ) . Together , these data suggest that glucose reduction promotes the functional maturation of hESC-CMs at the metabolic , electrophysiological , and biomechanical levels . Having determined that glucose reduction induces cardiac maturation at morphological , genetic metabolic , and functional levels , we next sought to analyze the mechanism by which glucose blocks cardiac maturation . Glucose is metabolized by multiple pathways involving both catabolic reactions ( anaerobic glycolysis and the aerobic TCA cycle ) and anabolic reactions ( PPP , the hexosamine pathway , etc . ) . We first examined the impact of glucose reduction on the global metabolomics signature . Mass spectrometry revealed that glucose deprivation resulted in a significant decrease in the levels of the metabolites in purine metabolism , pyrimidine metabolism , the PPP , the hexosamine pathway , and glycolysis , whereas lipid precursors , amino acids , glutamine , and glutamate , as well as urea cycle metabolites , were not significantly affected ( Figure 4A and Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) . ATP levels were not significantly different under glucose-restricted conditions ( Figure 4B ) , neither were any specific stress pathways significantly increased when examined by RNA-seq , suggesting that the cells were not energy-starved in the absence of glucose in the cell culture media . To identify the metabolic pathway responsible for the improved cardiac maturation by glucose reduction , we conducted a systematic screening using chemical inhibitors for the various glucose metabolic pathways in the monolayer 384-well format ( Figure 4C ) . Consistent with flow cytometry for MitoTracker and MF20 ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1C ) , 2-DG dose-dependently abolished the glucose-dependent inhibition of TNNT2 and NKX2-5 mRNA levels in hESC-CM ( Figure 4D and Figure 4—figure supplement 4A ) . 3PO ( 3-[3-pyridinyl]-1-[4-pyridinyl]-2-propen-1-one ) , an inhibitor of the phosphofructokinase PFKFB3 ( which is a regulator of PFK1 ) , did not affect the level of hESC-CM maturity at any concentration of glucose ( Figure 4E and Figure 4—figure supplement 4B ) . The failure of 3PO to recapitulate the effect of glucose deprivation suggests that glucose metabolites downstream of PFK1 are not essential for the glucose-dependent inhibition of cardiac maturation . Consistently , sodium oxamate ( a lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] inhibitor ) did not block the inhibitory effect of glucose ( Figure 4F and Figure 4—figure supplement 4C ) . Interestingly , however , 6AN ( 6-[cyclohexa-2 , 5-dien-1-ylideneamino] naphthalene-2-sulfonate ) and DHEA ( didehydroepiandrosterone ) , both inhibitors of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase ( G6PD ) in the oxidative arm of the PPP , recapitulated glucose reduction ( Figure 4G and H , Figure 4—figure supplement 4D–E ) . As summarized in Figure 4—figure supplement 3 , our chemical inhibitor screening suggests that the PPP plays a critical role in the inhibition of cardiac maturation and that blocking this pathway by either use of chemical inhibitors or glucose deprivation induces cardiac maturation . Although mitochondria are a major source of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) and physiological levels of ROS promote cellular differentiation ( Crespo et al . , 2010 ) , the level of ROS measured by DCFDA ( dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate ) did not increase in the absence of glucose and neither did ROS inhibition had a significant impact on TNNT2 expression level ( Figure 4—figure supplement 3F ) , suggesting that the increase in ROS is not responsible for the induction of cardiac maturation . The oxidative arm of the PPP generates two major products: reducing power in the form of NADPH and 5-carbon sugars that supply the backbone for nucleotide biosynthesis . To test whether glucose level impacts cardiac maturation by affecting nucleotide biosynthesis , we rescued nucleotide synthesis by adding uridine to hESC-CMs cultured in low glucose media . Under glucose starvation , supplementation of uridine is known to rescue the growth of bacteria , yeast and malignant cells ( Linker et al . , 1985 ) . In our hESC-CM culture system , uridine restored cell proliferation even in low-glucose conditions ( Figure 5A and B ) . Interestingly , uridine dose-dependently reduced the level of TNNT2 even in glucose-deprived conditions ( Figure 5C and Figure 5—figure supplement 1A ) , suggesting that glucose-mediated inhibition of cardiac maturation is dependent on the supply of nucleotides and not of NADPH . In order to test whether nucleotides are necessary for the glucose-dependent inhibition of cardiac maturation , nucleotide biosynthesis was blocked by multiple methods . Addition of an excess amount of thymidine ( unlike uridine ) blocks the synthesis of DNA by inhibiting the formation of deoxycytidine ( i . e . , the thymidine block method ) , which is commonly used to synchronize the cell cycle ( Reichard et al . , 1960; Xeros , 1962 ) . When excess thymidine was added to hESC-CMs , the expression of TNNT2 and NKX2-5 were increased ( Figure 5D and Figure 5—figure supplement 1B ) . To further confirm this effect , we blocked deoxynucleotide synthesis by hydroxyurea ( HU ) , an inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase ( RNR ) that catalyzes the formation of deoxyribo-nucleotides . Consistent with the results from thymidine block , HU dose-dependently induced the expression of TNNT2 and NKX2-5 ( Figure 5E and Figure 5—figure supplement 1C ) . RNAi-based knockdown of RRM2B , a key subunit of RNR , also resulted in a significant increase in TNNT2 expression level , even in the presence of 25 mM glucose ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2 ) . Together , these gain- and loss-of-function data suggest that nucleotide biosynthesis is a key regulatory pathway of the pro-mitotic–anti-maturation effect of glucose . Nucleotide synthesis is a key step in DNA replication and thus cell cycling . Therefore , it is not clear whether the maturation of hESC-CMs that results from deprivation of glucose is due to the cell-cycle block in general or to the effects of nucleotides themselves . To examine whether cell-cycle arrest in general is an essential trigger for cardiac maturation , we blocked the mitotic activity of hESC-CMs by a CDK4/6 inhibitor and paclitaxel ( Taxol; an inhibitor of microtubule breakdown ) , both of which block the cell cycle without directly inhibiting the nucleotide kinetics . Interestingly , neither CDK4/6 inhibitor nor paclitaxel induced cardiac maturation ( Figure 5—figure supplement 2A–B ) . Together , these data suggest that cell-cycle arrest by itself is not crucial for the promotion of cardiac maturation . Rather , nucleotide deprivation is a key mechanism for cardiac maturation . These in vitro data suggest that glucose reduction promotes cardiac maturation while inhibiting cardiomyocyte proliferation . An intriguing possibility is that the same mechanism underlies cardiac maturation in the in vivo natural counterpart . During normal embryogenesis , however , the blood glucose level is primarily regulated by maternal metabolism and stays relatively stable in utero , leading us to hypothesize that cellular glucose uptake becomes restricted during late fetal stages . To test this possibility , we measured the glucose uptake in the fetal hearts using 18F-labeled 2-deoxy-2-fluoroglucose ( FDG ) . 18F-labeled FDG was injected intravenously via the maternal tail vein at E10 . 5 , E12 . 5 , and E15 . 5 or intraperitoneally into P1 and P7 pups . After 2 hr , the mice were imaged by PET/CT , the hearts were dissected , and cardiac accumulation was measured quantitatively . Interestingly , the normalized cardiac accumulation progressively and rapidly decreased from E10 . 5 to P7 , with 0 . 11% and 0 . 05% 18F-FDG uptake in P1 and P7 hearts , respectively , compared to E10 . 5 hearts ( Figure 6 ) . These data suggest that cardiac glucose uptake becomes significantly restricted during late gestational and early postnatal stages , creating an intracellular glucose deprivation condition during natural in vivo development . We next tested whether hyperglycemia promotes the proliferation and inhibits the maturation of cardiomyocytes in vivo using fetuses and neonates from diabetic pregnancy . Akita heterozygous mice carry a single amino-acid substitution in the Ins2 gene and exhibit multiple disorders associated with maturity-onset diabetes of the young ( MODY ) ( Barber et al . , 2005; Fujita et al . , 2001; Wang et al . , 1999; Yaguchi et al . , 2003; Yoshioka et al . , 1997 ) . By crossing an Akita female with a wild-type male , we created a diabetic pregnancy condition in which wild-type fetuses ( half of the pups in the litters ) and their littermates are exposed to hyperglycemia ( Figure 7A ) . In the C57BL/6 background , the average blood-glucose levels of the Akita mothers that we used were significantly higher than those of sex-matched control littermates ( 215 ± 84 vs 71 ± 12 mg/dl , respectively; p<0 . 0005 ) . Fetal and neonatal Tnnt2+ cardiomyocytes from wild-type hearts from wild-type mothers and wild-type hearts from Akita mothers were examined for mitotic activity in an in vivo EdU incorporation assay at E16 . 5 and P0 stages , when cardiomyocytes are not yet multinucleated or multiploidic . As shown in Figure 7B and C , the number of cardiomyocytes in S phase was significantly higher at both E16 . 5 and P0 in the diabetes group . Histological analyses showed that the number of phosphorylated histone H3-positive cardiomyocytes ( pH3+/Tnnt2+ ) is higher at E16 . 5 in the embryos from diabetic pregnancies ( Figure 7D and E ) . These data suggest that fetal cardiomyocytes are more mitotic when exposed to maternal hyperglycemia . To examine whether hyperglycemia inhibits the maturation of fetal cardiomyocytes in vivo , we analyzed the fetal and neonatal hearts from diabetic pregnancies . The level of Tnnt2 expression was significantly lower in the hearts from the diabetic pregnancies ( Figure 7F ) . A hallmark of the congenital heart disease associated with diabetic pregnancy is asymmetric cardiac hypertrophy . Although heart weight/body weight ratio did not show a difference in our mouse model , the thickness of left and right ventricular free walls was significantly increased in the hearts from diabetic pregnancies at P1 ( Figure 7G ) . Consistently , the cardiomyocyte size measured by flow cytometry was significantly smaller in the diabetic pregnancy group ( Figure 7H ) . These data suggest that overproliferation and/or delayed maturation underlie the pathological mechanism of cardiomyopathy associated with diabetic pregnancy . 3 Discussion Glucose is the most fundamental and commonly available nutrient for the cells . Hence , the activity of the glucose metabolic pathways is tightly regulated in cells . Glucose is broken down to extract energy through the glycolysis pathway and also shunts to supply 5-carbon sugars and NADPH through the PPP . In our study , chemical inhibition of glucose metabolic pathways in hESC-CMs revealed that it is not the catabolic breakdown of glucose to extract energy but rather the anabolic use of glucose to build nucleotides that is responsible for the glucose-dependent inhibition of cardiac maturation . Most of the proliferating cells synthesize nucleotides de novo from glucose , glutamine , and CO2 . In our hESC-CM experiments , blocking the PPP and nucleotide biosynthesis inhibited the glucose-mediated induction of mitosis and suppression of maturation , and supplementation of nucleotides was sufficient to recapitulate the effect of glucose ( Figures 4 and 5 ) . These data suggest that nucleotide biosynthesis via the PPP is the key regulator of the pro-mitotic/anti-maturation effect of glucose . Interestingly , cardiomyocyte maturation was not fully induced by blocking of the cell cycle with a CDK4/6 inhibitor or paclitaxel , neither of which directly impact the nucleotide kinetics . Therefore , it is not the cell cycle in general but the nucleotides themselves that blocks the maturation ( Figure 5—figure supplement 2 ) . It is well-documented that there is generally an inverse correlation between cell proliferation and differentiation during developmental stages ( Ruijtenberg and van den Heuvel , 2016 ) . Our data raise an intriguing possibility that nucleotide biosynthesis serves as a nodal point balancing cell proliferation and differentiation during development . Clinically , maternal diabetes can accompany multiple complications including neuropathy , microvasculopathy , nephropathy , and insulin resistance . Although meta-analysis predicts that hyperglycemia itself is a major teratogen during diabetic pregnancy ( Reece et al . , 1996 ) , it is often difficult to dissect the impacts of maternal complications on CHD as they are often subclinical . To our knowledge , our in vitro study is the first to demonstrate that environmental glucose itself , if excessive , directly impacts cardiac differentiation . The formation of the heart is regulated by both genetic and non-genetic factors , with the latter playing important roles particularly during late-stage cardiogenesis . An interesting aspect of the interaction between genetic and non-genetic mechanisms is that they seem to reinforce each other mutually . Our data suggest that the glucose metabolic environment is , on the one hand , a consequence of changes in cardiac genetic program , and on the other hand , a cause of the changes in cardiac gene expression . Understanding the metabolic signature of hESC-CMs will potentially open new methods for purifying these cells ( Tohyama et al . , 2016; Tohyama et al . , 2013 ) or inducing their maturation ( Drawnel et al . , 2014 ) . Considering that the inhibitors of the PPP and nucleotide biosynthesis have entered clinical trials for cancer treatment ( Tennant et al . , 2010; Vander Heiden , 2011 ) , our data raise the possibility that manipulating this pathway may allow us to control the proliferation and maturation of cardiomyocytes for regenerative medicine . With the advances in fetal diagnosis and surgical techniques , the number of CHD patients who survive childhood ( and so have adult CHD ) is growing rapidly by nearly 5% per year ( Brickner et al . , 2000 ) . Maternal hyperglycemia is a common medical condition associated with 2–5-fold increase in CHD ( Centers for Disease Control , 1990; Simeone et al . , 2015; Yogev and Visser , 2009 ) . Currently , 60 million women of reproductive age ( 18–44 years old ) worldwide and approximately 3 million in the U . S . have diabetes mellitus . This number is predicted to double by 2030 , posing a huge medical and economic burden ( Gabbay-Benziv et al . , 2015 ) . Our findings will lay a foundation for understanding how the glucose environment regulates cardiogenesis and how disturbance of non-genetic factors affects the genetic program during the pathological development of the heart . 4 Materials and methods Wild-type and Akita mice were maintained on the C57BL/6 background according to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the US National Institute of Health ( NIH Publication No . 85–23 , revised 1996 ) . Housing and experiments were performed according to the Institutional Approval for Appropriate Care and Use of Laboratory Animals by the UCLA Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee ( Protocol #2008-127-07 ) . H9 ( WA09 ) and UCLA4 ( UCLA stem cell core ) hESC lines were maintained as described before ( Arshi et al . , 2013 ) . Authentication of hESCs was achieved by confirming the expression of pluripotency genes and protein markers . hESCs were routinely verified as mycoplasma-free using a PCR-based assay . hESCs were grown and differentiated in a chemically defined condition ( Minami et al . , 2012; Young et al . , 2016; Zhu et al . , 2017 ) . Usage of all the human embryonic stem cell lines is approved by the UCLA Embryonic Stem Cell Research Oversight ( ESCRO ) Committee and the Institutional Review Boards ( IRB ) ( approval #2009-006-04 ) . For the RNA-seq analyses shown in Figures 1D , E and 2C , RNA was extracted from hESC , hMP , hCP , hCM14 , hCM28 , hCM28 ( in 25 mM glucose ) and hCM28 ( in 0 mM glucose ) using TRIZOL ( TheroFisher ) and RNeasy kit ( QIAGEN ) . 500 ng of DNaseI-treated RNA was used as input material for library preparation using the Illumina TruSeq mRNA kit ( Illumina , RS-122–2001 ) , according to manufacturer’s instructions . Final libraries were sequenced as single-end 50 bp on the Illumina HiSeq2000 platform ( GSE84814 ) . Libraries for RNA-Seq shown in Figures 1D , E and 2C were prepared with the KAPA Stranded RNA-Seq Kit . The workflow consists of mRNA enrichment , cDNA generation , end repair , A-tailing , adaptor ligation , strand selection and PCR amplification . Different adaptors were used for multiplexing samples in one lane . Sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 3000 for a paired end 2 × 150 run ( GSE84815 ) . A data quality check was done on an Illumina SAV . De-multiplexing was performed with the Illumina Bcl2fastq2 v 2 . 17 program . Short read sequences generated from an Illumina Sequencer were aligned to the UCSC human reference genome hg19 downloaded from support . Illumina . com ( http://support . illumina . com/sequencing/sequencing_software/igenome . html ) using TopHat from the Tuxedo Tools . The average overall read mapping rate reached over 82 percent ( average = 82 . 43 percent ) . The output was in the form of BAM ( Binary Sequence Alignment/Map format ) files . These outputs contain information for assigning location and quantifying the short-read alignments obtained from the RNA-seq samples . This is necessary for downstream analyses such as annotation , transcript abundance comparison and polymorphism detection . Counts or gene expression matrices were generated using HTSeq , which quantified the reads per transcript . The expression matrices were log transformed and normalized using the rlog function in the Deseq2 package . The normalized gene expression matrices were used as input for SaVanT ( Signature Visualization Tools ) , which allowed for the visualization of molecular signatures directly related to heart development as seen in Figures 1D , E and 2C . hESC-CMs and mouse embryonic hearts were washed three times with PBS and incubated at 37°C in a dissociation enzyme solution with occasional pipetting to a single-cell suspension . The enzyme solution contained 1% penicillin/streptomycin ( ThermoFisher , 15140–122 ) , 10% fetal bovine serum ( Hyclone ) , collagenase 2 mg/ml ( Worthington , CLS-2 ) , dispase 0 . 25 mg/ml ( Gibco , 17105–041 ) , and DNAase I ( ThermoFisher ) in PBS . The cells were analyzed with the following antibodies: MF20 ( mouse , 1:100 , Hybridoma Bank ) , Tnnt2 ( rabbit , 1:250 , Sigma-Aldrich ) , MitoTracker Orange CMTMRos ( ThermoFisher ) , JC-1 ( Abcam ) , and EdU ( 100 μl of 10 mM EdU solution per 10 g of mouse , ThermoFisher ) . For MF20 and Tnnt2 , FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody ( BD Biosciences ) was used . Stained cells were analyzed by a flow cytometer ( LSRII , BD Biosciences ) . Data analysis was performed using FACSDiva ( BD Biosciences ) . Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde , blocked for an hour with 5% normal goat serum , and incubated with mouse alpha actinin antibody ( Sigma ) followed by Alexa fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody ( ThermoFisher ) . Images were taken with Zeiss LSM780 confocal microscopy . Sarcomere lengths were analyzed using Zeiss Zen software . Total DNA including mtDNA was extracted from cells using the PureLink DNA kit ( ThermoFisher ) , and DNA purity and quantity were determined using a spectrophotometer . To determine the ratio between mitochondrial and nuclear DNA , qRT-PCR was performed on a Roche Lightcycler 480 using SYBR Green dye . Mitochondrial gene expression was corrected for nuclear gene expression values , and normalized to the value of the control group for each experiment as described before . Forward and reverse primer sequences are as follows: UUR forward , CAC CCA AGA ACA GGG TTT GT; UUR reverse , TGG CCA TGG GTA TGT TGT TA for mt DNA; B2-microglobulin forward , TGC TGT CTC CAT GTT TGA TGT ATC T; and B2-microglobulin reverse , TCT CTG CTC CCC ACC TCT AAG T . Ca2+ transient was measured as described ( Shimizu et al . , 2015 ) . Briefly , hESC-CMs cultured in the presence or absence of glucose were loaded with 5 µM fluo-4 AM and imaged in Tyrode buffer containing 138 . 2 mM NaCl , 4 . 6 mM KCl , 1 . 2 mM MgCl , 15 mM glucose and 20 mM HEPES according to the manufacturer’s instruction . Images were recorded on a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope . Data analysis was carried out using the Zeiss Zen and ImageJ . Contractility assessments were performed by utilizing a video-based technique with the UCSF Gladstone-developed Matlab program MotionGUI ( Huebsch et al . , 2015 ) . The videos were converted from . mts to . avi format at native resolution using commercially available software and loaded into the MotionGUI program . The conversion between pixels and real distance was performed within the MotionGUI program using a reference image with unit divisions of 100 um , taken under the same objective and video zoom settings as the cell videos , to yield a pixel size of 0 . 681125 . This pixel size was used for all contractility assessments . Motion vectors were calculated and the data were evaluated upon completion . All samples were subjected to the same post-processing procedures in order to ensure consistency during comparative analysis . Each video sample was post-processed using neighbor-based cleaning with the vector-based cleaning criterion within the program . The threshold for this post-processing method was set to two for all samples and was adequate for improving the signal-to-noise ratio enough to identify peaks clearly corresponding to beating events in most samples . A small number of videos suffering from significant noise issues were separately subjected to fast Fourier transform ( FFT ) frequency domain cleaning with a cut-off frequency of 1 Hz . Only one post-processing method was applied to one video at one time . All other parameters of the MotionGUI program not outlined here were set to their respective default values . The lactate biosensor Laconic was a gift from Dr . Barros ( San Martín et al . , 2013 ) . Overexpression of Laconic in hESC-CM was achieved using engineered adenoviruses encoding the construct . Expression of the construct was sufficiently high after 36–48 hr for FRET experiments or microscopy imaging . All cells were imaged live without fixation . Images ( 16 bit ) were acquired using a microscope ( Eclipse TE300; Nikon ) fitted with a 60× ( 1 . 4 NA ) oil immersion lens ( Nikon ) and equipped with a filter cube comprising a CFP bandpass excitation filter , 436/20b , together with a longpass dichroic mirror ( 455DCLP; Chroma Technology Corp ) . Two LEDs ( Philips Lumileds ) , one emitting at 455 ± 20 nm ( royal blue ) and the other emitting at 505 ± 15 nm ( cyan ) were used as light sources . Ratiometric FRET measurements were obtained from the YFP and CFP images acquired simultaneously using a Dual View image splitter ( Optical Insights ) equipped with a 505 nm longpass dichroic filter to separate the CFP and YFP signals , a CFP emission filter ( 480/30 ) , and a YFP emission filter ( 535/40 ) ( John et al . , 2008 ) . Images were captured with a Cascade 512B digital camera ( Photometrics ) . Reagents indicated in Figure 3C were added and followed by washing . hESC-CMs were seeded onto a matrigel-coated XF24 Cell Culture Microplate ( Seahorse Bioscience ) at 2–7 . 5 104 cells/well with or without glucose ( 25 mM glucose of cardiac differentiation media ) . Oxygen consumption rate ( OCR ) was measured using an XF24 Extracellular Flux Analyser ( Seahorse Bioscience ) in unbuffered DMEM assay medium supplemented with 1 mM pyruvate , 2 mM glutamine and with or without 25 mM glucose . OCR was measured before and after the sequential addition of 0 . 75 µM oligomycin , 0 . 5 µM FCCP and 0 . 75 µM of rotenone/myxothiazol . OCR was normalized to protein concentration using a Bradford assay ( Bio-Rad ) . Mitochondrial respiration was calculated as the difference between total and rotenone/myxothiazol rates . Maximal respiration was the response to FCCP . ATP-linked respiration was represented by the oligomycin-sensitive respiration rate , whereas uncoupled respiration was represented by the difference between oligomycin and rotenone/myxothiazol rates . hESC-CMs at the stage of hCM14 were plated on microelectrode arrays ( MEAs ) containing 120 integrated TiN electrodes ( 30 µm diameter , 200 µm interelectrode spacing ) . The MEAs were placed in an incubator with a temperature of 37°C and 5% CO2 . Two days were given to allow the cardiomyocytes to well attach the MEAs before recording started . Local field potentials at each electrode were collected over a period of 5 min every day in total with a sampling rate of 1 KHz using the MEA2100-HS120 system ( Multichannel systems , Reutlingen , Germany ) . Data analysis was carried out using the MC_DataTool ( Multichannel Systems ) , Origin ( OriginLab Corporation ) and Matlab ( MathWorks ) . Data shown are based on three independent hESC-CM preparations . The experiments were performed as described ( Krall et al . , 2016 ) . Briefly , cells were seeded in 6-well plates , so that the final cell count at the time of metabolite extraction was about 7*105 and this was even across all cell lines . To extract intracellular metabolites , cells were briefly rinsed with cold 150 mM ammonium acetate ( pH 7 . 3 ) , followed by the addition of 1 ml cold 80% MeOH on dry ice . Cell scrapers were used to detach cells , and the cell suspension was transferred into Eppendorf tubes . Extracted metabolites were transferred into glass vials and dried down under vacuum . For the LC-MS-based analysis , the samples were resuspended in 70% acetonitrile and 50 μl were injected onto a Luna NH2 column ( 150 mm x 2 mm , Phenomenex ) . Separation was achieved using A ) 5 mM NH4AcO ( pH 9 . 9 ) and B ) ACN . The gradient started with 15% A ) going to 90% A ) over 18 min , followed by an isocratic step for 9 min and reversal to the initial 15% A ) for 7 min . Metabolites were quantified with TraceFinder 3 . 3 using accurate mass measurements ( ≤3 ppm ) and retention times of pure standards . Data analysis was performed using the statistical language R . RNA was extracted from the tissue or the cells cultured with a specific concentration of glucose together with or without titrated metabolic pathway inhibitors using the Direct-zol RNA mini prep kit ( Zymo research ) . RNA was reverse-transcribed into complementary DNA using the qScript cDNA synthesis kit ( Quanta Biosciences ) . Quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR was performed using Viia7 ( Applied Biosystems/ThermoFisher ) . In Figures 1B , 2B and 4C–E , Figure 4—figure supplement 3A–E , Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–C , and Figure 5—figure supplement 2A–B , each bar represents the average of biological duplicates with at least three independent wells , each of which is triplicated for qPCR reaction . The relative mRNA level is normalized to the expression level of 25 mM glucose without any chemicals . Forward and reverse primer sequences are as follows: GAPDH forward , TTGAGGTCAATGAAGGGGTC; GAPDH reverse , GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTCA; TNNT2 forward , CAGAGCGGAAAAGTGGGAAGA; TNNT2 reverse , TCGTTGATCCTGTTTCGGAGA; NKX2-5 forward , GTTGTCCGCCTCTGTCTTCT;NKX2-5 reverse , TCTATCCACGTGCCTACAGC; PPARGC1A forward , GGTGCCTTCAGTTCACTCTCA; and PPARGC1A reverse , AACCAGAGCAGCACACTCGAT . 18F-FDG was obtained from the UCLA Department of Nuclear Medicine . Warmed pregnant mice or pups were injected intravenously or intraperitoneally , respectively , with ~90 microCi ( ~3 . 33 MBq ) of 18F-FDG . After 2 hr , the mice were sacrificed . Preliminary experiments suggested that 2 hr was sufficiently long for 18F-FDG to reach maximum accumulation in each organ and embryo . Fetal or neonatal hearts were separated from the other tissue ( carcass ) , and the mass and radioactivity in both the hearts and the carcasses were measured using a standard balance and a Wizard 3’ automatic gamma counter ( Perkin Elmer ) , respectively . The radioactivity levels in the pup carcasses were higher than the detection limit of the gamma counter , so the expected gamma counter values for the pup carcasses were calculated on the basis of the decay-corrected injected dose of 18F-FDG and known conversion values between microCi and CPM on the gamma counter . To calculate the ‘Normalized FDG accumulation’ , radioactive accumulation in each heart was divided by heart weight and then further divided by the total radioactivity in each embryo or pup . This last normalization is to account for differences in 18F-FDG injected dose and accessibility to the embryos and pups . Averages and standard errors of the mean ( SEM ) were calculated , and the values were normalized such that E10 . 5 embryo FDG accumulation was set to 100 . Mouse embryos were isolated in cold PBS and fixed in 4% PFA for 1~2 hr , followed by equilibration in 30% sucrose in PBS solution overnight . The tissues were placed in 1:1 30% sucrose/OCT ( Tissue-Tek , Electron Microscopy Sciences ) solution for 1–2 hr , then in 100% OCT compound for 1 hr at 4°C , and embedded in 100% OCT compound , carefully oriented in Cryomolds ( Ted Pella ) . The blocks were immediately frozen on dry ice with isopropanol and stored at −80°C . The sections were cut 5 μm with a Leica CM3050 S cryostat . The following primary and secondary antibodies were used: α-actinin ( mouse , 1:200 , Sigma-Aldrich ) , Phospho-Histone 3 ( rabbit , 1:250 , Millipore ) , as well as Alexa Fluor 488 ( green ) - and Alexa Fluor 594 ( red ) -conjugated secondary antibodies specific to the appropriate species , which were used ( 1:500; ThermoFisher ) for fluorescent staining . Sections were mounted with antifade mounting medium with DAPI ( ThermoFisher ) , and analyzed by using AxioImager D1 ( Carl Zeiss Microimaging , Inc ) . ANOVA and Student’s t-test were used to determine whether any statistically significant difference exists among independent groups ."}
{"doi": "elife-53930-v2", "abstract": "More than 30% of genes in higher eukaryotes are regulated by promoter-proximal pausing of RNA polymerase II ( Pol II ) . Phosphorylation of Pol II CTD by positive transcription elongation factor b ( P-TEFb ) is a necessary precursor event that enables productive transcription elongation . The exact mechanism on how the sequestered P-TEFb is released from the 7SK snRNP complex and recruited to Pol II CTD remains unknown . In this report , we utilize mouse and human models to reveal methylphosphate capping enzyme ( MePCE ) , a core component of the 7SK snRNP complex , as the cognate substrate for Jumonji domain-containing 6 ( JMJD6 ) ’s novel proteolytic function . Our evidences consist of a crystal structure of JMJD6 bound to methyl-arginine , enzymatic assays of JMJD6 cleaving MePCE in vivo and in vitro , binding assays , and downstream effects of Jmjd6 knockout and overexpression on Pol II CTD phosphorylation . We propose that JMJD6 assists bromodomain containing 4 ( BRD4 ) to recruit P-TEFb to Pol II CTD by disrupting the 7SK snRNP complex .", "plain language summary": "In animals , an enzyme known as RNA polymerase II ( Pol II for short ) is a key element of the transcription process , whereby the genetic information contained in DNA is turned into messenger RNA molecules in the cells , which can then be translated to proteins . To perform this task , Pol II needs to be activated by a complex of proteins called P-TEFb; however , P-TEFb is usually found in an inactive form held by another group of proteins . Yet , it is unclear how P-TEFb is released and allowed to activate Pol II . Scientists have speculated that another protein called JMJD6 ( Jumonji domain-containing 6 ) is important for P-TEFb to activate Pol II . Various roles for JMJD6 have been proposed , but its exact purpose remains unclear . Recently , two enzymes closely related to JMJD6 were found to be able to make precise cuts in other proteins; Lee , Liu et al . therefore wanted to test whether this is also true of JMJD6 . Experiments using purified JMJD6 showed that it could make a cut in an enzyme called MePCE , which belongs to the group of proteins that hold P-TEFb in its inactive form . Lee , Liu et al . then tested the relationships between these proteins in living human and mouse cells . The levels of activated Pol II were lower in cells without JMJD6 and higher in those without MePCE . Together , the results suggest that JMJD6 cuts MePCE to release P-TEFb , which then activates Pol II . JMJD6 appears to know where to cut by following a specific pattern of elements in the structure of MePCE . When MePCE was mutated so that the pattern changed , JMJD6 was unable to cut it . These results suggest that JMJD6 and related enzymes belong to a new family of proteases , the molecular scissors that can cleave other proteins . The molecules that regulate transcription often are major drug targets , for example in the fight against cancer . Ultimately , understanding the role of JMJD6 might help to identify new avenues for cancer drug development .", "article": "1 Introduction Mechanisms of transcription regulation in bacteria are very well established; transcription factors bind to specific DNA to recruit RNA Polymerases ( RNAP ) to carry out transcription ( Ptashne and Gann , 1997; Zhang et al . , 1999 ) . In eukaryotes , however , there are additional layers of regulation such as the nucleosome structures , which can prevent RNA Polymerases including RNA Polymerase I ( Pol I ) , RNA Polymerase II ( Pol II ) , and RNA Polymerase III ( Pol III ) from productive transcription due to high binding affinity between DNA and histones . Precisely how RNA Polymerases overcome nucleosomal barriers to undergo a productive transcription elongation and how Pol II pausing is regulated remain unanswered ( Zhou et al . , 2012; Jonkers and Lis , 2015; Core and Adelman , 2019 ) . In higher eukaryotes , over ~30% genes are regulated by Pol II promoter-proximal pausing ( Core et al . , 2008; Nechaev et al . , 2010; Min et al . , 2011 ) , which is resultant from nucleosome barriers at +1 position of transcription start sites ( Weber et al . , 2014; Voong et al . , 2016 ) . We recently discovered that a group of JmjC domain containing protein family including JMJD5 and JMJD7 specifically cleave histone tails and potentially generate tailless nucleosomes . The cleavage activity by JMJD5 and JMJD7 could be associated with the release of the promoter-proximal paused Pol II and may trigger Pol II into productive elongation in higher eukaryotes , such as mouse and human ( Liu et al . , 2017; Liu et al . , 2018 ) . The cleavage activity of JMJD5 on histone tails was also independently reported by another group ( Shen et al . , 2017 ) , thus cross-validating our respective discoveries . Compared to the efficient recruitment of P-TEFb ( including CDK9 and Cyclin T1 ) by TAT protein in human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) ( Peterlin et al . , 2012 ) , BRD4 is claimed to be responsible for the recruitment P-TEFb to the promoters of Pol II pausing regulated genes ( Jang et al . , 2005; Yang et al . , 2005; C Quaresma et al . , 2016 ) . However , the binding affinity between BRD4 and P-TEFb ( ~0 . 5 μM ) ( Itzen et al . , 2014 ) is much weaker than that that of TAT and P-TEFb ( ~3 nM ) ( Wei et al . , 1998; Tahirov et al . , 2010; Schulze-Gahmen et al . , 2014 ) , and BRD4 lacks a RNA binding motif ( Wu and Chiang , 2007 ) . Therefore , we hypothesize there must exist another factor to help BRD4 to recruit P-TEFb and engages in the instigation of Pol II transcription elongation . Besides the classic Bromo-domains which recognize acetylated histone tails , BRD4 contains an extra terminal domain ( ET ) recognizing JMJD6 ( Rahman et al . , 2011; Konuma et al . , 2017 ) . Incidentally , we found that JMJD6 nonspecifically binds to single stranded RNA with high affinity ( ~40 nM ) ( Hong et al . , 2010 ) . We propose that JMJD6 may be recruited by both BRD4 and newly transcribed RNAs from Pol II to help BRD4 recruit P-TEFb , acting analogously to that of TAT protein associating with both P-TEFb and TAR . JMJD6 is one of the most controversial proteins in biology ( Vangimalla et al . , 2017 ) . It was first cloned as phosphatidylserine ( PS ) receptor ( Fadok et al . , 2000 ) , but was corrected as a nucleus expressed protein unrelated to PS ( Böse et al . , 2004; Cikala et al . , 2004; Cui et al . , 2004 ) . It was later reported to contain arginine demethylase activity on histone tails ( Chang et al . , 2007 ) , hydroxylase activity on splicing factor U2AF65 ( Webby et al . , 2009 ) and histone tails ( Han et al . , 2012 ) , and both arginine demethylase activities on histone tails and RNA demethylase activities on 5’ prime of 7SK snRNA ( Liu et al . , 2013 ) , and surprisingly PS binding ( Neumann et al . , 2015; Yang et al . , 2015 ) . The exact or cognate substrate ( s ) of JMJD6 remains unresolved or controversial . Based on the novel protease activities of JMJD5 and JMJD7 ( Liu et al . , 2017; Shen et al . , 2017; Liu et al . , 2018 ) , the high structural similarity among catalytic cores of JMJD5 , JMJD6 , and JMJD7 ( Hong et al . , 2010; Liu et al . , 2018 ) , and analogous severe phenotypes among knockouts of Jmjd5 and Jmjd6 in mice ( Li et al . , 2003; Böse et al . , 2004; Ishimura et al . , 2012; Oh and Janknecht , 2012 ) , we hypothesized that JMJD6 may contain protease activity working on methylated arginines on some protein candidates which regulate the activity of Pol II , especially promoter-proximally paused Pol II . It is well established that the 7SK snRNP complex primarily functions to sequester the CDK9-containing P-TEFb until stimulation ( Jang et al . , 2005; Yang et al . , 2005 ) . MePCE ( methylphosphate capping enzyme ) was first characterized as a component of the 7SK snRNP complex which acts as a capping enzyme on the gamma phosphate at the 5’end of 7SK RNA ( Jeronimo et al . , 2007 ) . Furthermore , a capping-independent function of MePCE via stabilization of 7SK snRNA and facilitation in the assembly of 7SK snRNP was reported by Dr . Qiang Zhou’s group ( Xue et al . , 2010 ) . Knockdown of MePCE led to destabilization of the 7SK snRNP complex in vivo ( Xue et al . , 2010; Singh et al . , 2011; C Quaresma et al . , 2016 ) . A nonsense variant of MePCE is reported to be associated with a neurodevelopmental disorder exhibiting hyperphosphorylation of Pol II , potentially caused by enhanced activation of CDK9 complex ( Schneeberger et al . , 2019 ) . Interestingly , one report showed that MePCE may also work in an 7SK snRNP independent manner to recruit CDK9 on a small group of genes ( Shelton et al . , 2018 ) . In this report , we reveal that MePCE of the 7SK snRNP complex is a cognate substrate of JMJD6 . 2 Results Based on these divergent reports regarding substrates of JMJD6 ( Chang et al . , 2007; Webby et al . , 2009; Han et al . , 2012; Liu et al . , 2013; Neumann et al . , 2015 ) , we re-interrogated proposed substrates using stringent and unified criteria . As we reported previously , JMJD6 binds with high binding affinity ( ~40 nM ) to single stranded RNA ( ssRNA ) without sequence specificity ( Hong et al . , 2010 ) . However , truncation analysis showed that JMJD6 barely binds to ssRNA without the C-terminal flexible region ( Hong et al . , 2010 ) . This suggests that the C-terminal domain of JMJD6 may just serve as ssRNA binding motif and RNAs are not a substrate for the enzymatic activity of JMJD6 . On the other hand , the structure of the catalytic core of JMJD6 shows some critical similarity to those of JMJD5 and JMJD7 , with a negatively charged microenvironment near the catalytic center ( Hong et al . , 2010; Liu et al . , 2018 ) , suggesting positively charged substrates ( Figure 1 ) . As we reported , JMJD5 and JMJD7 specifically recognize methylarginines of histone tails via a Tudor-domain-like structure near the catalytic center of JMJD5 , which could specifically recognize methylarginines , but not methyllysine ( Liu et al . , 2017; Liu et al . , 2018 ) . We reasoned that the similar structural features among JMJD6 , JMJD5 , and JMJD7 may confer a similar substrate for JMJD6 as those of JMJD5 and JMJD7 . In this regard , crystals of JMJD6 without C-terminal motif ( 1-343 ) were soaked with a monomethylarginine derivative . Interestingly , four out of eight JMJD6 molecules within an asymmetric unit bound to monomethylarginine , which coordinates with Fe2+ and alpha-KG in the catalytic center similar to that of JMJD5 and methylarginines ( Figure 1 , Figure 1—figure supplements 1–3 , Supplementary file 1 ) . However , the methylated sidechain of arginine is located in a more open catalytic space containing negatively charged residues , compared to that of JMJD5 , indicating that the pocket could hold more than one sidechain ( Figure 1A ) . This may suggest a novel substrate recognition mode , which is different from that of JMJD5 ( Liu et al . , 2018 ) . Nevertheless , the complex structure shows several key evidences . First , JMJD6 does bind to substrates with methylarginine or possibly methyllysine or both arginine and lysine with and without methylation ( Figure 1B , C ) . Second , the methyl group is far away from either the divalent ion or alpha-KG , suggesting JMJD6 may not act as lysine or arginine demethylases to remove methyl groups on the sidechain of either lysine or arginine . Third , peptides or proteins could be cognate substrates instead of RNA or DNA , which do not contain any positive charge with or without methylation . Fourth , the catalytic center contains analogous residues present in JMJD5 and JMJD7 , suggesting a similar novel catalytic mechanism as those of JMJD5 and JMJD7 through an imidic acid as proton mediator ( Figure 1D; Lee et al . , 2017; Liu et al . , 2018 ) . This novelty is particularly exemplified by the fact that commercially available protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) at 2x concentration cannot inhibit activities of JMJD5 , JMJD6 , and JMJD7 . Furthermore , a comprehensive protein composition analysis using mass spectrometry ( Supplementary file 2 ) of all purified recombinant JMJD6 samples used in the following experiments could not detect any protease contaminants . Since JMJD5 and JMJD7 make cleavage on histone tails ( Liu et al . , 2017 ) , we asked whether JMJD6 also recognizes histone tails . Interestingly , JMJD6 does in fact have activities on bulk histone in vitro ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1A ) . This result may explain why two groups found that JMJD6 could reduce methylarginine containing histone tails in in vitro assays probed with antibodies ( Chang et al . , 2007; Liu et al . , 2013 ) , in which post-cleft short peptides with methylarginines cannot be recognized by antibodies in western blots . To confirm or rule out whether histone tails are cognate substrates of JMJD6 , we first assessed the binding affinity between JMJD6 and histone peptides with or without arginine methylation . From fluorescence polarization binding assays , binding affinities between JMJD6 and peptides are weak and around ~150 μM ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1D , E ) . Most importantly , with or without Jmjd6 , the level of arginine methylated histones or overall histone levels does not change in MEF cells in vivo ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1B ) , which is in stark contrast to those of JMJD5 and JMJD7 ( Liu et al . , 2017 ) . These data suggest that histone tails are not cognate substrates of JMJD6 . Parenthetically , it is reported that JMJD6 binds to LARP7 on 7SK snRNP ( Weimann et al . , 2013 ) , works on methyl cap of 5’ 7SK snRNA ( Liu et al . , 2013 ) , and binds to BRD4 ( Rahman et al . , 2011; Konuma et al . , 2017 ) , all suggesting a close relation with the 7SK snRNP complex . We hypothesized that JMJD6 may work on some protein component ( s ) of the 7SK snRNP to regulate the stability of 7SK snRNP complex . Interestingly , all protein components of the 7SK snRNP complex including MEPCE , LARP7 , and HEXIM1 are drastically decreased in the MEF cells without Jmjd6 ( Figure 2A ) . One possibility is that all members are transcriptionally regulated by JMJD6 . This could be consistent with the severe phenotype of Jmjd6 knockouts , which results in neonatal lethality and cell growth retardation and tissue differentiation ( Li et al . , 2003; Böse et al . , 2004 ) , suggesting that JMJD6 is a global master transcriptional regulator controlling expression of a large group of genes including components from the 7SK snRNP complex . However , our RNA-Seq data does not support direct transcriptional downregulation of 7SK snRNP complex members at mRNA level ( Supplementary file 3 ) . All of them , including MePCE , LARP7 , and HEXIM1 have similar mRNA levels with or without Jmjd6 . At the moment , the cause of this downregulation of proteins level of these components from 7SK snRNP remains unresolved and is beyond the scope of this report . However , when we introduce back JMJD6 via overexpression into MEF cells lacking Jmjd6 , protein levels of LARP7 and HEXIM1 are rescued , whereas MePCE is undetectable ( Figure 2A ) or significantly reduced ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1C ) . To account for this disappearance of MePCE , we hypothesized that overexpression of JMJD6 may directly target MEPCE for degradation . To confirm this hypothesis , we respectively overexpressed full-length MePCE in wild-type MEF , Jmjd6 knockout MEF , wild-type JMJD6 overexpression in Jmjd6 knockout MEF , and inactive mutant JMJD6 overexpression in Jmjd6 knockout MEF . The whole cell lysates were probed with anti-MePCE antibody . Our hypothesis was vindicated with the emergence of a lower molecular weight form of MePCE in wild-type MEF and wild-type JMJD6 overexpression in Jmjd6 knockout MEF , whereas the lower molecular weight form of MePCE was not detectable in the Jmjd6 knockout MEF , and inactive mutant JMJD6 overexpression in Jmjd6 knockout MEF ( Figure 2B ) . To reproduce these in vivo results in an in vitro setting , full-length proteins linked with N-terminal His6-tag of MePCE and HEXIM1 were generated from insect cells and LARP7 and HEXIM2 were generated from bacteria and purified , followed by subjecting these proteins to direct in vitro enzymatic assays . Consistent with our in vivo results , JMJD6 cleaves MePCE in vitro ( Figure 2C , D ) , but not HEXIM1 , HEXIM2 , nor LARP7 ( data not shown ) . Upon cleavage of MePCE by JMJD6 in vitro , a band with molecular weight ~25 kDa was detected by antibody against His6-tag at the N-terminal ( Figure 2C ) . To provide context , MePCE contains a total of 689 residues and a theoretical molecular weight of 74 . 4 kDa , whereas it is detected at ~90 kDa on SDS-PAGE gel due to its high content of proline residues ( 10 . 7% ) . We expect that the ~25 kDa fragment from N-terminal of MePCE may contain 200 residues or less due to rich proline residues within the N-terminal of MePCE ( first 150 residues of MePCE contains 27 prolines , 18 . 0% prolines ) . Furthermore , our in vivo assay yielded a cleaved MePCE band with a molecular weight ~65 kDa ( Figure 2B ) . The anti-MePCE antibody used in this assay was generated using a peptide immunogen containing residues 200–250 of MePCE . Thus , the ~65 kDa band may correspond to the cleaved C-terminal segment of MePCE containing the approximate residues 200–689 . Based on the binding of JMJD6 to methylated arginine we obtained from the complex crystal structure , we reasoned that arginine residues within approximately the first 200 residues of MePCE could contain the recognition site . Several peptide fragments including residues from 81 to 160 , residues 154 to 184 , and residues 187 to 244 were synthesized . Peptides of 81–160 and 187–244 did not show any cleavage when incubated with JMJD6 . Peptides of 154–184 showed cleavage activity , but at levels of <1% compared to peptide input . We attributed this low activity as a matter of insolubility and dimerization via C177 oxidation . To overcome this obstacle , a shorter peptide from residue 161 to 179 containing C177S was synthesized and subjected to enzymatic reaction under JMJD6 . This peptide also contains symmetric dimethylation on R171 , given that our binding data , described in the next section , suggests that this particular modification yields the highest binding affinity ( Figure 3C ) . In line with our expectations , dominant peaks corresponding to the cleaved MePCE peptide products were detected by mass spectrometry , but not in either peptide alone or with an inactive mutant version of JMJD6 ( Figure 2E ) . To determine the binding affinity between JMJD6 and the newly discerned MePCE proteolysis site , Microscale Thermophoresis ( MST ) assay was performed using catalytic core of JMJD6 ( 1–343 ) titrated with the MePCE ( 154-184 ) peptide exhibiting: no modification ( Figure 3A ) , R170-me2s ( Figure 3B ) , or R171-me2s ( Figure 3C ) . The highest binding affinity was exhibited by the MePCE ( 154-184 ) -R171-me2s peptide with Kd = 159 ± 77 nM , followed by the peptide containing no modification with Kd = 471 ± 292 nM , and lastly the peptide with R170-me2s with Kd = 568 ± 316 nM . Fluorescence polarization assays were used to cross-validate the Kd values obtained via MST above , all of which respectively fell within the margin of error ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1A , B , C ) . These data suggest that methylation on R171 enhances binding nearly 3-fold compared to no modification , whereas methylation on R170 diminishes binding marginally . Whether or not these particular methylations occur in vivo is yet to be explored . Interestingly , the YASARA Energy Minimization Server developed by Dr . Kevin Karplus’ group yielded a theoretical model that positions R171 in the identical position to the monomethyl-arginine observed in our crystal model ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2A; Krieger et al . , 2009 ) . Furthermore , the energy-minimized model displayed eight separate charge-charge interactions between JMJD6 and MePCE ( Figure 3G ) . Although a bona fide complex structure is preferred , this computational model is in excellent agreement with all our findings and provides a coherent justification for the experimentally observed high binding affinities between JMJD6 and MePCE . To compare the abovementioned binding affinities to that of JMJD6 and histone tails , as other groups have previously purported , the identical MST assay was performed using peptides derived from Histone 3 ( 1-21 ) containing no modification ( H3 ) ( Figure 3D ) , Histone 3 ( 1-16 ) -R2-me2s ( H3R2me2s ) ( Figure 3E ) , and C-peptide ( 57-87 ) as a negative control ( Figure 3F ) . For the Histone three peptides , low binding affinity was exhibited with Kd = 77 ± 34 μM for H3 peptide and Kd = 98 ± 14 μM for H3R2me2s peptide . No meaningful binding was observed for the C-peptide ( Figure 3F ) . To verify the authenticity of the above model and confirm our proposed cleavage site of JMJD6 within MePCE , we generated an MePCE knockout 293 T cell line ( Figure 3H ) and respectively overexpressed C-terminal His6-tagged wild-type MePCE or C-terminal His6-tagged mutant MePCE , which replaced -RRRR- to -AAAA- at the cleavage site . Interestingly , when probed with anti-His6 antibody in a western blot , wild-type MePCE generates two bands of MePCE ( Figure 3I , left lane ) , consistent with Figure 2B , whereas the mutant version does not ( Figure 3I , right lane ) , suggesting that this site is the authentic cleavage site for JMJD6 . To further confirm these results , we introduced the two variants of MePCE back to the JMJD6 overexpressing MEF cell line in jmjd6 knockout background . Once again consistent with Figure 2B , two major bands show up with the wild-type MePCE ( Figure 3J , left lane ) , whereas only one major band and one faint band show up with the mutant MePCE ( Figure 3J , right lane ) . This data provides another solid evidence of the cleavage site within MePCE by JMJD6 . To further verify our proposed role of JMJD6 on MePCE , the mutant MePCE containing N-terminal His6-tagged was expressed in insect cells and purified for an in vitro assay . The native form of MePCE generates a small band ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2B ) , consistent with Figure 2C , whereas the mutant MePCE does not generate any additional band ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2C ) . Taken together , we propose that JMJD6 is the cognate protease of MePCE and cleaves at the R171 site within MePCE . We previously reported that cleavage of histone tails by JMJD5 and JMJD7 could lead to tailless nucleosomes , which are unstable and are more readily overcome by Pol II during transcription ( Liu et al . , 2017; Liu et al . , 2018 ) . What happens when MePCE is cleaved ? Does MePCE cleavage mediate P-TEFb to be released from the 7SK snRNP complex , allowing P-TEFb to be recruited to CTD of Pol II , and then to phosphorylate Ser2-CTD of Pol II ? Nuclear extracts from both wild-type MEFs , Jmjd6 knockout MEFs and JMJD6 overexpression in Jmjd6-deficient MEFs were subjected to investigation as to the level of Ser2p-CTD of Pol II . Consistent with all our current and previous findings , Ser2p-CTD of Pol II is drastically reduced ( ~80% ) in MEF cells without Jmjd6 , despite CDK9 levels remaining unchanged , suggesting that Ser2p-CTD of Pol II is regulated by JMJD6 ( Figure 4A , B ) . A question raised here is whether the drop of active Pol II ( Ser2p-CTD ) is related to the protease activity of JMJD6 toward the CDK9-sequestering role of MePCE . Therefore , the MePCE knockout cell line was investigated for its effect on Pol II . To our great satisfaction , Pol II Ser2p-CTD is dramatically increased in 293 T cells with MePCE knockout ( Figure 4C , right lane ) compared to the wild-type ( Figure 4C , left lane ) . Of interest , Shelton et al . ( 2018 ) showed that CDK9 interacts with the N-terminal region of MePCE ( 1-400 ) ) . We found a very similar JMJD6 cutting site around residues 363–367 ( -RKRRR- ) compared the site we characterized around residues 167–172 ( -KRRRR- ) . If JMJD6 also cuts this site as well , it seems that MePCE may act as an anchor site for CDK9 on 7SK snRNP complex . It is an interesting topic that requires further investigation . The totality of our results is consistent with the critical role of JMJD6 in embryonic development , which is neonatal lethal without Jmjd6 ( Li et al . , 2003; Böse et al . , 2004 ) . It explains why growth of MEF cells without Jmjd6 is severely compromised , similar to those without either Jmjd5 or Jmjd7 ( Liu et al . , 2017 ) . This data suggests not only that JMJD6’s cleavage of MePCE is essential for P-TEFb to be released from the 7SK snRNP complex and ultimately the phosphorylation of Ser2-CTD of Pol II , but also further cross-confirms that a species of Ser2p-CTD of Pol II is indeed generated by CDK9 . The content of Ser2p-CTD of Pol II is recovered when JMJD6 is re-expressed ( Figure 4A , B ) , suggesting the direct relation of JMJD6 and phosphorylation of Ser2-CTD of Pol II in vivo . When these results are aggregated with previously published reports , whereby ( 1 ) JMJD6 exhibits strong binding affinity to nonspecific ssRNA as we previously reported ( Figure 4D; Hong et al . , 2010 ) , ( 2 ) JMJD6 associates with BRD4 as reported by others ( Figure 4D; Rahman et al . , 2011; Konuma et al . , 2017 ) , and ( 3 ) JMJD6 digests MePCE so as to disrupt the overall stability of 7SK snRNP complex as highlighted in this report ( Figure 4D ) , a model of P-TEFb transcription regulation unique to higher eukaryotes can be generated: JMJD6 binds to 20–50 nt newly transcribed 5’ prime end of ssRNAs of initiated Pol II of any stimulating genes . The association between BRD4 and JMJD6 allows BRD4 to bring P-TEFb ( CDK9 ) to close proximity of CTD of Pol II , allowing for Ser2-CTD phosphorylation ( Figure 4E ) . Remarkably , this recruitment of P-TEFb by JMJD6 , with the assistance of BRD4 , is similar to that of TAT protein hijacking P-TEFb complex after associating with TAR transcript to trigger the expression of HIV retroviral genome ( Figure 4F; Peterlin et al . , 2012; Zhou et al . , 2012; C Quaresma et al . , 2016 ) . Here , our observation regarding the direct relation of JMJD6 and level of Ser2p-CTD of Pol II in vivo is corroborated by Liu et al . ’s report , in which 7SK snRNP complex pulled-down through HEXIM1 antibody from HEK293 cells could be disrupted by JMJD6 in vitro , as indicated by the decrease in CDK9 levels ( Liu et al . , 2013 ) , thus strongly supporting our proposed role of JMJD6 as a direct disruptor of the 7SK snRNP complex . 3 Discussion It took us nearly two decades to address the structure and function of JMJD6 since it was first cloned ( Fadok et al . , 2000 ) . During the long journey , based on the conserved structure of JmjC domain containing family , we pioneered in characterizing the catalytic core of JMJD2 subfamily , which turned out to be a novel lysine demethylase ( Chen et al . , 2006; Whetstine et al . , 2006; Chen et al . , 2007 ) . We then solved the structure of JMJD6 with the help of a monoclonal antibody and discovered its unique ssRNA binding property almost a decade ago ( Hong et al . , 2010 ) . However , the exact function and its cognate substrate remained a mystery , though several groups claimed variety of enzymatic activities and substrates in past two decades ( Chang et al . , 2007; Webby et al . , 2009; Han et al . , 2012; Liu et al . , 2013 ) . The accidental discoveries of novel protease activities of JMJD5 and JMJD7 by our group prompted the exploration of potential protease activity of JMJD6 ( Liu et al . , 2017; Liu et al . , 2018 ) . The report by Liu et al . ( 2013 ) helped us to narrow down the potential cognate substrate within the 7SK snRNP complex . Reports of arginine demethylase activity ( Chang et al . , 2007; Liu et al . , 2013 ) helped us to focus on methylated arginine as the potential cleavage sites . Thanks to these reports , we identified MePCE to be the cognate substrate of JMJD6 , as well as the potential cleavage site . Numerous lines of evidence from our current discoveries and other publications corroborates the authenticity of this conclusion: First , JMJD6 is specifically associated with BRD4 through the ET domain ( Rahman et al . , 2011; Konuma et al . , 2017 ) , while BRD4 is very well established to recruit P-TEFb to paused Pol II ( Yang et al . , 2005; Yang et al . , 2008 ) . Second , JMJD6 could disrupt the 7SK snRNP complex in vitro as reported by Liu et al . ( 2013 ) . Third , our current discoveries showed that JMJD6 cleaves MePCE of the 7SK snRNP complex . Fourth , our previous discovery of JMJD6’s interaction with non-specific ssRNA bridges JMJD6 to the initiated Pol II which generates 20–50 nt long ssRNA ( Hong et al . , 2010 ) . The findings that JMJD5 and JMJD7 are in fact proteases was highly unexpected , and required multiple lines of evidence pursued with great scrutiny . It is quite extraordinary that a very conserved Jumonji domain containing hydroxylase family should contain a subfamily which evolutionarily adopted distinctive protease activities , as well as exhibit several unexpected novelties including the catalysis mechanism involving imidic acid and both endopeptidase and exopeptidase activities ( Liu et al . , 2017; Liu et al . , 2018 ) . Indeed , recombinant proteins derived from bacteria have a high chance of contamination by bacterial proteases , although we exhausted innumerable means to exclude the possibility of contamination in our assays ( Liu et al . , 2017; Liu et al . , 2018 ) . In this report , the novel protease activity of JMJD6 , which cleaves before the methylated arginine , is remarkably distinct to the cleavage after the methylated arginine mediated by JMJD5 and JMJD7 ( Liu et al . , 2017; Liu et al . , 2018 ) . This important piece of evidence supports the claim of JMJD5 and JMJD7 as proteases . It is highly improbable that one batch of proteins we purified was contaminated by one type of undiscovered protease ( s ) ( cleavage after methylated arginine for JMJD5 and JMJD7 ) while another batch of proteins was contaminated by a different type of undiscovered protease ( s ) ( cleavage before methylated arginine for JMJD6 ) , all which respectively have substrate specificity matching the expected biological profiles of JMJD5/6/7 . Based on our current discoveries , we may derive a novel transcription regulation pathway for genes regulated by promoter-proximal pausing Pol II . First , upon stimulation of cells , signals will reach specific transcription factors through signal transduction pathways . With modification or with the help of other partner molecules , these transcription factors bind to enhancers close to the paused Pol II . These transcription factors will recruit P300/CBP with the help of H3K4 ( me1 ) at enhancer regions , which in turn acetylates H3 and/or H4 on the same nucleosome bound by P300/CBP through association with H3K4 ( me1 ) to generate acetylated H3 and/or H4 ( Figure 5A ) . Next , BRD4 is recruited to acetylated H3 and/or H4 , and in turn engages with JMJD6 and the initiated Pol II complex . JMJD6 specifically cleaves MePCE of the 7SK snRNP complex so as to release the P-TEFb complex containing CDK9 ( Figure 5B ) . Finally , JMJD6 and BRD4 brings P-TEFb to close proximity of CTD of Pol II through super elongation complex . P-TEFb ( CDK9 ) then phosphorylates Ser2-CTD of Pol II ( Figure 5C ) . 4 Materials and methods The cDNA corresponding to gene of wild-type JMJD6 ( 1–343 ) , inactive mutant JMJD6 ( 1–343 ) H187A/D189A/H273A/K204A/N287A , HEXIM2 , and LARP7 was cloned into a pET28a vector containing an N-terminal His6 tag . The DNA corresponding to gene of JMJD6 ( 1–403 ) wild-type was cloned into a pGEX vector containing an N-terminal GST tag and TEV linker . All proteins were expressed in Rosetta ( DE3 ) Escherichia coli cells . All cell cultures were grown to A600 value equal to about 1 . 0 and induced with a final concentration of 1 . 0 mM isopropyl 1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside overnight at 16°C . Cells were resuspended in nickel-binding buffer ( 50 mM Tris-HCl , pH8 . 0 , 1M NaCl , 1 mM PMSF ) and lysed using a sonicator ( Fisher Scientific Sonic Dismembrator Model 500 ) at 35% power , 10 s ON , 5 s OFF , for 20 min . The lysate was centrifuged at 16 , 000 rpm at 4°C for 30 min . The supernatant corresponding to His-JMJD6 ( 1–343 ) was loaded to 7 mL of Ni-NTA resin ( GE Healthcare ) , washed with nickel-binding buffer containing 20 mM imidazole , and eluted with nickel-binding buffer containing 500 mM imidazole . The supernatant corresponding to GST-tev-JMJD6 ( 1–403 ) was loaded to 7 mL of glutathione agarose resin ( Thermo Scientific ) , washed with nickel-binding buffer , and eluted with nickel-binding buffer containing 30 mM glutathione . All eluted JMJD6 products were concentrated and purified on a superdex 200 10/300 GL column ( GE Healthcare ) previously equilibrated with nickel-binding buffer containing 15 mM β-mercaptoethanol . The cDNA fragment encoding full-length wild-type MePCE with an N-terminal His6-tag , full-length mutant MePCE ( R169D/R170N/R171D/R172N ) with an N-terminal His6-tag , and HEXIM1 with an N-terminal His6-tag was cloned under control of the polyhedrin promoter into a previously described baculovirus transfer plasmid ( Kozono et al . , 1994 ) . Recombinant virus was made by co-transfection into SF9 insect cells ( Invitrogen ) of the plasmid and BacVector3000 baculovirus DNA ( Novagen ) using the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method . High titer virus stock was prepared by infection of SF9 insect cells . Wild-type MePCE , mutant MePCE , and HEXIM1 protein was produced by infection of High Five insect cells ( Invitrogen ) at high multiplicity of infection . Four days later , the cells were lysed by sonication in nickel-binding buffer . Lysates were cleared by centrifugation ( 20 , 000 rpm , 60 min ) and proteins were purified from the supernatant using 7 mL of Ni-NTA resin ( GE Healthcare ) . The protein was eluted from the column with nickel-binding buffer containing 500 mM imidazole . His-JMJD6 ( 1–343 ) was crystallized by vapor diffusion in sitting drops with 0 . 1M sodium citrate pH 5 . 6 , 1 . 0M ammonium phosphate monobasic at 8°C . The crystals were soaked in soaking buffer; 0 . 1M sodium citrate pH 5 . 6 , 1 . 0M ammonium phosphate monobasic , 10 mM mono-methyl arginine , 3 . 75 mM αKG , 3 . 75 mM Iron ( II ) sulfate . For data collection , His-JMJD6 ( 1–343 ) crystals were transferred to a cryo-protecting buffer ( soaking buffer supplemented with 25% glycerol ( v/v ) ) and frozen in liquid nitrogen . All data used in structure solving and refinement were collected on a beam line 4 . 2 . 2 ( MBC-ALS ) at the Advanced Light Source ( Berkeley , ALS , USA ) . Data were integrated and scaled using the HKL2000 suite of programs . Structural determination and refinement results are shown in Supplementary file 1 . To analyze protein levels , wild-type MEF , Jmjd6 knockout ( KO ) MEF , wild-type JMJD6 overexpression in Jmjd6 KO MEF , inactive mutant JMJD6 overexpression in Jmjd6 KO MEF , wild-type MePCE overexpression in above four MEF cell lines , mutant MePCE ( R169A/R170A/R171A/R172A ) overexpression in wild-type JMJD6 overexpression in Jmjd6 KO MEF , wild-type MePCE with a C-terminal His6 tag overexpression in MePCE KO 293T , and mutant MePCE ( R169A/R170A/R171A/R172A ) with a C-terminal His6 tag overexpression in MePCE KO 293 T cells were grown on 10 cm plates to be harvested and lysed using a standard RIPA buffer mixed with cOmplete Protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) . MEFs were generated from Jmjd6tm1 . 1Gbf knockout mice as previously described ( Böse et al . , 2004; Hahn et al . , 2010 ) . Total cellular extracts in the presence of a protein standard ( Bio-rad ) were resolved by 8–12% gradient SDS-PAGE and transferred to a 0 . 22 μm nitrocellulose membrane and incubated with specific antibodies overnight at 4°C . Antibodies used in this investigation were: Anti-JMJD6 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , sc-28348 ) , Anti-LARP7 ( Abcam , ab-134757 ) , Anti-HEXIM1 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , sc-390059 ) , Anti-MePCE ( Bethyl Laboratories Inc , A304-184A ) , Anti-Actin ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , sc-8432 ) , Anti-His ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , sc-53073 ) , Anti-Pol II CTD ( Gift from Dr . David Bentley ) , Anti-Pol II Ser2p-CTD ( Gift from Dr . David Bentley ) , and Anti-CDK9 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-13130 ) . Full-length MePCE protein with N-terminal His-tag , mixed with EDTA-free cOmplete protease inhibitor ( Roche ) , αKG , Zn2+ , and HEPES pH 6 . 5 , was titrated with recombinant wild-type JMJD6 and placed in 37°C for 2 hr . The reaction was subject to western blot analysis using monoclonal anti-His antibody ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , sc-53073 ) . The reaction was reproduced in two separate experiments and the blot bands were quantified using ImageJ . MePCE ( 161-179 ) R171-me2s/C177S peptide , mixed with EDTA-free cOmplete protease inhibitor ( Roche ) , αKG , Zn2+ , and HEPES pH 6 . 5 , was treated with recombinant wild-type JMJD6 , inactive mutant JMJD6 , or peptide alone and placed in 37°C for 2 hr . 1 μL of reaction sample is mixed with 1 μL of a-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid ( 10 mg/ml in 50% ACN , 0 . 1% TFA ) . The mixture is spotted on the MALDI target and allowed to air dry . The sample is analyzed by a Microflex-LRF mass spectrometer ( Bruker Daltonics , Billerica , MA ) in positive ion reflector mode . External calibration is done using a peptide calibration mixture ( 4 to 6 peptides ) on a spot adjacent to the sample . The raw data is processed in the FlexAnalysis software ( version 3 . 4 . 7 , Bruker Daltonics ) and exported in mzXML format . The mzXML files were analyzed on ProteoWizard . Data points were normalized to the intensity of the undigested peptide input and plotted on SigmaPlot v11 . 0 . The reaction was reproduced in three separate experiments . Given the known structure of JMJD6 , where aromatic residues are present in close proximity to the binding pocket ( Y131 , F133 , W174 , W272 ) , the following tryptophan fluorescence assay was deemed suitable for characterizing various peptide binding activity . All the regular and methylated peptides were synthesized by AnaSpec Inc ( Histone 3 ) or Peptide 2 . 0 Inc ( MePCE ) . 5 μM JMJD6 ( 1–343 ) was titrated and equilibrated with fixed concentrations of each peptide respectively , incubated at 25°C for 30 min between each titration intervals , and subject to fluorescence measurement . The buffer used in the fluorescence quenching assay was 100 mM NaCl , 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 6 . 5 , and 0 . 05% Tween-20 . The excitation wavelength of 280 nm and the emission wavelength of 342 nm was used for data collection and recorded with a Fluoromax-3 spectrometer . The titration samples were prepared and analyzed in parallel as duplicates , triplicates , or quadruplicates . All values at different titration points were compiled , normalized against the maximum value obtained prior to titration and averaged . The error bars indicate the normalized minimum and maximum values at any given titration point . The KD for each peptide was calculated by fitting to a four parameter sigmoidal dose-response curve with SigmaPlot v11 . 0 . His-JMJD6 ( 1–343 ) labeled with fluorescent NT-647 dye at a constant concentration of 100 nM was mixed with sixteen serial dilutions ( ~1 . 5 nM–300 μM ) of peptides derived from MePCE ( 154-187 ) , MePCE ( 154-184 ) R170-me2s , MePCE ( 154-184 ) R171-me2s , Histone 3 ( 1-21 ) , Histone 3 ( 1-16 ) R2me2s , C-peptide ( 57-87 ) . C-Peptide ( 57-87 ) was used as a negative control . MST experiment was performed using Monolith NT . 115 ( NanoTemper Technologies ) . His-JMJD6 ( 1–343 ) was titrated with peptides in PBS-T buffer ( 137 mM NaCl , 2 . 7 mM KCl , 10 mM Na2HPO4 , 1 . 8 mM KH2PO4 , and 0 . 05% Tween-20 ) . The change in the fluorescence of bound and unbound labeled His-JMJD6 ( 1–343 ) , ΔF , is indicative of the peptide binding . Plotting ΔF vs . peptide concentration facilitated the generation the dissociation curves , computed by the NTP program . The KD , reflecting the affinity of each of the peptides for His-JMJD6 ( 1–343 ) , was obtained . The error bars indicate the normalized minimum and maximum values at any given titration point . Each experiment was performed in triplicate or quadruplicate . Crystal structure of JMJD6 ( 1–343 ) monomer ( PDB:6MEV ) sans methylarginine was used as the template to build in residues corresponding to MePCE ( 164-178 ) near the catalytic center of JMJD6 in PyMol . No regard for clashes , bonds , or optimization was considered . Structure was exported in . pdb format and uploaded to YASARA energy minimization server ( http://www . yasara . org/minimizationserver . htm ) using default parameters ( Krieger et al . , 2009 ) . Energy-minimized output model was converted to . pdb format and the MePCE ( 164-178 ) residues were minimally adjusted in PyMol to superimpose R171 of MePCE with the methylarginine observed in the crystal structure ( PDB:6MEV ) . Western blot of Pol II Ser2p-CTD and unmodified Pol II CTD in wild-type MEF , Jmjd6 knockout ( KO ) MEF , or wild-type JMJD6 overexpression in Jmjd6 KO MEF was reproduced in four separate experiments . All blot bands were quantified using ImageJ and the band intensity of Pol II Ser2p-CTD was normalized against the band intensity of unmodified Pol II CTD in each respective cell lines . The band intensity of each replicate was normalized against the Pol II Ser2p-CTD level in wild-type MEF , then averaged . The error bars indicate one standard deviation to the observed mean . The P-value was obtained using a paired t-test . RNAs from wild type MEF cells , MEF cells with Jmjd6 knockout , and MEF cells with JMJD6 overexpression cells in Jmjd6 knockout background , respectively , were extracted with Trizol reagent ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) . The extracted RNAs were then sent to Quick biology ( Quick Biology , Pasadena ) for further mRNA purification using oligo-d ( T ) beads . The purified mRNA was then used to build a mRNA library . Mouse Genome mm10 was used as the reference ."}

Myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) is a common type of blood cancer in the elderly that occurs when blood cells fail to develop normally . Depending on which types of blood cells are affected , individuals with MDS may bleed more easily , feel weak and tired , or be unable to effectively fight off infections . Animals and plants store their genetic information in the form of chromosomes . Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes , with one copy inherited from the mother , and the other from the father . The bone marrow cells of many people with MDS delete a section from one of their copies of chromosome 7 . As this section contains many different genes , it is difficult to fully understand which specific genes contribute to the development of MDS when one copy is lost . Wong et al . have now genetically engineered mice to lack a section of one of their copies of chromosome 7 that is often missing in patients with MDS . Bone marrow cells from these mice exhibit many of the same abnormalities found in human MDS . For example , most of the immature blood stem cells expand , but these stem cells do not correctly specialize into mature blood cells—in particular , not enough immune cells are produced . The developing blood cells also have problems expressing several genes , including one that helps to protect the cells from damaging molecules called reactive oxygen species . These problems worsen as the mice age . These mice provide the first evidence directly linking the missing section of chromosome 7 to abnormalities found in MDS patients . Future studies using the mice will advance our understanding of how the loss of this section of chromosome 7 interacts with other genes involved in MDS to alter the course of this disease and how it responds to treatment .", "article": "1 Introduction The myelodysplastic syndromes ( MDSs ) are clonal stem cell disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis , morphologic dysplasia , and a variable risk of progression to acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) ( Elias et al . , 2014 ) . Monosomy 7 ( −7 ) and deletions affecting the long arm of chromosome 7 [del ( 7q ) ] are highly prevalent acquired cytogenetic abnormalities in de novo and in therapy-related MDS and AML ( t-MDS/t-AML ) ( Smith et al . , 2003 ) . The proportion of −7/del ( 7q ) cells is markedly increased in the hematopoietic stem cell ( HSC ) and progenitor compartments of MDS patients relative to T and B lymphocytes ( Kere et al . , 1987b; Abrahamson et al . , 1991; Bernell et al . , 1996; Will et al . , 2012; Elias et al . , 2014 ) . Recent studies demonstrating quantitative changes in the frequencies of phenotypic primitive long-term HSCs , common myeloid progenitors ( CMPs ) , and granulocyte-monocyte progenitors ( GMPs ) in MDS patients with −7/del ( 7q ) further support diverse effects on hematopoiesis ( Will et al . , 2012; Pang et al . , 2013 ) . Multiple studies of MDS and AML specimens with interstitial deletions on 7q have implicated three putative commonly deleted segments ( CDSs ) at chromosome bands 7q22 , 7q34 , and 7q35-36 ( Figure 1A ) ( Kere et al . , 1987a; Le Beau et al . , 1996; Fischer et al . , 1997; Liang et al . , 1998; Tosi et al . , 1999; Jerez et al . , 2012; McNerney et al . , 2013; Hosono et al . , 2014 ) . Of these intervals , 7q22 is deleted most frequently in cases of MDS or AML with a del ( 7q ) ( Le Beau et al . , 1996 ) . Targeted sequencing of candidate myeloid tumor suppressor genes ( TSGs ) located within a 2 . 5 Mb 7q22 CDS delineated by Le Beau et al . ( 1996 ) , and recent comprehensive genomic analyses of clinical specimens strongly implicate a haploinsufficient role of 7q22 deletions in leukemogenesis ( Kere et al . , 1989; Fischer et al . , 1997; Liang et al . , 1998; Tosi et al . , 1999; Ebert , 2011; Jerez et al . , 2012; McNerney et al . , 2013; Hosono et al . , 2014 ) . Consistent with this proposed mechanism , biallelic inactivation of any 7q gene is rare in MDS patients with −7/del ( 7q ) . For example , whole exome sequencing of 68 myeloid malignancies characterized by −7/del ( 7q ) uncovered recurrent mutations in only EZH2 ( located at 7q36; n = 4 ) and LUC7L2 ( at 7q34; n = 3 ) . Biallelic inactivation of these genes and of CUX1 ( located at 7q22 ) was observed in a small cohort of patients with 7q isodisomy ( Hosono et al . , 2014 ) . SAMD9L , RASA4 , DOCK4 , and MLL3 are other 7q genes that have been implicated as contributing to leukemogenesis by haploinsufficiency or epigenetic transcriptional repression ( Figure 1A ) ( Asou et al . , 2009; Zhou et al . , 2011; Nagamachi et al . , 2013; Chen et al . , 2014; Poetsch et al . , 2014 ) . Here , we demonstrate hematopoietic abnormalities in mice with a germ line deletion of a contiguous CDS of chromosome band 5A3 ( 5A3+/del ) syntenic to a 2 . 5 Mb 7q22 CDS delineated by Le Beau et al . ( 1996 ) that support a mechanistic role of 7q22 deletions in MDS pathogenesis . 10 . 7554/eLife . 07839 . 003Figure 1 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 07839 . 004 2 Results and discussion We generated mice carrying a 2 Mb germ line 5A3 deletion that removes 13 genes syntenic to a human 7q22 CDS ( Figure 1A ) ( Wong et al . , 2010 ) . 5A3+/del mice are smaller than wild-type ( WT ) littermates , and homozygous deletion of the 5A3 region causes embryonic lethality before 10 . 5 dpc ( data not shown ) . Total nucleated bone marrow ( BM ) cell counts as well as spleen and thymus weights are reduced in mutant animals ( Figure 1B–D ) , which maintain normal peripheral blood cell counts . Differential expression of CD150 distinguishes HSC populations with different self-renewal , differentiation , and repopulating potentials . Specifically , HSCs , with a surface c-kit+ , lineage− , Sca-1+ ( KLS ) , and CD150hi ( CD150hi HSC ) immunophenotype possess potent self-renewal capacity , are predisposed to myeloid differentiation and expand upon aging ( Kiel et al . , 2005; Beerman et al . , 2010a; Hock , 2010 ) . Strikingly , the proportion of CD150hi HSCs is increased in 5A3+/del BM with a corresponding decrease in the percentage of CD150 negative multi-potent progenitors ( CD150neg MPP ) ( Figure 1E , Figure 1—figure supplement 1A ) . This results in a normal frequency of CD150hi HSCs in 5A3+/del mice , despite an overall reduction in the size of the stem/progenitor compartment ( Figure 1F ) . The proportion of CMPs is elevated in 5A3+/del mice and the frequency of GMPs is decreased ( Figure 1G , H , Figure 1—figure supplement 1B ) , which is consistent with changes in these populations in MDS patients ( Will et al . , 2012; Pang et al . , 2013 ) . Thus , the 5A3 deletion perturbs HSC and myeloid progenitor populations . By contrast , the proportions and frequencies of common lymphoid progenitors are similar in WT and 5A3+/del mice ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–E ) . We mixed donor 5A3+/del or WT BM cells with WT BM at ratios of 1:1 and 1:2 and transplanted them into irradiated recipients . Whereas 5A3 mutant BM had markedly reduced lymphoid repopulating capacity , these cells efficiently contributed to the c-kit+lin−Sca-1+ ( KLS ) compartment ( Figure 2A , B ) . To investigate if the altered repopulating potential of 5A3+/del BM is intrinsic to CD150hi HSC , we injected 15 of these cells into lethally irradiated recipients with WT BM competitors . Similar to whole BM , CD150hi HSC from 5A3+/del mice exhibited reduced overall repopulation potential due to defective lymphoid reconstitution ( Figure 2C–F ) . Importantly , however , 5A3+/del HSC efficiently reconstituted KLS and myeloid compartments in both primary and secondary recipients ( Figure 2E , F ) . 5A3+/del CD150hi HSC exhibited markedly reduced lymphoid repopulating potential in WT and 5A3+/del recipients , whereas WT cells restored lymphoid repopulation in 5A3+/del hosts almost as well as in WT recipients , demonstrating that the repopulation defects in 5A3+/del CD150hi HSCs are cell intrinsic ( Figure 2C–F ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 07839 . 005Figure 2 .

( G–I ) 100 CD150hi HSC , CD150lo HSC , and CD150neg MPP from 8- to 12-week-old 5A3+/del mice and their WT littermates were plated into methylcellulose medium supplemented with cytokines ( n = 6 for each genotype ) .

( A ) BrdU labeling frequencies of K+L−S+ and K+L−S− cells from WT and 5A3+/del mice taken 24 hr after intraperitoneal injection of BrdU . ( B ) HSCs were labeled with EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-biotin ( biotin ) in vivo , and the in vivo proliferative behavior of HSCs was tracked by dilution of the biotin label caused by cell division . Biotin intensities on CD150hi HSC , CD150lo HSC , and CD150neg MPP taken 15 min and 6 days after intravenous injection of biotin ( representative plots from one of 3 mice in each group ) . Following 6 days of chase , the reduction in biotin label intensity is similar in WT and 5A3+/del CD150hi HSC , CD150lo HSC , and CD150neg MPP . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 07839 . 006 WT and 5A3+/del HSCs generated similar numbers of myeloid colonies in methylcellulose cultures supplemented with cytokines; however , colonies grown from 5A3+/del CD150hi HSC contained significantly fewer cells ( Figure 2G , H ) . By contrast , 5A3+/del CD150neg MPP showed a 1 . 4-fold increase in colony forming activity but a similar number of cells per colony as WT MPP ( Figure 2G , I ) . In vivo labeling experiments revealed similar rates of BrdU incorporation , cell division , and apoptosis in WT and 5A3+/del K+L−S+ and myeloid progenitor ( MP ) cells ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1A , B and data not shown ) ( Nygren and Bryder , 2008 ) . Physiologic aging is characterized by impaired HSC repopulating potential , diminished lymphoid differentiation , the dominance of CD150hi HSCs that are skewed toward myeloid differentiation and a markedly increased risk of MDS ( Beerman et al . , 2010a; Beerman et al . , 2010b ) . Similarly , the abnormal distribution of HSCs is exacerbated in 24- to 30-month-old 5A3+/del mice ( Figure 3A , B ) . Consistent with data from younger mice ( Figure 2A–F ) , aged 5A3 mutant BM displayed markedly reduced lymphoid repopulating potential , but efficiently contributed to myeloid reconstitution ( Figure 3C , D ) . Old 5A3+/del BM cells also repopulated the KLS compartment significantly better than WT BM in recipients analyzed 4 months after transplantation , and 5A3+/del cells exhibited a twofold increase in contribution to the KLS and MP populations upon serial transplantation ( Figure 3C , D ) . Despite these HSC abnormalities , 5A3+/del mice have a normal lifespan , and the underlying causes of death are similar to WT littermates ( data not shown ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 07839 . 007Figure 3 . Effects of aging and Gata2 inactivation on 5A3+/del hematopoietic cells . ( A and B ) Percent contributions ( A ) and frequencies ( B ) of CD150hi HSC , CD150lo HSC , and CD150neg MPP within the K+L−S+CD41−CD48− compartment in 5A3+/del mice ( n = 12 ) and their WT littermates ( n = 11 ) at 24–30 months of age .

Data shown are mean values ±SEM of results from two independent experiments . ( E ) Total numbers of BM cells from 2 femurs and 2 tibiae in 5A3+/del mice , Gata2+/− mice , compound Gata2+/−; 5A3+/del mice and WT littermates at 8–12 weeks of age .

( H ) BM cells from WT , 5A3+/del , Gata2+/− or compound Gata2+/−; 5A3+/del mice ( n = 5 of each genotype ) were each mixed at ratios of 1:1 with WT competitor cells and transplanted into two irradiated WT recipients . Percent contribution to the K+L−S+ ( KLS ) , K+L−S− ( MP ) , myeloid , B and T cell lineages in the BM of recipient mice 6 months after primary transplants . Data shown are mean values ±SEM from five independent experiments with significant differences designed by asterisks as follows: *p < 0 . 05 , **p < 0 . 01 , ***p < 0 . 001 . The enhanced repopulating ability of compound Gata2+/−; 5A3+/del vs Gata2 singly mutant HSC achieved borderline statistical significance in three myeloid populations ( KLS ( p = 0 . 09 ) , MP ( p = 0 . 09 ) , and myeloid cells ( p = 0 . 12 ) ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 07839 . 007 GATA2 mutations cause familial MDS , which is frequently characterized by −7/del ( 7q ) ( Hahn et al . , 2011; Bodor et al . , 2012; Pasquet et al . , 2013 ) . We generated Gata2+/−; 5A3+/del mice , quantified HSC and progenitor populations , and performed competitive repopulation experiments . Like 5A3+/del mutant mice , Gata2+/−; 5A3+/del mice have reduced BM cellularity and spleen weights ( Figure 3E , F ) , and the CD150hi HSC bias is augmented by concomitant Gata2 deletion ( Figure 3G ) . Whereas lymphoid reconstitution is similarly impaired in 5A3+/del and compound mutant mice , the 5A3 deletion partially rescues the repopulating deficit of Gata2+/− BM in the KLS , MP , and myeloid compartments ( Figure 3H ) ( Rodrigues et al . , 2005 ) . These data suggest that the 7q22 CDS contributes to transformation in familial MDS by impairing lymphoid differentiation while also modestly enhancing the growth of GATA2 mutant HSC and their myeloid progeny . Transcriptome ( RNA-Seq ) and TaqMan quantitative real-time PCR analyses revealed a ∼50% reduction in the expression of multiple genes and of the long intergenic non-coding RNA 503142E22Rik within the 5A3 interval in mutant HSC and MPP ( Figure 4A , B ) . Gene Set Enrichment Analysis ( GSEA ) of the RNA-Seq data from 5A3+/del HSCs further demonstrated reduced expression of multiple gene sets related to oxidative phosphorylation ( OXPHOS ) that are similarly down-regulated in the early stages of human therapy-induced MDS and AML ( Figure 4C ) ( Mootha et al . , 2003; Li et al . , 2011 ) . OXPHOS is the metabolic pathway used by cells to generate adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) . OXPHOS is regulated by mitochondrial membrane potential , and defects in this metabolic pathway can increase levels of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) . However , sorted WT and 5A3+/del HSC and MPP showed similar ATP levels ( Figure 4D ) . Membrane potential and intracellular ROS levels were also similar in HSC and MPP from young mice , but ROS levels were increased by ∼50% in the HSC and MPP of aged 5A3+/del mice ( Figure 4E , F ) . Elevated ROS levels in HSCs correlate with reduced self-renewal capacity , impaired multi-lineage repopulating ability , and myeloid-biased differentiation ( Jang and Sharkis , 2007 ) . ROS levels are also increased in t-MDS/AML BM ( Reinecke et al . , 2009; Li et al . , 2011 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 07839 . 008Figure 4 . Changes in gene expression and oxidative phosphorylation in 5A3+/del HSC and MP . ( A ) Relative mRNA abundances for genes within the deleted 5A3 interval expressed at detectable levels in sorted HSC populations were determined by TaqMan reverse transcriptase PCR ( n = 3 per genotype ) . ( B ) Expression levels of genes located within and flanking the deleted interval measured by RNA-Seq in sorted CD150hi HSC and CD150lo HSC from 5 mice of each genotype . Each column presents data from an individual mouse , and genes within the 5A3 deleted region are delimited with a black box . Three non-coding RNAs ( 6030443J06Rik , AC112688 . 1 and 5031425E22Rik ) are located within the 5A3 deletion . Two of these ( 6030443J06Rik and AC112688 . 1 ) are expressed at extremely low levels in HSC , and the other ( 5031425E22Rik ) showed ∼50% lower expression in 5A3+/del HSC . 5031425E22Rik is homologous to the human KMT2E ( a . k . a . MLL5 ) antisense RNA1 . Expression levels of the flanking Fbxl13 and Srpk2 genes are modestly up-regulated in 5A3+/del HSC , which is consistent with the targeting strategy used to generate the segmental deletion . ( C ) Gene Set Enrichment Analysis of 5A3+/del CD150hi HSCs revealed negative enrichment for genes associated with oxidative phosphorylation ( OXPHOS ) . False discovery rate ( FDR ) q-val , nominal p-value ( NOM p-value ) , and normalized enrichment scores ( NESs ) are indicated . ( D ) ATP levels in HSC and MPP from 8- to 12-week-old WT ( n = 6 ) and 5A3+/del ( n = 5 ) mice . Data shown are mean values ±SEM of results from two independent experiments . ( E ) Fold change in the mean MitoTracker Orange fluorescence levels in 5A3+/del cells normalized to values in WT cells analyzed in the same experiment . ( F ) Fold change in the mean fluorescence level ( MFI ) of 5A3+/del cells that are CellROX Orange positive normalized to values in WT cells analyzed in the same experiment . For the MitoTracker and CellROX experiments , n = 13 for WT and n = 12 for 5A3+/del young mice , three independent experiments; n = 5 for WT and n = 6 for 5A3+/del aged mice , two independent experiments . Data shown are mean values ±SEM of results from independent experiments . ( G and H ) Oxygen consumption rate ( OCR ) was assessed basally and in response to the mitochondrial inhibitors oligomycin ( oligo ) , carbonyl cyanide 4- ( trifluoromethoxy ) phenylhydrazone ( FCCP ) , and antimycin A and rotenone ( A/R ) for ( G ) KLS and ( H ) MP cells . Data are shown as mean ±SEM of n = 5 mice of each genotype from two independent experiments . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 07839 . 008 Down-regulation of OXPHOS genes is expected to reduce mitochondrial respiration in HSC ( Warr and Passegue , 2013 ) . We attempted to directly measure oxygen consumption rates ( OCRs ) in CD150hi and CD150lo HSC but could not obtain reproducible results due to limiting cell numbers . We therefore compared the OCRs of KLS , MP , B , and T cells isolated from 1-year-old WT and 5A3+/del mice . 5A3+/del KLS cells showed a similar basal OCR as their WT counterparts , but a slightly lower maximal respiratory capacity that did not reach statistical significance ( p = 0 . 2562 ) ( Figure 4G ) . 5A3+/del MPs surprisingly showed a significantly higher basal respiration and maximal respiratory capacity in comparison to WT cells , supporting an overall increase in energy consumption ( Figure 4H ) . Meanwhile , mature 5A3+/del B and T cells have similar mitochondrial stress profiles as WT cells . We conclude that global changes in OXPHOS gene expression exert a modest impact on cellular metabolism in aged 5A3 mutant HSC and progenitors . Interestingly , treatment with N-acetyl-L-cysteine ( NAC ) did not reverse the hematopoietic abnormalities in young 5A3+/del mice ( data not shown ) , suggesting that they are a direct consequence of the 5A3 deletion and are not secondary to ROS production . Segmental deletions are among the most frequent genetic alterations in human cancer , and simultaneous loss of multiple haploinsufficient TSGs that individually have minimal phenotypic consequences appears to underlie the growth advantage conferred by most of these chromosomal losses ( Solimini et al . , 2012 ) . We show that a haploinsufficient deletion in mice that models loss of a human 7q22 CDS causes hematopoietic abnormalities that include a myeloid lineage output bias , impaired lymphoid repopulating potential , and a pronounced age-associated expansion of HSC and MPs . These functional abnormalities support a role of 7q22 deletions in MDS pathogenesis . The seven genes within the deleted 5A3 segment that are expressed in HSC encode proteins that regulate diverse cellular processes including transcription ( Mll5 and Dnajc2 ) , mitochondrial quality control ( Pmpcb , Armc10 ) , protein degradation ( Psmc2 ) , biosynthesis of N-acylethanolamines ( Napepld ) , and DNA replication ( Orc5 ) ( Luciano et al . , 1997; Quintana et al . , 1998; Fujiki et al . , 2009; Sebastian et al . , 2009; Richly et al . , 2010; Nijhawan et al . , 2012; Tsuboi et al . , 2013; Zhou et al . , 2013; Serrat et al . , 2014 ) . Given this , it is likely that the haploinsufficiency for multiple interacting genes leads to altered hematopoietic differentiation and function in 5A3+/del mice . Similar to the 5A3+/del mice described here , other mutations found in MDS patients perturb hematopoiesis , but do not consistently induce hematologic disease in the absence of cooperating mutations ( Beurlet et al . , 2013 ) . This is not unexpected given the advanced age of most MDS patients and the presence of multiple genetic lesions in diseased BM . The 5A3+/del mice reported here thus provide a novel resource for addressing how this common deletion cooperates with other mutations to drive myeloid transformation , progression to AML , and drug resistance . 3 Materials and methods We expressed Cre recombinase in embryonic stem cells containing LoxP sites and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase ( HPRT ) sequences flanking the Fbxl13 and Srpk2 genes ( Wong et al . , 2010 ) and analyzed clones that grew in hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine ( HAT ) medium to identify the desired 2 Mb deletion . 5A3del/+ mice were generated by standard blastocyst injection followed by mating coat color chimeras and were backcrossed for at least 10 generations onto a C57BL/6J background . Gata2+/− mice were a generous gift from Dr Stuart Orkin ( Harvard Medical School ) ( Tsai et al . , 1994 ) . Study mice were housed in a specific pathogen-free facility at the University of California San Francisco , and all animal experiments were conducted under protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee . Genotyping and disease monitoring were performed as previously described ( Wong et al . , 2010 ) . BM cells flushed from tibias and femurs were subjected to ammonium-chloride potassium red cell lysis before staining with antibodies . For experiments requiring cell sorting , the spinal cord , flat bone of the pelvis , humerus , and sternum of the mice were also crushed and lysed . Low-density mononuclear cells were separated using a HISTOPAQUE-1119 gradient ( Sigma–Aldrich , St . Louis , MO , United States ) . For identification and sorting of CD150hi-HSC , CD150lo-HSC , and CD150neg-MPP , cells were pre-incubated with purified CD16/32 ( 2 . 4G2 ) , followed by staining with a lineage cocktail of PE-conjugated antibodies including B220 ( RA3-6B2 ) , CD8 ( 53-6 . 7 ) , Gr-1 ( RB6-8C5 ) , CD3 ( 17A2 ) , Ter119 ( TER-119 ) , CD41 ( MWReg30 ) , and CD48 ( HM48-1 ) , as well as PE-Cy7 c-kit ( 2B8 ) , PacBlue Sca-1 ( E13-161 . 7 ) , and APC CD150 ( TC15-12F12 . 2 ) from BioLegend ( San Diego , CA , United States ) . For experiments requiring cell sorting , cells expressing c-kit were enriched by magnetic cell sorting by staining with mouse CD117 microbeads and positively selected on the MS columns ( Miltenyi Biotec , Germany ) according to manufacturer's protocol before antibody staining . Cells were classified as CD150hi-HSC , CD150lo-HSC , or CD150neg-MPP based in levels of CD150 expression . Percent contribution of common myeloid progenitor ( CMP ) , granulocyte-monocyte progenitor ( GMP ) , and megakaryocyte erythroid progenitors ( MEP ) within the Lin−Sca1+c-kit+ compartment of 5A3+/del mice and WT littermates . CMP , GMP , and megakaryocyte erythroid progenitors ( MEP ) populations were identified by flow cytometry after staining with a lineage cocktail of PE-conjugated antibodies including B220 ( RA3-6B2 ) , CD8 ( 53-6 . 7 ) , Gr-1 ( RB6-8C5 ) , CD3 ( 17A2 ) , and Ter119 ( TER-119 ) , as well as APC-750 c-kit ( 2B8 ) , PacBlue Sca-1 ( E13-161 . 7 ) , Alexa Fluor 647 CD16/32 ( 93 ) , biotin CD34 ( MEC14 . 7 ) , and a streptavidin PE-Cy7 conjugate ( BioLegend ) . Stained BM cells were analyzed in a FACS LSRII instrument and sorted in a FACS Aria3 ( Becton Dickinson , San Jose , CA , United States ) . FlowJo software ( Tree Star , Inc . , Ashland , OR , United States ) was used to analyze and display the data . BM cells from WT , 5A3+/del , Gata2+/− , Gata2+/−5A3+/del mice on a C57BL/6J background ( CD45 . 2 ) were used as donor cells . Competitor cells were isolated from 8- to 12-week-old BoyJ mice ( CD45 . 1 ) . Recipient F1 hybrid mice from a cross between C57BL/6J and BoyJ mice ( CD45 . 1 + CD45 . 2 ) were at least 8 weeks old at the time of lethal irradiation ( 9 . 5 Gy from a cesium source delivered in split dose 3 hr apart ) . After irradiation , the cells were injected via the tail vein of recipient mice . For evaluation of the competitiveness of whole BM , we injected 106 whole BM cells at a 1:1 or 1:2 donor to competitor ratio . To evaluate the repopulating potential of purified CD150hi-HSC , we injected 15 CD150hi-HSC sorted from 8- to 12-week-old WT and 5A3+/del mice together with 2 . 5 × 105 BM competitor cells into lethally irradiated recipients . Blood was obtained from recipient mice every 30 days beginning 1 month after transplant , and cells were stained with Alexa Fluor 700 CD45 . 2 ( 104 ) , PE-Cy7 CD45 . 1 ( A20 ) , PacBlue B220 ( RA3-6B2 ) , FITC CD4 ( GK1 . 5 ) , FITC CD8 ( 53-6 . 7 ) , PE Mac-1 ( M1/70 ) , and PE Gr-1 ( RB6-8C5 ) to determine the percent donor cell contribution to myeloid and B and T lymphoid lineages . Primary recipient mice were euthanized 6 months after transplantation , BM were isolated from the tibiae and femur , and 2 × 106 BM cells were injected into secondary recipients to test serial repopulation potential . To determine the contribution of donor-derived cells in the K+L−S+ compartment , BM cells were stained with V450 CD45 . 2 ( 104 ) , APC-780 CD45 . 1 ( A20 ) , PE B220 ( RA3-6B2 ) , PE CD8 ( 53-6 . 7 ) , PE Gr-1 ( RB6-8C5 ) , PE CD3 ( 17A2 ) , PE Ter119 ( TER-119 ) , PE-Cy7 c-kit ( 2B8 ) , and APC Sca-1 ( E13-161 . 7 ) . Secondary recipients were analyzed as in the primary recipients . CD150hi-HSC , CD150lo-HSC , and CD150neg-MPP were isolated as described above , and 100 cells were seeded into methylcellulose medium as described ( Mohrin et al . , 2010 ) . Colonies were counted on day 7 , and the entire contents of a methylcellulose culture from an individual plate were then flushed out using phosphate-buffered saline and counted in a hemocytometer . Cells were also spun in a Cytospin 3 Cytocentrifuge ( Shandon/Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA , United States ) at 400 rpm for 8 min , and differential cell counting and morphological analysis performed after Wright-Giemsa staining . CD150hi-HSC , CD150lo-HSC , and CD150neg-MPP were sorted as above into 500 µl of TRIzol reagent ( Life Technologies , Grand Island , NY , United States ) . RNA was isolated according to manufacturer's instructions and precipitated with the addition of glycogen ( New England BioLabs , Ipswich , MA , United States ) . The RNA was then treated with DNAse 1 ( Ambion , Austin , TX , United States ) and purified with the RNeasy MinElute Cleanup Kit ( Qiagen , Valencia , CA , United States ) . For TaqMan analysis , reverse transcription was carried out using the High Capacity RNA-to-cDNA Master Mix ( Life Technologies ) . Relative quantification of gene expression was determined by performing quantitative real-time PCR using the following TaqMan Gene Expression Assays ( Applied Biosystems ) : Armc10 ( Mm03011576_g1 ) , Mll5 ( Mm01129502_g1 ) , Napepld ( Mm00724596_m1 ) , Orc5 ( Mm00457242_m1 ) , Psmc2 ( Mm00803207_m1 ) , Dnajc2 ( Mm00494389_m1 ) , Pmpcb ( Mm01138654_m1 ) , Srpk2 ( Mm00486413_m1 ) , Fbxl13 ( Mm00622025_m1 ) , Lrrc17 ( Mm01167263_m1 ) , Slc26a5 ( Mm00446145_m1 ) , Reln ( Mm00465200_m1 ) , Lhfpl3 ( Mm03038441_m1 ) , and Gapdh ( Mm99999915_g1 ) with the TaqMan Gene Expression Master Mix ( ABI ) . PCR reactions were performed on an ABI 7900HT Real-Time PCR System ( Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA , United States ) with the Taqman Gene Expression Master Mix ( Applied Biosystems ) according to manufacturer's instructions . PCR cycling conditions were 2 min at 50°C and 10 min at 95°C , followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95°C and 1 min at 60°C . All reactions were carried out in triplicate , and target quantities were determined using a relative standard curve . The amounts of target were normalized to the endogenous control gene Gapdh and compared with the corresponding WT BM ( calibrator sample ) to determine relative fold differences . For RNA-Seq analysis , total RNA ( 10 ng ) was converted into double-stranded cDNA using the Ovation RNA Amplification System V2 ( NuGen , San Carlo , CA , United States ) per manufacturer's recommendations . The amplified cDNA products were then used to generate RNA-seq libraries using the TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit v2 reagents ( Illumina , San Diego , CA , United States ) per manufacturer's instructions , with 10 PCR amplification cycles . Library quality and quantity were assessed by the Agilent DNA1000 Chip ( Agilent , Santa Clara , CA , United States ) and qPCR ( Kappa Biosystems Inc , Woburn , MA , United States ) . 10 pM of each library was sequenced using Illumina SBS chemistry at 2 × 100 bp reads on the HiSeq2000 ( Illumina , San Diego , CA , United States ) . The RNA-Seq paired-end reads were mapped to the mouse mm9 genome using an in-house mapping and quality assessment pipeline ( Zhang et al . , 2012 ) . The expression of each gene was estimated by the mean coverage of the highest covered coding exon . Genes with low-expression level ( <10 ) across all samples were filtered out , followed by quantile normalization . Differential expression analysis was performed using limma ( Smyth , 2004 ) with estimation of false discovery rate ( Benjamini and Hochberg , 1995 ) . GSEA ( Subramanian et al . , 2005 , 2007 ) was used to assess pathway enrichment . HSC and MPP were sorted into phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) , and 600 CD150hi-HSC , 1000 CD150lo-HSC , and 1000 CD150neg-MPP were aliquoted into a well of a 96-well plate in triplicate . ATP was quantified using the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay ( Promega , Madison , WI , United States ) following manufacturer's recommendations . Illumination was quantified with a Synergy 2 ( Biotek , Winooski , VT , United States ) . For flow cytometric analysis of ROS levels and membrane potential in CD150hi-HSC , CD150lo-HSC , and CD150neg-MPP , BM cells were isolated and enriched for c-kit positive cells as described . c-kit positive cells were stained with an unconjugated cocktail of purified antibodies including B220 ( RA3-6B2 ) , CD8 ( 53-6 . 7 ) , Gr-1 ( RB6-8C5 ) , CD3 ( 17A2 ) , Ter119 ( TER-119 ) , and CD41 ( MWReg30 ) from BioLegend , followed by PECy-5 IgG GOAT anti-RAT pAb ( HI47 ) antibody from Molecular Probes and IgG from rat serum ( I4131 Sigma ) . After incubation with 50 nM CellROX Orange Reagent ( Molecular Probes ) or 20 nM MitoTracker Orange CMTMRos ( Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR , United States ) for 30 min at 37°C in IMDM , cells were washed and stained with 7-amino-actinomycin D , PE-Cy7 c-kit ( 2B8 ) , PacBlue Sca-1 ( E13-161 . 7 ) , PE-Cy5 CD48 ( HM48-1 ) , and APC CD150 ( TC15-12F12 . 2 ) from BioLegend . The OCR was analyzed in an XF96 extracellular flux analyzer following manufacturer's protocol ( Seahorse Biosciences , Billerica , MA , United States ) . Freshly isolated K+L−S+ cells and K+L−S− cells were cultured in StemSpan serum-free medium ( STEMCELL Technologies , Vancouver , Canada ) supplemented with SCF ( 100 ng/ml ) and Tpo ( 100 ng/ml ) , while freshly isolated thymic cells and B-220+ splenic cells were cultured in RPMI medium 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and incubated at 37° in a humidified atmosphere containing 8% CO2 for 12–15 hr . Cells were then washed three times with Mito Stress Media ( XF base media supplemented with glucose [3 mg/ml] , sodium pyruvate [1 mM] , and Glutamax [2 mM] adjusted to a pH = 7 . 4 ) and seeded in XF96 microplates coated with poly-L-lysine ( Sigma ) . 60000 K+L−S+ cells , 100000 K+L−S− cells , 200000 thymic cells , and 200000 B220+ splenic cells were plated per well , respectively . K+L−S+ and K+L−S− cells were stimulated with SCF ( 100 ng/ml ) and Tpo ( 100 ng/ml ) , while thymic cells were stimulated with interleukin ( IL ) -2 ( 20 ng/ml ) and IL-7 ( 10 ng/ml ) and B-220+ splenic cells were stimulated with IL-7 ( 10 ng/ml ) and maintained in a non-CO2 incubator for 1 hr before the assay . Five baseline recordings were made , followed by sequential injection of Oligomycin ( Sigma ) , Carbonyl Cyanide 4- ( trifluoromethoxy ) phenylhydrazone ( Sigma ) , and a combination of Antimycin A ( Sigma ) and Rotenone ( Sigma ) to determine the mitochondrial respiration rate under various conditions . Data are presented as mean values ±SEM unless stated otherwise . Statistical significance was determined by performing two-tailed Student's t-tests . CLP were identified and evaluated by flow cytometry by staining with a lineage cocktail of PE-conjugated antibodies including B220 ( RA3-6B2 ) , CD8 ( 53-6 . 7 ) , Gr-1 ( RB6-8C5 ) , CD3 ( 17A2 ) , and Ter119 ( TER-119 ) , as well as APC-750 c-kit ( 2B8 ) , PacBlue Sca-1 ( E13-161 . 7 ) , APC IL-7Rα ( A7R34 ) and biotin Flk2 ( A2F10 ) , and a streptavidin PE-Cy7 conjugate ( BioLegend ) . Mice received an initial intraperitoneal injection of BrdU ( Sigma–Aldrich , 1 mg/6 g mouse weight ) and were then maintained on 1 . 0 mg/ml BrdU in the drinking water 24 hr prior to sacrifice . To measure BrdU incorporation , BM cells were enriched for c-kit positive cells using c-kit antibody-conjugated microbeads ( Miltenyi ) . Enriched BM cells were pre-incubated with purified CD16/32 ( 2 . 4G2 ) , followed by staining with a lineage cocktail of PE-conjugated antibodies including B220 ( RA3-6B2 ) , CD8 ( 53-6 . 7 ) , Gr-1 ( RB6-8C5 ) , CD3 ( 17A2 ) , Ter119 ( TER-119 ) , as well as PECy7 c-kit ( 2B8 ) and PacBlue Sca-1 ( E13-161 . 7 ) ( BioLegend ) . BrdU incorporation was then assayed according to manufacturer's instructions of the APC BrdU Flow Kit ( BD Pharmingen , San Jose , CA , United States ) . NHS-biotin ( EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-biotin; Life Technologies ) was dissolved at 10 mg/ml in normal saline and injected into mice intravenously via the tail vein at 1 mg/6 g mouse weight . To assess biotin dilution in the HSC subpopulations , BM cells were enriched for c-kit positive cells using c-kit antibody-conjugated microbeads ( Miltenyi ) . Enriched cells were pre-incubated with purified CD16/32 ( 2 . 4G2 ) , followed by staining with a lineage cocktail of PE-conjugated antibodies including B220 ( RA3-6B2 ) , CD8 ( 53-6 . 7 ) , Gr-1 ( RB6-8C5 ) , CD3 ( 17A2 ) , Ter119 ( TER-119 ) , CD41 ( MWReg30 ) , and CD48 ( HM48-1 ) , as well as PerCP/Cy5 . 5 c-kit ( 2B8 ) , PacBlue Sca-1 ( E13-161 . 7 ) , APC CD150 ( TC15-12F12 . 2 ) , and PECy-7-conjugated Streptavidin ( BioLegend ) ."}
{"doi": "elife-51015-v1", "abstract": "Antimalarial drug resistance has historically arisen through convergent de novo mutations in Plasmodium falciparum parasite populations in Southeast Asia and South America . For the past decade in Southeast Asia , artemisinins , the core component of first-line antimalarial therapies , have experienced delayed parasite clearance associated with several pfk13 mutations , primarily C580Y . We report that mutant pfk13 has emerged independently in Guyana , with genome analysis indicating an evolutionary origin distinct from Southeast Asia . Pfk13 C580Y parasites were observed in 1 . 6% ( 14/854 ) of samples collected in Guyana in 2016–2017 . Introducing pfk13 C580Y or R539T mutations by gene editing into local parasites conferred high levels of in vitro artemisinin resistance . In vitro growth competition assays revealed a fitness cost associated with these pfk13 variants , potentially explaining why these resistance alleles have not increased in frequency more quickly in South America . These data place local malaria control efforts at risk in the Guiana Shield .", "plain language summary": "All recommended treatments against malaria include a drug called artemisinin or some of its derivatives . However , there are concerns that Plasmodium falciparum , the parasite that causes most cases of malaria , will eventually develop widespread resistance to the drug . A strain of P . falciparum partially resistant to artemisinin was seen in Cambodia in 2008 , and it has since spread across Southeast Asia . The resistance appears to be frequently linked to a mutation known as pfk13 C580Y . Southeast Asia and Amazonia are considered to be hotspots for antimalarial drug resistance , and the pfk13 C580Y mutation was detected in the South American country of Guyana in 2010 . To examine whether the mutation was still circulating in this part of the world , Mathieu et al . collected and analyzed 854 samples across Guyana between 2016 and 2017 . Overall , 1 . 6% of the samples had the pfk13 C580Y mutation , but this number was as high as 8 . 8% in one region . Further analyses revealed that the mutation in Guyana had not spread from Southeast Asia , but that it had occurred in Amazonia independently . To better understand the impact of the pfk13 C580Y mutation , Mathieu et al . introduced this genetic change into non-resistant parasites from a country neighbouring Guyana . As expected , the mutation made P . falciparum highly resistant to artemisinin , but it also slowed the growth rate of the parasite . This disadvantage may explain why the mutation has not spread more rapidly through Guyana in recent years . Artemisinin and its derivatives are always associated with other antimalarial drugs to slow the development of resistance; there are concerns that reduced susceptibility to artemisinin leads to the parasites becoming resistant to the partner drugs . Further research is needed to evaluate how the pfk13 C580Y mutation affects the parasite’s response to the typical combination of drugs that are given to patients .", "article": "1 Introduction Malaria is an important parasitic disease that causes a high level of mortality worldwide . In 2018 , malaria was estimated to have caused 405 , 000 deaths , most of them attributable to the virulent Plasmodium falciparum parasite species ( World Health Organization , 2019 ) . Most malaria cases occur in Sub-Saharan Africa , but Southeast Asia and South America are also affected . Since 2001 , Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies ( ACTs ) have been the recommended first-line therapy for P . falciparum infection for almost all malaria-endemic areas ( World Health Organization , 2001 ) . ACTs combine an artemisinin derivative and one partner drug ( most commonly lumefantrine , mefloquine , amodiaquine , piperaquine or pyronaridine ) . These treatments have contributed to a major reduction in malaria-related mortality and morbidity ( Eastman and Fidock , 2009; Carrara et al . , 2006; Bhatt et al . , 2015 ) . However , in 2008 , the first instances of reduced artemisinin efficacy were described in western Cambodia ( Dondorp et al . , 2009; Ashley et al . , 2014 ) . Subsequent studies have documented the rapid spread of resistance throughout Southeast Asia ( Dondorp et al . , 2009; Ashley et al . , 2014; World Health Organization , 2018 ) . Resistance to artemisinin is partial and affects only rings ( World Health Organization , 2018 ) . Clinically , this partial resistance trait manifests as a parasite clearance half-life that exceeds 5 . 5 hr ( WWARN K13 Genotype-Phenotype Study Group , 2019 ) . This half-life represents the time required to achieve a two-fold reduction of the parasite biomass . Partial resistance also manifests as persistent parasitemia on day three with a complete clearance of parasites following full treatment with an artesunate monotherapy lasting seven days or with an ACT ( World Health Organization , 2018 ) . An analysis of P . falciparum parasites selected for artemisinin resistance in vitro as well as parasites from patients experiencing slow parasite clearance led to the identification of a genetic locus linked to resistance: a kelch domain-containing protein located on chromosome 13 ( pfk13 ) ( Ariey et al . , 2014 ) . To date , many missense mutations have been described in the BTP/POZ or kelch propeller domain-containing parts of this protein in clinical isolates , however only nine of them have been validated for artemisinin resistance ( F446I , N458Y , M476I , Y493H , R539T , I543T , P553L , R561H and C580Y ) ( World Health Organization , 2018; Ariey et al . , 2014; Straimer et al . , 2015 ) . A larger number have been associated with delayed parasite clearance ( WWARN K13 Genotype-Phenotype Study Group , 2019 ) . In most locations , the pfk13 C580Y mutation has overtaken other resistance-inducing variants , and it is now the most prevalent pfk13 variant in Southeast Asia ( Ashley et al . , 2014; Ariey et al . , 2014 ) . South America has historically been a second hotspot outside Southeast Asia for the evolution of antimalarial drug resistance . For example , chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance evolved simultaneously in both regions ( Wootton et al . , 2002; Roper et al . , 2004 ) . The Guiana Shield region of South America , which includes Guyana , Suriname , French Guiana and parts of Brazil , Venezuela and Colombia , is important as a potential source of emerging antimalarial drug resistance . In this region , the subsoil is rich in gold and other minerals , leading to extensive mining activities in forested areas . These mining activities favor malaria transmission , particularly P . falciparum ( Douine et al . , 2016; Heemskerk , 2011 ) . Mining also generates human population movement and inappropriate use of ACTs , as people generally work deep in the forest , far from medical care ( Pribluda et al . , 2014; Douine et al . , 2018 ) . This erratic use of ACTs , as well as self-medication using ACTs of substandard quality or artemisinin monotherapies , may promote the emergence of resistance to artemisinin . In Guyana in 2010 , 5 . 1% ( 5 out of 98 ) of P . falciparum-infected clinical samples , sharing a common haplotype different from their Cambodian counterparts , exhibited the pfk13 C580Y mutation ( Chenet et al . , 2016 ) . However , no clinical or in vitro resistance phenotypes were measured or associated with the genotype data . The most recent therapeutic efficacy study conducted in Guyana in 2014 with 50 patients failed to identify pfk13 mutations or delayed parasite clearance time after artemether/lumefantrine treatment ( Rahman et al . , 2016 ) . The sample size , however , was too small to ensure detection of low-frequency resistance mutations . The objective of the present study was to evaluate whether pfk13 variants ( C580Y or others ) have persisted in Guyana since 2010 , and if so , to evaluate their prevalence in 2016–2017 . In the absence of available clinical phenotypes associated with the pfk13 C580Y variant from patients infected and treated in this region , we evaluated the impact of two pfk13 mutations , C580Y and R539T , on in vitro resistance and the rate of parasite growth in a South American parasite genetic background . 2 Results We genotyped the propeller domain of the pfk13 gene by Sanger sequencing 854 samples collected between March 2016 and September 2017 from different malaria-endemic regions of Guyana . Fourteen samples bearing the pfk13 C580Y variant were identified , representing a prevalence of 1 . 6% ( CI950 . 8–2 . 5% ) . The prevalence of mutants was 8 . 8% ( CI953 . 6–14 . 0% ) in Region 1 , 0 . 7% ( CI950 . 0–2 . 0% ) in Region 8 and 0 . 5% ( CI950 . 0–1 . 1% ) in Region 7 ( Figure 1 , Figure 1—source data 1 ) . We also genotyped the sequence outside of the propeller domain for 283 samples . Among these , 57 . 2% ( CI9551 . 5–63 . 0% ) were the 3D7 reference genotype , 42 . 0% ( CI9536 . 3–47 . 8% ) carried the pfk13 K189T mutation and 0 . 7% ( CI950 . 0–1 . 7% ) had a mixed genotype ( wild-type/K189T ) . All samples bearing the pfk13 C580Y variant also exhibited the pfk13 K189T mutation , which to date has not been associated with artemisinin resistance . To understand the origin of the C580Y mutation and examine the genetic relatedness of the mutant strains , we performed whole-genome sequencing ( WGS ) on thirteen of the fourteen Guyana samples exhibiting the pfk13 C580Y mutation , as well as 40 comparator samples exhibiting wild-type pfk13 and collected at comparable locations and times . The variant profile observed in the sequenced samples identified that the pfk13 C580Y variant arose on a single Guyanese parasite genetic background , and was not imported from Southeast Asia ( Figure 2a ) . Deeper examination of the genomic similarity was performed by estimating the proportion of the genome that was identical-by-descent between sample pairs . This analysis revealed an extremely high level of relatedness between sample pairs bearing pfk13 C580Y ( identity by descent ( IBD ) >0 . 77 ) relative to pairwise comparisons containing at least one wild-type pfk13 sample ( Figure 2b ) . This indicates that the parasite lineage on which C580Y arose in Guyana in 2010 probably engaged in limited sexual outcrossing with other parasite lineages in Guyana , despite having persisted for a sufficient duration of time to be observed in multiple regions of the country and to have risen to a non-negligible frequency in the Region 1 population . In the 75 kb segments flanking the 2016–2017 C580Y-coding variant , WGS identified only two low-quality single nucleotide variants among the 13 mutant samples ( Figure 2a ) . We also analyzed pfk13 C580Y parasites using eight microsatellite loci flanking the pfk13 gene . Despite missing data for some loci in some samples , two different haplotypes were identified , differing at one locus positioned at −6 . 36 kb ( Table 1 ) . The previously identified Guyana A mutant haplotype ( Chenet et al . , 2016 ) matched the most common haplotype in the 2016–2017 samples , which was markedly distinct from the one observed in pfk13 Cambodian mutants ( Chenet et al . , 2016 ) . The second 2016 haplotype exhibiting the 280 allele at the locus −6 . 36 kb has not been previously identified . As replicate genotyping efforts reproduced the allelic variant at locus −6 . 36 , it is likely that a de novo microsatellite mutation occurred at locus −6 . 36 following the origin of the C580Y mutation . The high similarity of the microsatellite haplotypes bearing C580Y between 2010 ( Chenet et al . , 2016 ) and 2016 suggests that the chromosome 13 resistance haplotype , and perhaps the full clonal lineage , has persisted over this timespan , as several of the allelic markers associated with the C580Y mutation are rare in both studies ( e . g . allele 277 at marker −6 . 36: 11%; allele 206 at marker −0 . 15: 9%; allele 244 at marker 72 . 3: 6% Chenet et al . , 2016 ) . We were not able to procure remaining DNA from the samples collected in 2010 to determine whether the entire genomic background has been preserved intact as a clonal lineage between 2010 and 2016 . However , the genotypes of the molecular markers for resistance ( pfcrt , pfdhps , pfdhfr and pfmdr1 ) were also similar between 2010 and 2016 mutant samples ( Supplementary file 1 ) . The observation of the C580Y mutation persisting in only one clonal lineage suggests that genomic background may be an important determinant of the emergence and persistence of pfk13 propeller mutations in Guyana , as was previously observed in Southeast Asia ( Miotto et al . , 2013; Miotto et al . , 2015; Cerqueira et al . , 2017; Amato et al . , 2018 ) . We therefore compared the genetic background of 53 isolates from Guyana ( 40 pfk13 wild-type and 13 pfk13 C580Y ) and the artemisinin-resistant background observed in Southeast Asian parasites , in order to explore whether partner mutations associated with pfk13-mutant parasites may be responsible for the preservation of this clonal lineage ( Miotto et al . , 2015 ) . None of the previously described mutations were observed , including the pffd D193Y , pfcrt N326S , pfcrt I356T , pfarps V127M and pfmdr2 T484I variants . The pfcrt gene was of South American origin with a 7G8 haplotype comprising the mutations C72S , K76T , A220S , N326D and I356L , with no particular difference between wild-type and pfk13 C580Y parasites ( Supplementary file 1 ) . However , within this candidate gene set , we observed two fixed differences between wild-type and pfk13 C580Y parasites , both within the gene PF3D7_1252100 ( RON3 ) ( Supplementary file 2 ) . Although overall genotyping rates were low in this gene ( successful for 15 out of 53 ) , all genotyped pfk13 C580Y mutants ( n = 5 ) contained a V1661L-coding variant and all genotyped pfk13 wild-type parasites ( n = 9 ) carried a synonymous non-reference variant at codon 1801 . We also analyzed other molecular markers for resistance ( pfcrt , pfdhps , pfdhfr and pfmdr1 ) ( Supplementary file 1 ) . All pfk13 C580Y variants were pfcrt SVMNT ( 72-76 ) /A220S/N326D/C350/I356L ( i . e . the pfcrt 7G8 haplotype ) , pfdhfr double-mutant ( N51I/S108N ) , pfdhps triple-mutant ( A437G/K540E/A581G ) and pfmdr1 triple-mutant ( Y184F/N1042D/D1246Y ) . In summary , Guyanese parasites bearing pfk13 C580Y also exhibited variants in genes previously associated with separate antimalarial drug resistance phenotypes in Southeast Asia . The highest prevalence of the Guyanese pfk13 C580Y variant was found in Region 1 . This variant was first observed in April 2016 and achieved a maximum prevalence of 25 . 0% ( CI953 . 8–46 . 2% ) in June 2016 ( Figure 3 , Figure 3—source data 1 ) . Thereafter , it was not identified between September 2016 and March 2017 despite a constant transmission level of malaria in this region during this period . To understand these fluctuations in prevalence , we studied the parasite population dynamics in the country . We compared parasites from Guyana to samples from Africa and Southeast Asia ( Supplementary file 3 ) . At synonymous sites within 4888 genes , pairwise nucleotide diversity ( πsyn ) in Guyana was 3 . 4 × 10−4 , less than half the level observed in Southeast Asia ( 7 . 4 × 10−4 ) and nearly a third of that measured in Africa ( 1 . 0 × 10−3 ) . In Guyana , 46 samples had sufficient sequencing coverage to assess their complexity of infection ( COI ) , and only one ( 2 . 2% ) showed evidence of multiple parasite lineages ( COI > 1 ) . In contrast , multiclonal infection estimates from Africa and Southeast Asia are routinely higher ( Chang et al . , 2017; Galinsky et al . , 2015; Assefa et al . , 2014; Zhu et al . , 2019 ) . Despite the low nucleotide diversity and small proportion of multiclonal infections , Guyana harbors a relatively high number of distinct parasite lineages and few parasite pairs with identical genomes . We found that only 0 . 54% of wild-type Guyanese parasite pairs showed evidence of belonging to the same clonal lineage ( IBD >0 . 75 ) . To evaluate the impact of the pfk13 C580Y mutation on artemisinin susceptibility in parasites , we culture-adapted two P . falciparum isolates ( O141-A and R086 ) from French Guiana ( a neighboring country in the Guiana Shield ) and genetically edited these lines using a previously described zinc-finger nuclease ( ZFN ) based approach ( Straimer et al . , 2015 ) . We also evaluated the impact of the variant arginine to threonine mutation at codon 539 ( R539T ) , associated with one of the highest in vitro artemisinin resistance levels in Asian parasites ( Ariey et al . , 2014; Straimer et al . , 2015 ) . These two culture-adapted lines both exhibit the pfcrt SVMNT haplotype that is associated with chloroquine resistance , but only R086 carries the pfcrt C350R mutation that was earlier found to restore chloroquine susceptibility to South American parasites despite the presence of the SVMNT haplotype ( Pelleau et al . , 2015 ) . These parasite lines from French Guiana exhibit a high level of genomic similarity to our genome-sequenced Guyanese parasites ( Figures 2c and d; Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) . These findings suggest that phenotypes observed in these lines from French Guiana are relevant for understanding the impact of the pfk13 C580Y variant in Guyanese parasites , none of which have yet been adapted to in vitro culture . We produced isogenic lines expressing the wild-type pfk13 allele ( R086ctrl , O141-Actrl ) or the pfk13 C580Y mutation ( R086C580Y , O141-AC580Y ) , or the pfk13 R539T allele in the case of R086 ( R086R539T ) . We measured the phenotypic impact of those mutations on in vitro artemisinin resistance in edited and parental lines using the Ring-stage Survival Assay ( Witkowski et al . , 2013 ) that begins with 0–3 hr post-invasion rings ( RSA0-3h ) . Introducing the pfk13 C580Y mutation caused a significant increase in the survival rate ( twenty-three fold in R086: 0 . 6% ± 0 . 2 for R086 to 13 . 7% ± 1 . 5 for R086C580Y , p=0 . 006; fifty-five fold in O141-A: 0 . 5% ± 0 . 1 for O141-A compared to 27 . 6% ± 7 . 0 for O141-AC580Y , p=0 . 030 , Figure 4 , Figure 4—source data 1 ) . R086R539T showed a survival rate fifty-five times higher than the parental line ( 33 . 0% ± 5 . 0 compared to 0 . 6% ± 0 . 2 , p=0 . 011 ) . Control assays found no significant difference in the survival rate of the parental vs . isogenic control lines ( 0 . 6% ± 0 . 2 for R086 , 0 . 6% ± 0 . 4 for R086ctrlp=0 . 968 , 0 . 5% ± 0 . 1 for O141-A and O141-Actrlp = 0 . 899 ) ( Figure 4 , Figure 4—source data 1 ) . To assess the in vitro fitness of the pfk13 mutants relative to the wild-type isogenic lines , we performed a competitive growth assay by co-culturing each pair of mutant and wild-type isogenic parasite lines and measuring the pfk13 allele frequencies over 60 days ( ~30 asexual generations ) . This was achieved using a highly sensitive and robust Taqman allelic discrimination real-time PCR ( qPCR ) assay ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1 , Figure 5—figure supplement 2 , Figure 5—figure supplement 1—source data 1 , Figure 5—figure supplement 2—source data 1 ) that was able to accurately quantify the different proportions of the mutant alleles in these samples . Results showed a modest growth deficit in pfk13 mutants compared to the wild-type parent for both the R086 and O141-A lines , suggesting that the pfk13 C580Y and R539T mutations negatively impact parasite growth . Over the 60 day period , we observed an 18% reduction in the frequency of the R539T mutant for the R086 line , and larger significant reductions of 24% and 40% in allele frequencies of the C580Y mutants of R086 and O141-A compared to their respective isogenic wild-type counterparts ( Figure 5a , Figure 5—source data 1 ) . This reflected an average reduced growth rate of −0 . 6% , −0 . 8% and −1 . 3% per 48 hr generation of the R086R539T , R086C580Y and O141-AC580Y mutant lines , respectively , across 30 generations ( Figure 5b , Figure 5—source data 1 ) . In addition to observing that the C580Y mutation conferred a higher fitness cost compared to the R539T mutation , we also saw that the parasite genetic background contributed to the severity of the fitness deficit , as the growth defect in the C580Y mutation was substantially more pronounced in O141-A compared with R086 parasites ( Figure 5 , Figure 5—source data 1 ) . 3 Discussion Results presented herein confirm the de novo emergence and long-term persistence of the pfk13 C580Y artemisinin resistance mutation in Guyana , South America . Six years after their first identification , pfk13 C580Y mutant parasites continue to circulate in Guyana at low prevalence ( 1 . 6%; 14/854 ) . Parasites bearing this mutation belong to a single clonal lineage and are of autochthonous origin . Gene editing studies on French Guianan parasites , closely related to parasites from Guyana , showed that the pfk13 C580Y mutation is able to mediate artemisinin resistance in vitro at levels observed in Southeast Asian parasites harboring this mutation . An adverse impact of this pfk13 mutation on asexual blood stage growth rates of pfk13-edited French Guianan parasite lines in culture was also observed , providing evidence of a fitness cost similar to that previously described for Southeast Asian lines ( Nair et al . , 2018; Li et al . , 2019 ) . During the 1990s , analyses of resistant parasites retrospectively suggested the simultaneous emergence of resistance to chloroquine and sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine in parasites from Southeast Asia and the Amazonian region of South America ( Wootton et al . , 2002; Roper et al . , 2004; Vinayak et al . , 2010 ) . With artemisinin , the same scenario is occurring with evidence of an independent emergence of resistance mutation in South America . For artemisinin resistance , there is an opportunity to dissect the first steps of resistance selection in South America in ‘real time’ , relying on genetic markers and phenotypic assays ( genotypic surveys , therapeutic efficacy studies , and in vitro phenotyping through the Ring-stage Survival Assay ( RSA0-3h ) ) developed in Southeast Asia ( Ariey et al . , 2014; Witkowski et al . , 2013 ) . These genetic and phenotypic tools can help address the critical questions of why in vitro resistance to artemisinin has emerged in Region 1 in Guyana , a country with fewer than 20 , 000 malaria cases in 2018 , and why this resistance is not increasing more quickly . In 2004 , Guyana was one of the first South American malaria-endemic countries to adopt and implement artemether-lumefantrine ( Coartem ) , the current first-line therapy against P . falciparum . Six years later , in 2010 , pfk13 C580Y mutants were first identified . Until now , no further signals of artemisinin resistance or pfk13 mutations had been identified , despite studies incorporating pfk13 genotyping in Guyana ( n = 50 ) , Suriname ( n = 40 ) and French Guiana ( n = 198 ) ( Rahman et al . , 2016; Ménard et al . , 2016; Chenet et al . , 2017 ) . Other than pfk13 C580Y , no other pfk13 propeller domain mutations have been observed in Guyana . In Southeast Asia , two molecular epidemiological profiles are currently observed . In Western Cambodia , one C580Y linage ( KEL1 ) has displaced other mutations and has rapidly become the dominant pfk13 genotype in that population ( >80% ) ( Amato et al . , 2018; Takala-Harrison et al . , 2015 ) . This lineage has merged with a multicopy plasmepsin 2 and 3 lineage ( PLA1 ) that is associated with piperaquine resistance ( Amato et al . , 2018 ) . Nowadays , this co-lineage has colonized northeastern Thailand and southern Laos ( Imwong et al . , 2017 ) . On the other side , in western Thailand , at the border with Myanmar , a six-year period was required for distinct mutant pfk13 parasite lineages to collectively reach a population prevalence of 20% ( Amato et al . , 2018; Anderson et al . , 2017 ) . At the present time , a patchwork of pfk13 genotypes co-circulates in that population and the prevalence of C580Y lineages fluctuates around 20–30% ( Kobasa et al . , 2018 ) . In Myanmar , pfk13 mutants are more diverse and the F446I mutation presently dominates the pfk13 mutant parasite population in certain sites , with this mutation being associated with an intermediate resistance phenotype ( Han et al . , 2020; Bonnington et al . , 2017 ) . Given this history of pfk13 propeller domain mutations in Southeast Asia , beginning with a soft sweep and transitioning to a hard sweep , we might have expected an increase in the prevalence of pfk13 C580Y mutant parasites during this 2010-2016/2017 period in Guyana . However , the situation in this part of the world differs from Southeast Asia . First , efforts to monitor pfk13 mutations in Guyana were not systematically conducted between 2010 and 2017 . Sample size could therefore explain why the C580Y mutation was only sporadically observed . Nonetheless , the present study indicates that the mutation has not drastically increased in the parasite population . Differences in the resistance profile to artemisinin partner drugs could also account for the heterogeneity in pfk13 mutational trajectories in Southeast Asia vs . Guyana , a region where markers of resistance have historically reached fixation ( Pelleau et al . , 2015; Legrand et al . , 2012 ) . In Southeast Asia , the rapid spread of artemisinin-resistant genomic lineages can be explained in part by a multidrug-resistant profile , which includes pfk13 variants as well as mutations conferring resistance to the partner drug piperaquine ( Amato et al . , 2018; Ross et al . , 2018; Kim et al . , 2019 ) . Our genomic analysis of a panel of Guyanese isolates identified the common South American profile for known drug resistance markers ( pfcrt , pfdhps , pfdhfr and pfmdr1 ) in both mutant and wild-type pfk13 samples ( Wootton et al . , 2002; Roper et al . , 2004; Vinayak et al . , 2010; Legrand et al . , 2012 ) . In the Guiana Shield , lumefantrine remains a highly effective partner drug for artemisinin , and no mutations or phenotypes associated with lumefantrine resistance have been observed ( Legrand et al . , 2012 ) . High efficacy of the partner drug could therefore be an important factor limiting the spread of pfk13 C580Y in Guyana . Finally , both the low synonymous pairwise genetic diversity ( πsyn = 3 . 4 x 10−4 ) and the low complexity of infection ( COI , 2 . 2% of samples with a COI > 1 ) in Guyana are in keeping with the expectation that the P . falciparum population in South America is smaller and more recently established than in Southeast Asia ( Yalcindag et al . , 2012 ) . The genomic structure of the Guyana parasite population could also help explain why the mutation arose there , rather than other settings in South America . The present findings indicate high outcrossing rates and few clonal lineages in Guyana ( 0 . 54% pairs with IBD >0 . 75 ) . This clonal diversity is relatively high , especially within a South American context . Previous studies have found much higher proportions of non-unique haplotype backgrounds ( >30% of samples ) within parasite populations from Colombia ( Echeverry et al . , 2013 ) , Peru ( Dharia et al . , 2010 ) , and Ecuador ( Sáenz et al . , 2015; Sáenz et al . , 2017 ) . These prior analyses used fewer genomic markers , but the results still suggest that clonal diversity may be greater in the Guiana Shield relative to the rest of the continent , possibly driven by the high P . falciparum transmission level observed in mining areas ( Douine et al . , 2016; Ministry of Public Health , 2018 ) . As genomic background likely plays a key role in the persistence of resistance mutations like C580Y , this haplotype richness may increase the likelihood that resistance mutations can successfully establish themselves in a permissive background . Subsequently , a low recombination rate may allow these beneficial combinations to then persist within the population . A more definitive exploration of this hypothesis , and of whether Guyana’s current clonal structure represents recent demographic change or historic population subdivision , will be possible as more whole-genome sequence data become available for the continent . The slower trajectory of pfk13 C580Y may also be due to an impaired asexual blood-stage growth rate , and the absence of compensatory mutations that have been hypothesized to aid the spread of the C580Y mutation in Southeast Asia ( Amato et al . , 2018; Li et al . , 2019 ) . We chose to introduce two pfk13 mutations by gene editing: C580Y mutation because of its presence in Guyana and its dominance in Southeast Asia , and R539T as a positive control for in vitro resistance , as it exhibits the highest RSA observed in Southeast Asian strains along with I543T ( Ariey et al . , 2014; Straimer et al . , 2015 ) . Introducing these mutations conferred high levels of in vitro artemisinin resistance and both mutations negatively impacted growth rates in vitro in our parasite isolates from French Guiana , a neighboring country of Guyana . These growth rate differences provide a surrogate marker of fitness and do not necessarily predict in vivo success of the mutations , as multiple other parameters are also important including gametocyte production , impacts on transmission , and immunity . Our data show that the C580Y mutation was associated with a more severe growth defect compared to the R539T mutation in these asexual blood stage parasites . A similar finding was also recently reported in C580Y-edited isolates from the Thailand-Myanmar border ( Nair et al . , 2018 ) , although disparate results were obtained for C580Y-edited isolates from Cambodia ( Straimer et al . , 2017 ) . These contrasting data underline the influence of the parasite’s genomic background , which potentially involves compensatory mutations that impact the overall growth . Further studies will be needed to screen for potential secondary mutations that may be offsetting these fitness costs . It will also be important to examine factors that could drive the persistence of mutant pfk13 in Guyana despite the apparent fitness cost , including a consideration of local antimalarial drug usage and quality , transmission levels , and population movement . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) has categorized countries regarding artemisinin resistance based on pfk13 mutant prevalence and the clinical response to artemisinin derivatives ( World Health Organization , 2017 ) . The threshold of 5% of pfk13 mutants has been met on several occasions in Guyana , first in 2010 ( Chenet et al . , 2016 ) , then punctually in 2016–2017 in Region 1 . The situation is evolving and a marker could disappear for reasons that are currently unclear . Nonetheless , in light of these findings , Guyana has the status of suspected resistance to artemisinin derivatives ( World Health Organization , 2017 ) . The clinical and public health significance of the presence of these mutations on the therapeutic efficacy of artemisinin-based combination therapies in Guyana , and more precisely artemether/lumefantrine - first line in the country , should be directly evaluated . We note that our study had limitations including the small number of analyzed samples and the in vitro phenotypic impact evaluated in parasites from nearby French Guiana and not Guyana itself . Nonetheless , we observed that pfk13 mutants still circulated in 2016–2017 . Given their decreased susceptibility to DHA in vitro , these mutants are likely to expose the partner drug to the risk of emerging resistance . This situation could defeat P . falciparum elimination strategies in this region . Therefore , national health authorities should continue to work together in order to overcome difficulties coming from their multiplicity of regulations , malaria control strategies and transmission levels in the context of major human migrations across borders . The Guiana Shield initiative launched by the Pan American Health Organization ( PAHO ) and the WHO in 2016 will have a crucial role to reinforce and to coordinate the different malaria control measures . 4 Materials and methods In collaboration with PAHO , 854 P . falciparum isolates were collected in Guyana from March 2016 to September 2017 in febrile individuals visiting the malaria clinic . Parasites associated with these samples came mainly from Region 1 ( n = 114 ) , 7 ( n = 572 ) and 8 ( n = 150 ) ( Figure 1 , Figure 1—source data 1 ) . Those are the three main endemic regions for malaria in the country . Sample collection was done in patients who provided informed consent . As part of molecular surveillance established in the country , consent from the patients was not required and filter papers were collected at the diagnosis time in different clinics and hospital of the country . DNA was extracted from dried blood spots using the QIAmp DNA mini kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol ( Qiagen , Germany ) . The pfk13 gene of each sample was amplified by nested PCR using published primers ( Ariey et al . , 2014; Menard and Ariey , 2013 ) . For the primary PCR , 1 µl of DNA was amplified in a Mastermix containing: 1X of HOT FIREPol Blend Master Mix Ready to Load ( 12 . 5 mM MgCl2 , Solis BioDyne ) , 3 . 5 mM MgCl2 , and 0 . 2 µM of each primer to a final volume of 25 µl . The amplification program was: 15 min at 95°C , then 35 cycles of 30 s at 95°C , 2 min at 60°C , 2 min at 72°C , and a final extension of 10 min at 72°C . For the nested PCR , 1 µl of primary PCR product was amplified under the same conditions with the following program: 15 min at 95°C , then 40 cycles of 30 s at 95°C , 1 min at 60°C , 1 min at 72°C , and a final extension of 10 min at 72°C . Nested PCR products were detected using 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining . Double-strand sequencing was performed by Eurofins ( France ) . Sequences were aligned with Geneious v8 . 1 . 7 using the 3D7 pfk13 sequence as a reference . Mutant isolates were analyzed twice to confirm results . The analysis of eight microsatellite loci located upstream ( −31 . 9 , –6 . 36 , −3 . 74 , –0 . 15 kb ) and downstream ( 3 . 4 , 8 . 6 , 15 . 1 , 72 . 3 kb ) of the pfk13 gene within isolates from Guyana was performed as previously described ( Chenet et al . , 2016; Cheeseman et al . , 2012; Talundzic et al . , 2015 ) . Parasites were cultured in human red blood cells in enriched RPMI medium containing 10% human serum and were propagated at 37°C in 10% O2 , 5% CO2 and 85% N2 . The enriched medium is composed of RPMI-1640 ( ref 4130 , Sigma Aldrich ) with HEPES [25 mM] , L-glutamine [5 mM] , glucose [22 mM] , NaHCO35% [25 mM] , gentamycin [20 mM] , hypoxanthine [0 . 37 mM] and orotic acid [1 . 6 µM] . Two P . falciparum isolates collected in French Guiana in 2011 ( O141-A ) and 2014 ( R086 ) were genetically modified using the ZFN method as previously described ( Straimer et al . , 2015 ) . Briefly , donor plasmids ( pZFN-K13-18/20-hDHFR-bsmut carrying the wild-type pfk13 allele and pZFN-K13-18/20-hDHFR-C580Y and pZFN-K13-18/20-hDHFR-R539T carrying the mutated pfk13 allele ) were purified from XL10-Gold bacteria using the QIAGEN plasmid Maxi kit ( ref12162 ) and resuspended in Cytomix . Parasites were electroporated with 50 µg of donor plasmid using the Biorad Gene-PulserII electroporator with settings of 0 . 31 kV and 950 µF ( Fidock and Wellems , 1997 ) . The day after electroporation and for 6 days , parasites were exposed to 2 . 5 nM WR99210 ( a gift from Jacobus Pharmaceuticals , Princeton , NJ ) . Between 20–35 days after electroporation , parasites were detectable by microscopy . To check plasmid integration into parasites , DNA was extracted from bulk culture with the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit ( Qiagen ) and was PCR amplified using primers p16 ( 5’-GCTAATAAGTAATATCAATATAAGGG-3’ ) and p17 ( 5’-GGTATTAAATTTTTACCATTCCCATTAGTATTTTGTATAGG-3’ ) . Sequencing was done by Eurofins with the p16 primer and sequences were analyzed using Geneious v8 . 1 . 7 . Edited parasites were cloned by limiting dilution and selected after 3 weeks by lactate dehydrogenase assay using Malstat reagent ( Goodyer and Taraschi , 1997; Adjalley et al . , 2010 ) . Selected clones were pfk13 genotyped . Parental and pfk13-edited parasites were phenotyped using the Ring-stage Survival Assay ( RSA0-3h ) method as previously described ( Witkowski et al . , 2013 ) . RSA0-3h were performed independently three times for each line . The pfk13 I543T-mutant IPC4912 strain ( MRA1241 ) was used as an artemisinin-resistant control . RSA0-3h was interpretable if the initial parasitemia was greater than 0 . 25% and if the growth rate was greater than two-fold per 48 hr . Statistical significance between survival rates of the different lines were calculated using Student’s t-test . Fitness assays were performed by inoculating an equal number of wild-type and mutant isogenic ring-stage parasites in a 6 ml culture at an initial parasitemia of 1% . Each co-culture experiment was performed in duplicate on two independent occasions and monitored for 60 days . Saponin-lysed parasite pellets of each co-culture were harvested every two days during 60 days and genomic DNA was extracted using the QIAmp DNA mini kit . The percentage of wild-type or mutant allele in each co-culture was determined using genomic DNA in a TaqMan Allelic Discrimination Real-Time PCR Assays . Wilcoxon signed-rank test was applied to test for statistical significance in the observed percentage of the pfk13 mutant allele in each of the individual paired co-cultures against an expected no change in the percentage of the mutant . Primers ( forward and reverse ) and TaqMan fluorescence-labeled MGB probes ( Eurofins , Germany ) for real-time quantitative PCR ( qPCR ) were designed to specifically detect the pfk13 propeller mutations R539T and C580Y , or the ZFN silent binding mutations , in parasites . The sequences of the forward and reverse primers , and probes ( FAM and HEX probe ) are shown in Supplementary file 4 . We first determined the efficiency and sensitivity of amplifying the pfk13 allele in real-time PCR assays using standard curves comprising 10-fold serially diluted DNA templates ranging from 10 ng to 0 . 001 ng . Robustness was demonstrated by high efficiency ( 88–95% ) and R2 values ( 0 . 98–1 . 00 ) ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1a and b , Figure 5—figure supplement 1—source data 1 ) . Next , we tested the quantitative accuracy in genotype calling by performing multiplex qPCR assays using a pre-defined set of mixtures containing plasmids expressing wild-type to mutant alleles in fixed ratios ( 0:100 , 20:80 , 40:60 , 50:50 , 60:40 , 80:20 , 100:0 ) . The triplicate points clustered tightly , indicating high reproducibility in the data across the fitted curve ( linear polynomial order = 2 , R2 = 0 . 92 to 0 . 94 ) ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1c and d , Figure 5—figure supplement 1—source data 1 ) . Hence , our assay was able to accurately quantify the different proportions of the mutant alleles in these pre-mixed samples . For a single set of samples , we ran the qPCR on two separate occasions to test the consistency of amplification between runs . The results showed excellent correlations ( Figure 5—figure supplement 2a , Figure 5—figure supplement 2—source data 1 ) , and thus we concluded that it was not necessary to perform qPCR in replicate runs for each sample . Nevertheless , we always included three replicate qPCR reactions per sample in every run . The data showed consistently high correlations between independent sampling experiments ( Figure 5—figure supplement 2b , Figure 5—figure supplement 2—source data 1 ) . Purified DNA templates were amplified with a species-specific primer set and the corresponding probe . Briefly , the qPCR reactions for every sample were run in triplicates consisting of 1x QuantiFAST reaction mix containing ROX reference dye ( Qiagen , Germany ) , 0 . 66 µM of forward and reverse primers , 0 . 16 µM each of the FAM-MGB and HEX-MGB TaqMan probes , and 10 ng of genomic DNA . Amplification and detection of fluorescence was carried out on the QuantStudio 3 ( Applied Biosystems , USA ) using the genotyping assay mode with the following cycling conditions: 30 s at 60°C , 5 min at 95°C to activate the enzyme , and 40 cycles of 30 s at 95°C , 30 s at 60°C , and 30 s at 60°C and post-read out at 60°C for 30 s . The final optimized assays always included a positive control of plasmid expressing the mutant or wild-type allele in every PCR reaction to ensure the reaction was successful and a no template control of water as a negative control . The software analyzed the background fluorescence level and calculated background normalized media dye fluorescence ( ΔRn ) as a function of cycle number for the wild-type or mutant allele . To determine the wild-type or mutant allele frequency in each sample , we first confirmed the presence of the allele by only taking values where the Ct of sample was less than that of the no template control minus three cycles . Next , we subtracted the sample’s ΔRn from the background ( control plasmid: absence of wild-type or mutant expressing allele ) and normalized to 100% ( control plasmid: 100% wild-type or mutant expressing allele ) to obtain the percentage of mutant and wild-type allele . Then we calculated the average of ( mutant and 100% - wild-type ) to derive the percentage of mutant allele . For the Guyana samples , we performed selective whole-genome amplification ( SWGA ) on DNA samples as previously described ( Oyola et al . , 2016 ) to enrich parasite DNA prior to sequencing on an Illumina HiSeqX instrument at the Broad Institute . We used the enriched DNA to construct Illumina sequencing libraries from the amplified material using the Nextera XT library kit ( catalog no . FC-131–1002 ) . We aligned reads to the P . falciparum v3 reference genome assembly using BWA-MEM ( Li , 2013 ) and called SNPs and INDELs using the GATK HaplotypeCaller ( Van der Auwera et al . , 2013; McKenna et al . , 2010; DePristo et al . , 2011 ) according to the best practices for P . falciparum as determined by the Pf3K consortium ( https://www . malariagen . net/projects/pf3k ) . Analyses were limited to the callable segments of the genome ( Miles et al . , 2016 ) and excluded sites where over 20% of samples were heterozygous . Additional BAM files for comparative analyses among populations were downloaded from the Pf3k project ( release 5; www . malariagen . net/projects/pf3k ) . For each of four countries in Africa ( Democratic Republic of Congo , Ghana , Guinea , and Malawi ) and two countries in Southeast Asia ( Cambodia and Thailand ) , 50 samples were chosen based on their high coverage ( greatest number of sites with at least 10 × coverage ) . We calculated pairwise identity by descent ( IBD ) using a hidden Markov model ( hmmIBD ) ( Schaffner et al . , 2018 ) . Samples with a missing call rate >0 . 7 were excluded from the analysis . We conducted PCA analyses using R ( R Development Core Team , 2016 ) after removing samples that showed high relatedness ( IBD >0 . 5 ) to another sample with higher sequencing coverage . Pairwise nucleotide diversity was calculated using a custom Perl script ( Source Code File 1 , Source Code File 2 , Source Code File 3 ) . All genomic analyses were limited to samples containing only a single clonal lineage , as determined by THE REAL McCOIL ( Chang et al . , 2017 ) or as identified by the Pf3K consortium ( Zhu et al . , 2019 ) ."}

Watching how proteins move and interact within a living cell can help scientists to better understand these biological mechanisms . Single-particle tracking is a recent technique that makes these observations possible by taking ‘live’ recordings of individual proteins in a cell . Typically , the goal of a single-particle tracking experiment is to assign proteins into groups , or subpopulations , based on the way they move in the cell . For example , one subpopulation may be bound to other cellular structures , a second moving freely at a high speed , and a third diffusing slowly . This informs on the biological roles of the proteins . The method involves an experimental stage and an analysis stage . During the experiment , proteins of interest are labeled with a small dye molecule that produces light when excited by a laser . The laser then illuminates the cell , stimulating all the labels in a thin layer . The position of each molecule is then determined with a microscope and a ‘snapshot’ taken . By repeating this process over multiple images , the movement of each molecule over time can be tracked . However , experimental problems can make the interpretation difficult . Motion blurring takes place when the proteins move so fast they appear as blurs in the images; tracking errors happen when so many proteins are present in the same space their trajectories overlap . Here , Hansen , Woringer et al . combine two pre-existing methods to improve the experimental set-up . Using lasers that flash like a strobe light reduces motion blurring by essentially taking snapshots of the proteins at short time intervals . Tracking errors are addressed by a technique whereby only one protein at a time produces light . Once the images are obtained and analyzed to yield trajectories , the trajectories themselves need to be analyzed to determine the number and properties of the protein subpopulations . Several factors can skew this analysis stage . For example , there is often a bias against fast-moving particles because the laser only lights up a thin layer of the cell . The proteins travelling slowly stay in focus long enough to be detected across many images; the fast ones quickly move out of the layer and are therefore counted less often . Hansen , Woringer et al . designed a free and user-friendly algorithm package called Spot-On to correct for this issue . Spot-On was thoroughly benchmarked against other solutions , demonstrating both its accuracy and robustness . Single-particle tracking can lead to misleading results if used incorrectly . It is essential to publically share solutions that help make this technique more rigorous , especially since a growing number of scientists have already started to use the method .", "article": "1 Introduction Advances in imaging technologies , genetically encoded tags and fluorophore development have made single-particle tracking ( SPT ) an increasingly popular method for analyzing protein dynamics ( Liu et al . , 2015 ) . Recent biological applications of SPT have revealed that transcription factors ( TFs ) bind mitotic chromosomes ( Teves et al . , 2016 ) , how Polycomb interacts with chromatin ( Zhen et al . , 2016 ) , that ‘pioneer factor’ TFs bind chromatin dynamically ( Swinstead et al . , 2016 ) , that TF binding time correlates with transcriptional activity ( Loffreda et al . , 2017 ) and that different nuclear proteins adopt distinct target search mechanisms ( Izeddin et al . , 2014; Rhodes et al . , 2017 ) . Compared with indirect and bulk techniques such as Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching ( FRAP ) or Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy ( FCS ) , SPT is often seen as less biased and less model-dependent ( Goulian and Simon , 2000; Mueller et al . , 2013; Shen et al . , 2017 ) . In particular , SPT makes it possible to directly follow single molecules over time in live cells and has provided clear evidence that proteins often exist in several subpopulations that can be characterized by their distinct diffusion coefficients ( Mueller et al . , 2013; Shen et al . , 2017 ) . For example , nuclear proteins such as TFs and chromatin binding proteins typically show a quasi-immobile chromatin-bound fraction and a freely diffusing fraction inside the nucleus . However , while SPT of slow-diffusing membrane proteins is an established technology ( Weimann et al . , 2013 ) , 2D-SPT of proteins freely diffusing inside a 3D nucleus introduces several biases that must be corrected for in order to obtain accurate estimates of subpopulations . First , while a frame is acquired , fast-diffusing molecules move and spread out their emitted photons over multiple pixels causing a ‘motion-blur’ artifact ( Berglund , 2010; Deschout et al . , 2012; Frost et al . , 2012; Goulian and Simon , 2000; Izeddin et al . , 2014 ) , whereas immobile or slow-diffusing molecules resemble point spread functions ( PSFs; Figure 1A ) . This results in under-counting of the fast-diffusing subpopulation . Second , high particle densities tend to cause tracking errors when localized molecules are connected into trajectories . This can result in incorrect displacement estimates ( Figure 1B ) . Third , since SPT generally employs 2D imaging of 3D motion , immobile or slow-diffusing molecules will generally remain in-focus until they photobleach and therefore exhibit long trajectories , whereas fast-diffusing molecules in 3D rapidly move out-of-focus , thus resulting in short trajectories ( we refer to this as ‘defocalization’; Figure 1C ) . This results in a time-dependent under-counting of fast-diffusing molecules ( Goulian and Simon , 2000; Kues and Kubitscheck , 2002 ) . Fourth , SPT analysis methods themselves may introduce biases; to avoid this , an accurate and validated method is needed ( Figure 1D ) . Here , we introduce an integrated approach to overcome all four biases . The first two biases must be minimized at the data acquisition stage and we describe an experimental SPT method to do so ( spaSPT ) , whereas the latter two can be overcome using a previously developed kinetic modeling framework ( Hansen et al . , 2017; Mazza et al . , 2012 ) now extended and implemented in Spot-On . Spot-On is available as a web-interface ( https://SpotOn . berkeley . edu ) as well as Python and Matlab packages . 2 Results Spot-On is a user-friendly web-interface that pedagogically guides the user through a series of quality-checks of uploaded datasets consisting of pooled single-molecule trajectories . It then performs kinetic model-based analysis that leverages the histogram of molecular displacements over time to infer the fraction and diffusion constant of each subpopulation ( Figure 2 ) . Spot-On does not directly analyze raw microscopy images , since a large number of localization and tracking algorithms exist that convert microscopy images into single-molecule trajectories ( for a comparison of particle tracking methods , see ( Chenouard et al . , 2014 ) ; moreover , Spot-On can be one-click interfaced with TrackMate ( Tinevez et al . , 2017 ) , which allows inspection of trajectories before uploading to Spot-On ) . To use Spot-On , a user uploads their SPT trajectory data in one of several formats ( Figure 2 ) . Spot-On then generates useful meta-data for assessing the quality of the experiment ( e . g . localization density , number of trajectories etc . ) . Spot-On also allows a user to upload multiple datasets ( e . g . different replicates ) and merge them . Spot-On then calculates and displays histograms of displacements over multiple time delays . The next step is model fitting . Spot-On models the distribution of displacements for each subpopulation using Brownian motion under steady-state conditions without state transitions ( full model description in Materials and Methods ) . Spot-On also accounts for localization errors ( either user-defined or inferred from the SPT data ) . Crucially , Spot-On corrects for defocalization bias ( Figure 1C ) by explicitly calculating the probability that molecules move out-of-focus as a function of time and their diffusion constant ( Video 1 ) . In fact , Spot-On uses the gradual loss of freely diffusing molecules over time as additional information to infer the diffusion constant and size of each subpopulation . Spot-On considers either 2 or 3 subpopulations . For instance , TFs in nuclei can generally exist in both a chromatin-bound state characterized by slow diffusion and a freely diffusing state associated with rapid diffusion . In this case , a 2-state model is generally appropriate ( ‘bound’ vs . ‘free’ ) . Spot-On allows a user to choose their desired model and parameter ranges and then fits the model to the data . Using the previous example of TF dynamics , this allows the user to infer the bound fraction and the diffusion constants . Finally , once a user has finished fitting an appropriate model to their data , Spot-On allows easy download of publication-quality figures and relevant data ( Figure 2; Full tutorial in Supplementary file 1 ) . We first evaluated whether Spot-On could accurately infer subpopulations ( Figure 1D ) and successfully account for known biases ( Figure 1C ) using simulated data . We compared Spot-On to a popular alternative approach of first fitting the mean square displacement ( MSD ) of individual trajectories of a minimum length and then fitting the distribution of estimated diffusion constants ( we refer to this as ‘MSDi’ ) as well as a sophisticated Hidden-Markov Model-based Bayesian inference method ( vbSPT ) ( Persson et al . , 2013 ) . Since most SPT data is collected using highly inclined illumination ( Tokunaga et al . , 2008 ) ( HiLo ) , we simulated TF binding and diffusion dynamics ( 2-state model: ‘bound vs . free’ ) confined inside a 4 µm radius mammalian nucleus under realistic HiLo SPT experimental settings subject to a 25 nm localization error ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) . We considered the effect of the exposure time ( 1 ms , 4 ms , 7 ms , 13 ms , 20 ms ) , the free diffusion constant ( from 0 . 5 µm²/s to 14 . 5 µm²/s in 0 . 5 µm²/s increments ) and the bound fraction ( from 0% to 95% in 5% increments ) yielding a total of 3480 different conditions that span the full range of biologically plausible dynamics ( Figure 3—figure supplements 2–3; Appendix 1 ) . Spot-On accurately inferred subpopulation sizes with minimal error ( Figure 3A–B , Table 1 ) , but slightly underestimated the diffusion constant ( −4 . 8%; Figure 3B; Table 1 ) . However , this underestimate was due to particle confinement inside the nucleus: Spot-On correctly inferred the diffusion constant when the confinement was relaxed ( Figure 3—figure supplement 4; 20 µm nuclear radius instead of 4 µm ) . This emphasizes that diffusion constants measured by SPT inside cells should be viewed as apparent diffusion constants . In contrast , the MSDi method failed under most conditions regardless of whether all trajectories were used ( MSDi ( all ) ) or a fitting filter applied ( MSDi ( R2 >0 . 8 ) ; Figure 3A–B; Table 1 ) . vbSPT performed almost as well as Spot-On for slow-diffusing proteins , but showed larger deviations for fast-diffusing proteins ( Figure 3—figure supplements 2–3 ) . To illustrate how the methods could give such divergent results when run on the same SPT data , we considered two example simulations ( Figure 3C–D; more examples in Figure 3—figure supplement 3 ) . First , we considered a mostly bound and relatively slow diffusion case ( DFREE: 2 . 0 µm²/s; FBOUND: 70%; Δτ: 7 ms; Figure 3C ) . Spot-On and vbSPT accurately inferred both DFREE and FBOUND . In contrast , MSDi ( R2 > 0 . 8 ) greatly underestimated FBOUND ( 13 . 6% vs . 70% ) , whereas MSDi ( all ) slightly overestimated FBOUND . Since MSDi-based methods apply two thresholds ( first , minimum trajectory length: here five frames; second , filtering based on R2 ) in many cases less than 5% of all trajectories passed these thresholds and this example illustrate how sensitive MSDi-based methods are to these thresholds . Note that although we show the fits to the probability density function since this is more intuitive ( PDF; histogram ) , we performed the fitting to the cumulative distribution function ( CDF ) . Second , we considered an example with a slow frame rate and fast diffusion , such that the free population rapidly moves out-of-focus ( DFREE: 14 . 0 µm²/s; FBOUND: 50%; Δτ: 20 ms; Figure 3D ) . Spot-On again accurately inferred FBOUND , and slightly underestimated DFREE due to high nuclear confinement ( Figure 3—figure supplement 4 ) . Although vbSPT generally performed well , because it does not correct for defocalization bias ( vbSPT was developed for bacteria , where defocalization bias is minimal ) , vbSPT strongly overestimated FBOUND in this case ( Figure 3D ) . Consistent with this , Spot-On without defocalization-bias correction also strongly overestimates the bound fraction ( Figure 3—figure supplement 5 ) . We conclude that correcting for defocalization bias is critical . The MSDi-based methods again gave divergent results despite seemingly fitting the data well . Thus , a good fit to a histogram of log ( D ) does not necessarily imply that the inferred DFREE and FBOUND are accurate . A full discussion and comparison of the methods is given in Appendix 1 . Finally , we extended this analysis of simulated SPT data to three states ( one ‘bound’ , two ‘free’ states ) and compared Spot-On and vbSPT . Spot-On again accurately inferred both the diffusion constants and subpopulation fractions of each population and slightly outperformed vbSPT ( Figure 3—figure supplement 6 ) . Having established that Spot-On is accurate , we next tested whether it was also robust . Spot-On’s ability to infer DFREE and FBOUND was robust to misestimates of the axial detection range of ~100–200 nm ( Figure 3—figure supplement 7 ) , was minimally affected by the number of timepoints considered and fitting parameters ( Figure 3—figure supplements 8–9; see also Appendix 2 for parameter considerations ) and was not strongly affected by state changes ( e . g . binding or unbinding ) provided the time-scale of state changes is significantly longer than the frame rate ( Figure 3—figure supplement 10 ) . Moreover , Spot-On inferred the localization error with nanometer precision provided that a significant bound fraction is present ( Figure 3—figure supplement 11 ) . Finally , we sub-sampled the data sets and found that just ~3000 short trajectories ( mean length ~3–4 frames ) were sufficient for Spot-On to reliably infer the underlying dynamics ( Figure 3—figure supplement 12 ) . We conclude that Spot-On is robust . Taken together , this analysis of simulated SPT data suggests that Spot-On successfully overcomes defocalization and analysis method biases ( Figure 1C–D ) , accurately and robustly estimates subpopulations and diffusion constants across a wide range of dynamics and , finally , outperforms other methods . Having validated Spot-On on simulated data , which is not subject to experimental biases ( Figure 1A–B ) , we next sought to evaluate Spot-On on experimental data . To generate SPT data with minimal acquisition bias we performed stroboscopic photo-activation SPT ( spaSPT; Figure 4A ) , which integrates previously and separately published ideas to minimize experimental biases . First , spaSPT minimizes motion-blurring , which is caused by particle movement during the camera exposure time ( Figure 1A ) , by using stroboscopic excitation ( Elf et al . , 2007; Frost et al . , 2012 ) . We found that the bright and photo-stable dyes PA-JF549 and PA-JF646 ( Grimm et al . , 2016a ) in combination with the HaloTag ( ‘Halo’ ) labeling strategy made it possible to achieve a signal-to-background ratio greater than 5 with just 1 ms excitation pulses , thus providing a good compromise between minimal motion-blurring and high signal ( Figure 4B ) . Second , spaSPT minimizes tracking errors ( Figure 1B ) by using photo-activation ( Figure 4A ) ( Grimm et al . , 2016a; Manley et al . , 2008 ) . Tracking errors are generally caused by high particles densities . Photo-activation allows tracking at extremely low densities ( ≤1 molecule per nucleus per frame ) and thereby minimizes tracking errors ( Izeddin et al . , 2014 ) , whilst at the same time generating thousands of trajectories . To consider the full spectrum of nuclear protein dynamics , we studied histone H2B-Halo ( overwhelmingly bound; fast diffusion; Figure 4C ) , Halo-CTCF ( Hansen et al . , 2017 ) ( largely bound; slow diffusion; Figure 4D ) and Halo-NLS ( overwhelmingly free; very fast diffusion; Figure 4F ) in human U2OS cells and Halo-Sox2 ( Teves et al . , 2016 ) ( largely free; intermediate diffusion; Figure 4E ) in mouse embryonic stem cells ( mESCs ) . We labeled Halo-tagged proteins in live cells with the HaloTag ligands PA-JF549 or PA-JF646 ( Grimm et al . , 2016a ) and performed spaSPT using HiLo illumination ( Video 2 ) . To generate a large dataset to comprehensively test Spot-On , we performed 1064 spaSPT experiments across 60 different conditions . First , we studied whether Spot-On could consistently infer subpopulations over a wide range of frame rates . We experimentally determined the axial detection range to be ~700 nm ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) and performed spaSPT at 200 Hz , 167 Hz , 134 Hz , 100 Hz , 74 Hz and 50 Hz using the four cell lines . Spot-On consistently inferred the diffusion constant ( Figure 4G ) and total bound fraction across the wide range of frame rates ( Figure 4H ) . This is notable since all four proteins exhibit apparent anomalous diffusion ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2 ) and this demonstrates that Spot-On is also robust to anomalous diffusion despite modeling Brownian motion . While the ground-truth is unknown when considering experiments , Spot-On gave biologically reasonable results: histone H2B was overwhelmingly bound and free Halo-3xNLS was overwhelmingly unbound ( comparison with vbSPT: Figure 4—figure supplement 3 ) . These results provide additional validation for the bias corrections implemented in Spot-On . We also note that although Spot-On was validated on spaSPT data , SPT data with non-photoactivatable dyes is also suitable for Spot-On analysis provided that the density is sufficiently low to minimize tracking errors ( see also Appendix 3: \"Which datasets are appropriate for Spot-On ? ” ) . Finally , we demonstrated above that just ~3000 short trajectories ( mean length ~3–4 frames ) were sufficient for Spot-On to accurately infer DFREE and FBOUND ( Figure 3—figure supplement 12 ) . Here we obtain well above 3000 trajectories per cell even at ~1 localization/frame . More generally , with spaSPT this should be generally achievable for all but the most lowly expressed nuclear proteins . Thus , this now makes it possible to study biological cell-to-cell variability in TF dynamics . Having validated Spot-On on experimental SPT data , we next applied Spot-On to estimate the effect of motion-blurring on the estimation of subpopulations . As mentioned , since most localization algorithms ( Chenouard et al . , 2014; Sergé et al . , 2008 ) achieve super-resolution through PSF-fitting , this may cause motion-blurred molecules to be undersampled , resulting in a bias towards slow-moving molecules ( Figure 1A ) . We estimated the extent of the bias by imaging the four cell lines at 100 Hz and keeping the total number of excitation photons constant , but varying the excitation pulse duration ( 1 ms , 2 ms , 4 ms , 7 ms , constant; Figure 4I ) . For generality , we performed these experiments using both PA-JF549 and PA-JF646 dyes ( Grimm et al . , 2016a ) . We used Spot-On to fit the data and plotted the apparent free diffusion constant ( Figure 4J ) and apparent total bound fraction ( Figure 4K ) as a function of the excitation pulse duration . For fast-diffusing proteins like Halo-3xNLS and H2B-Halo , motion-blurring resulted in a large underestimate of the free diffusion constant , whereas the effect on slower proteins like CTCF and Sox2 was minor ( Figure 4J ) . Regarding the total bound fraction , motion-blurring caused a ~2 fold overestimate for rapidly diffusing Halo-3xNLS ( Figure 4K ) , but had a minor effect on slower proteins like H2B , CTCF and Sox2 . Similar results were obtained for both dyes for proteins with a significant bound fraction , but we note that JF549 appears to better capture the dynamics of proteins with a minimal bound fraction such as Halo-3xNLS ( Figure 4J–K ) . Finally , we note that the extent of the bias due to motion-blurring will likely be very sensitive to the localization algorithm . Here , using the MTT-algorithm ( Sergé et al . , 2008 ) , motion-blurring caused up to a 2-fold error in both the DFREE and FBOUND estimates . Taken together , these results suggest that Spot-On can reliably be used even for SPT data collected under constant illumination provided that protein diffusion is sufficiently slow and , moreover , provides a helpful guide for optimizing SPT imaging acquisitions ( we include a full discussion of considerations for SPT acquisitions and a proposal for minimum reporting standards in SPT in Appendix 3 and 4 ) . 3 Discussion In summary , SPT is an increasingly popular technique and has been revealing important new biological insight . However , a clear consensus on how to perform and analyze SPT experiments is currently lacking . In particular , 2D SPT of fast-diffusing molecules inside 3D cells is subject to a number of inherent experimental ( Figure 1A–B ) and analysis ( Figure 1C–D ) biases , which can lead to inaccurate conclusions if not carefully corrected for . Here , we introduce approaches for accounting for both experimental and analysis biases . Several methods are available for localization/tracking ( Chenouard et al . , 2014; Sergé et al . , 2008 ) and for classification of individual trajectories ( Monnier et al . , 2015; Persson et al . , 2013 ) . Spot-On now complements these tools by providing a bias-corrected , comprehensive open-source framework for inferring subpopulations and diffusion constants from pooled SPT data and makes this platform available through a convenient web-interface . This platform can easily be extended to other diffusion regimes ( Metzler et al . , 2014 ) and models ( Lee et al . , 2017 ) and , as 3D SPT methods mature , to 3D SPT data . Moreover , spaSPT provides an acquisition protocol for tracking fast-diffusing molecules with minimal bias . We hope that these validated tools will help make SPT more accessible to the community and contribute positively to the emergence of ‘gold-standard’ acquisition and analysis procedures for SPT . 4 Materials and methods Spot-On implements and extends a kinetic modeling framework first described in Mazza et al . ( 2012 ) and later extended in Hansen et al . ( 2017 ) . Briefly , the model infers the diffusion constant and relative fractions of two or three subpopulations from the distribution of displacements ( or histogram of displacements ) computed at increasing lag time ( 1Δτ , 2Δτ , . . . ) . This is performed by fitting a semi-analytical model to the empirical histogram of displacements using non-linear least squares fitting . Defocalization is explicitly accounted for by modeling modeling the fraction of particles that remain in focus over time as a function of their diffusion constant . Mathematically , the evolution over time of a concentration of particles located at the origin as a Dirac delta function and which follows free diffusion in two dimensions with a diffusion constant D can be described by a propagator ( also known as Green’s function ) . Properly normalized , the probability of a particle starting at the origin ending up at a location r = ( x , y ) after a time delay , Δτ , is given by:P ( r , Δτ ) =Nr2DΔτe−r24DΔτ Here N is a normalization constant with units of length . Spot-On integrates this distribution over a small histogram bin window , Δr , to obtain a normalized distribution , the distribution of displacement lengths to compare to binned experimental data . For simplicity , we will therefore leave out N from subsequent expressions . Since experimental SPT data is subject to a significant mean localization error , σ , Spot-On also accounts for this ( Matsuoka et al . , 2009 ) :P ( r , Δτ ) =r2 ( DΔτ+σ2 ) e−r24 ( DΔτ+σ2 ) Many proteins studied by SPT can generally exist in a quasi-immobile state ( e . g . a chromatin-bound state in the case of transcription factors ) and one or more mobile states . We will first consider the 2-state model . Under most conditions , state transitions can be ignored ( ( Hansen et al . , 2017 ) and Figure 3—figure supplement 10 ) . Thus , the steady-state 2-state model considered by Spot-On becomes:P ( r , Δτ ) =FBOUNDr2 ( DBOUNDΔτ+σ2 ) e−r24 ( DBOUNDΔτ+σ2 ) + ( 1−FBOUND ) r2 ( DFREEΔτ+σ2 ) e−r24 ( DFREEΔτ+σ2 ) Here , the quasi-immobile subpopulation has diffusion constant , DBOUND , and makes up a fraction , FBOUND , whereas the freely diffusing subpopulation has diffusion constant , DFREE , and makes up a fraction , FFREE=1-FBOUND . To account for defocalization bias ( Figure 1C ) , Spot-On explicitly considers the probability of the freely diffusing subpopulation moving out of the axial detection range , Δz , during each time delay , Δτ . This is important . For example , only ~25% of freely-diffusing molecules will remain in focus for at least five frames ( assuming Δτ = 10 ms; Δz=700 nm; one gap allowed; D = 5 µm²/s ) , resulting in a 4-fold undercounting if uncorrected for . If we assume absorbing boundaries such that any molecule that contacts the edges of the axial detection range located at zMAX=Δz/2 and zMIN=−Δz/2 is permanently lost , the fraction of freely diffusing molecules with diffusion constant , DFREE , that remain at time delay , Δτ , is given by ( Carslow and Jaeger , 1959; Kues and Kubitscheck , 2002 ) :Premaining ( Δτ , Δz , DFREE ) =1Δz∫−Δz/2Δz/2{1−∑n=0∞ ( −1 ) n[erfc ( ( 2n+1 ) Δz2−z4DFREEΔτ ) +erfc ( ( 2n+1 ) Δz2+z4DFREEΔτ ) ]}dz However , this analytical expression overestimates the fraction lost since there is a significant probability that a molecule that briefly contacted or exceeded the boundary re-enters the axial detection range . The re-entry probability depends on the number of gaps allowed in the tracking ( g ) , Δτ , and Δz and can be approximately accounted for by considering a corrected axial detection range , Δzcorr , larger than Δz: Δzcorr>Δz:Δzcorr ( Δz , Δτ , DFREE , g ) =Δz+a ( Δz , Δτ , g ) DFREE+b ( Δz , Δτ , g ) Although Δzcorr depend on the number of gaps ( g ) allowed in the tracking , we will leave it out for simplicity in the following . We determined the coefficients a and b from Monte Carlo simulations . For a given diffusion constant , D , 50 , 000 molecules were randomly placed one-dimensionally along the z-axis drawn from a uniform distribution from zMIN=−Δz/2 to zMAX=Δz/2 . Next , using a time-step Δτ , one-dimensional Brownian diffusion was simulated along the z-axis using the Euler-Maruyama scheme . For time delays from 1Δτ to 15Δτ , the fraction of molecules that were lost was calculated in the range of D=[1;12] μm2/s . a ( Δz , Δτ , g ) and b ( Δz , Δτ , g ) were then estimated through least-squares fitting of Premaining ( Δτ , Δzcorr , D ) to the simulated fraction remaining . The process was repeated over a grid of plausible values of ( Δz , Δτ , g ) to derive a grid of 134 , 865 ( a , b ) parameter pairs . This pre-calculated library of ( a , b ) parameters enables Spot-On to perform model fitting on nearly any SPT dataset with minimal overhead . Thus , the 2-state model Spot-On uses for kinetic modeling of SPT data is given by:P2 ( r , Δτ ) =FBOUNDr2 ( DBOUNDΔτ+σ2 ) e−r24 ( DBOUNDΔτ+σ2 ) +ZCORR ( Δτ , Δzcorr , DFREE ) ( 1−FBOUND ) r2 ( DFREEΔτ+σ2 ) e−r24 ( DFREEΔτ+σ2 ) where:ZCORR ( Δτ , Δzcorr , DFREE ) =1Δzcorr∫−Δzcorr2Δzcorr2{1−∑n=0∞ ( −1 ) n[erfc ( ( 2n+1 ) Δzcorr2−z4DFREEΔτ ) +erfc ( ( 2n+1 ) Δzcorr2+z4DFREEΔτ ) ]}dz Having derived the 2-state model , generalization to a 3-state model with 1 bound and 2 diffusive states is straightforward . If the three subpopulations have diffusion constants DBOUND , DSLOW , DFAST , and fractions FBOUND , FSLOW , FFAST , such that FBOUND+FSLOW+FFAST=1 , then the 3-state model considered by Spot-On becomes:P3 ( r , Δτ ) =FBOUNDr2 ( DBOUNDΔτ+σ2 ) e−r24 ( DBOUNDΔτ+σ2 ) +ZCORR ( Δτ , Δzcorr , DSLOW ) FSLOWr2 ( DSLOWΔτ+σ2 ) e−r24 ( DSLOWΔτ+σ2 ) +ZCORR ( Δτ , Δzcorr , DFAST ) ( 1−FBOUND−FSLOW ) r2 ( DFASTΔτ+σ2 ) e−r24 ( DFASTΔτ+σ2 ) Where ZCORR ( Δτ , Δzcorr , D ) is as described above . Spot-On calculates the empirical histogram of displacements based on a user-defined bin width . Spot-On allows the user to choose between PDF- and CDF-fitting of the kinetic model to the empirical displacement distributions; CDF-fitting is generally most accurate for smaller datasets and the two are similar for large datasets ( Figure 3—figure supplement 9 ) . The integral in ZCORR ( Δτ , Δzcorr ) was numerically evaluated using the midpoint method over 200 points and the terms of the series computed until the term falls below a threshold of 10−10 . Model fitting and parameter optimization was performed using a non-linear least squares algorithm ( Levenberg-Marquardt ) . Random initial parameter guesses are drawn uniformly from the user-specified parameter range . The optimization is then repeated several times with different initialization parameters to avoid local minima . Spot-On constrains each fraction to be between 0 and 1 and for the sum of the fractions to equal 1 . Although Spot-On performs well on both experimental and simulated SPT data , the model implemented by Spot-On has several limitations . First , the kinetic model assumes diffusion to be ideal Brownian motion , even though it is widely acknowledged that the motion of most proteins inside a cell shows some degree of anomalous diffusion . Nevertheless , Figure 4G–H and Figure 4—figure supplement 2 show that the parameter inference for experimental data of proteins presenting various degrees of anomalous diffusion is quite robust . Second , Spot-On models the localization error as the static mean localization error and this feature can be used to infer the actual localization error from the data . However , the localization error is affected both by the position of the particle with respect to the focal plane ( Lindén et al . , 2017 ) and by motion blur ( Deschout et al . , 2012 ) . Even though a high signal-to-background ratio and fast framerate/stroboscopic illumination help to mitigate these disparities , it is likely that the localization error of fast moving particles will be higher than the bound/slow-moving particles . In that case , one would expect Spot-On to infer a localization error that is the weighted mean of the ‘bound/static’ localization error and the ‘free’ localization error . However , in many situations DfreeΔτ>> σ2 ( even assuming a 2 µm²/s particle imaged at a 5 ms framerate with a ~30 nm localization error , there is still an order of magnitude difference between the two terms ) . As a consequence , the estimate of σ reflects the static localization error ( that is , the localization error of the bound fraction ) , and the localization error estimate becomes less reliable if the bound fraction is very small ( Figure 3—figure supplement 11 ) . Third , following ( Kues and Kubitscheck , 2002 ) the axial detection profile is assumed to be a step function , which is an approximation . However , all simulations here were performed using a detection profile with Gaussian edges ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) and as shown in Figure 3A–B Spot-On still works quite well and moreover is relatively robust to slight mismatches in the axial detection range ( Figure 3—figure supplement 7 ) . Fourth , unlike the original implementation by Mazza et al . ( 2012 ) , Spot-On ignores state transitions . This reduces the number of fitted parameters and simplifies the generalization to more than two states , but as shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 10 it also causes the parameter inference to fail unless the timescale of state changes is at least 10–50 times longer than the frame rate . Thus , in cases where a molecule is known to exhibit state changes on a time-scale of tens to a few hundreds of milliseconds , Spot-On may not be appropriate . Fifth and finally , Spot-On ignores correlations between adjacent displacements , although taking such information into account can potentially improve the parameter inference ( Vestergaard et al . , 2014 ) . Halo-Sox2 ( Teves et al . , 2016 ) knock-in JM8 . N4 mouse embryonic stem cells ( ( Pettitt et al . , 2009 ) Research Resource Identifier: RRID:CVCL_J962; obtained from the KOMP Repository at UC Davis ) were grown on plates pre-coated with a 0 . 1% autoclaved gelatin solution ( Sigma-Aldrich , St . Louis , MO , G9391 ) under feeder free conditions in knock-out DMEM with 15% FBS and LIF ( full recipe: 500 mL knockout DMEM ( ThermoFisher , Waltham , MA , #10829018 ) , 6 mL MEM NEAA ( ThermoFisher #11140050 ) , 6 mL GlutaMax ( ThermoFisher #35050061 ) , 5 mL Penicillin-streptomycin ( ThermoFisher #15140122 ) , 4 . 6 μL 2-mercapoethanol ( Sigma-Aldrich M3148 ) , 90 mL fetal bovine serum ( HyClone Logan , UT , FBS SH30910 . 03 lot #AXJ47554 ) ) and LIF . mES cells were fed by replacing half the medium with fresh medium daily and passaged every two days by trypsinization . Halo-3xNLS , H2B-Halo-SNAP and knock-in C32 Halo-CTCF ( Hansen et al . , 2017 ) Human U2OS osteosarcoma cells ( Research Resource Identifier: RRID:CVCL_0042 ) were grown in low glucose DMEM with 10% FBS ( full recipe: 500 mL DMEM ( ThermoFisher #10567014 ) , 50 mL fetal bovine serum ( HyClone FBS SH30910 . 03 lot #AXJ47554 ) and 5 mL Penicillin-streptomycin ( ThermoFisher #15140122 ) ) and were passaged every 2–4 days before reaching confluency . For live-cell imaging , the medium was identical except DMEM without phenol red was used ( ThermoFisher #31053028 ) . Both mouse ES and human U2OS cells were grown in a Sanyo copper alloy IncuSafe humidified incubator ( MCO-18AIC ( UV ) ) at 37°C/5 . 5% CO2 . Cell lines were pathogen tested and authenticated through STR profiling ( U2OS ) as described previously ( Hansen et al . , 2017; Teves et al . , 2016 ) . All cell lines will be provided upon request . The indicated cell line was grown overnight on plasma-cleaned 25 mm circular no 1 . 5H cover glasses ( Marienfeld , Germany , High-Precision 0117650 ) either directly ( U2OS ) or MatriGel coated ( mESCs; Fisher Scientific , Hampton , NH , #08-774-552 according to manufacturer’s instructions just prior to cell plating ) . After overnight growth , cells were labeled with 5–50 nM PA-JF549 or PA-JF646 ( Grimm et al . , 2016a ) for ~15–30 min and washed twice ( one wash: medium removed; PBS wash; replenished with fresh medium ) . At the end of the final wash , the medium was changed to phenol red-free medium keeping all other aspects of the medium the same . Single-molecule imaging was performed on a custom-built Nikon TI microscope ( Nikon Instruments Inc . , Melville , NY ) equipped with a 100x/NA 1 . 49 oil-immersion TIRF objective ( Nikon apochromat CFI Apo TIRF 100x Oil ) , EM-CCD camera ( Andor , Concord , MA , iXon Ultra 897; frame-transfer mode; vertical shift speed: 0 . 9 μs; −70°C ) , a perfect focusing system to correct for axial drift and motorized laser illumination ( Ti-TIRF , Nikon ) , which allows an incident angle adjustment to achieve highly inclined and laminated optical sheet illumination ( Tokunaga et al . , 2008 ) . The incubation chamber maintained a humidified 37°C atmosphere with 5% CO2 and the objective was also heated to 37°C . Excitation was achieved using the following laser lines: 561 nm ( 1 W , Genesis Coherent , Santa Clara , CA ) for PA-JF549; 633 nm ( 1 W , Genesis Coherent , Pala Alto , CA ) for PA-JF646; 405 nm ( 140 mW , OBIS , Coherent ) for all photo-activation experiments . The excitation lasers were modulated by an acousto-optic Tunable Filter ( AA Opto-Electronic , France , AOTFnC-VIS-TN ) and triggered with the camera TTL exposure output signal . The laser light is coupled into the microscope by an optical fiber and then reflected using a multi-band dichroic ( 405 nm/488 nm/561 nm/633 nm quad-band , Semrock , Rochester , NY ) and then focused in the back focal plane of the objective . Fluorescence emission light was filtered using a single band-pass filter placed in front of the camera using the following filters: PA-JF549: Semrock 593/40 nm bandpass filter; PA-JF646: Semrock 676/37 nm bandpass filter . The microscope , cameras , and hardware were controlled through NIS-Elements software ( Nikon ) . The spaSPT experimental settings for Figure 4G–H were as follows: 1 ms 633 nm excitation ( 100% AOTF ) of PA-JF646 was delivered at the beginning of the frame; 405 nm photo-activation pulses were delivered during the camera integration time ( ~447 μs ) to minimize background and their intensity optimized to achieve a mean density of ≤1 molecule per frame per nucleus . 30 , 000 frames were recorded per cell per experiment . The camera exposure times were: 4 . 5 ms , 5 . 5 ms , 7 ms , 9 . 5 ms , 13 ms and 19 . 5 ms . For the motion-blur spaSPT experiments ( Figure 4I–K ) , the camera exposure was fixed to 9 . 5 ms and photo-activation performed as above . To keep the total number of delivered photons constant , we generated an AOTF-laser intensity calibration curve using a power meter and adjusted the AOTF transmission accordingly for each excitation pulse duration . The excitation settings were as follows: 1 ms , 561 nm 100% AOTF , 633 nm 100% AOTF; 2 ms , 561 nm 43% AOTF , 633 nm 40% AOTF; 4 ms , 561 nm 28% AOTF , 633 nm 27% AOTF; 7 ms , 561 nm 20% AOTF , 633 nm 19% AOTF; constant illumination , 561 nm 17% AOTF , 633 nm 16% AOTF . spaSPT data was analyzed ( localization and tracking ) and converted into trajectories using a custom-written Matlab implementation of the MTT-algorithm ( Sergé et al . , 2008 ) and the following settings: Localization error: 10-6 . 25; deflation loops: 0; Blinking ( frames ) : 1; max competitors: 3; max D ( μm2/s ) : 20 . The spaSPT trajectory data was then analyzed using the Matlab version of Spot-On ( v1 . 0; GitLab tag 1f9f782b ) and the following parameters: dZ = 0 . 7 µm; GapsAllowed = 1; TimePoints: 4 ( 50 Hz ) , 6 ( 74 Hz ) , 7 ( 100 Hz ) , 8 ( 134 Hz ) , 9 ( 167 and 200 Hz ) ; JumpsToConsider = 4; ModelFit = 2; NumberOfStates = 2; FitLocError = 0; LocError = 0 . 035 µm; D_Free_2State=[0 . 4;25]; D_Bound_2State=[0 . 00001;0 . 08]; We developed a utility to simulate diffusing proteins in a confined geometry ( simSPT ) . Briefly , simSPT simulates the diffusion of an arbitrary number of populations of molecules characterized by their diffusion coefficient , under a steady state assumption . Particles are drawn at random between the populations and their location in the 3D nucleus is initialized following a uniform law within the confinement volume . The lifetime of the particle ( in frames ) is also drawn following an exponential law of mean lifetime β . Then , the particle diffuses in 3D until it bleaches . Diffusion is simulated by drawing jumps following a normal law of parameters N ( 0 , 2DΔτ ) , where D is the diffusion coefficient and Δτ the exposure time . Finally , a localization error ( N0 , σ ) is added to each ( x , y , z ) localization in the simulated trajectories . For comparisons of Spot-On , MSDi and vbSPT using a 2-state scenario , we parameterized simSPT to consider two subpopulations of particles diffusing in a sphere ( the nucleus ) of 8 µm diameter illuminated using HiLo illumination ( assuming a HiLo beam width of 4 µm ) , with an axial detection range of ~700 nm , centered at the middle of the HiLo beam with Gaussian edges . Molecules are assumed to have a mean lifetime of 4 frames ( when inside the HiLo beam ) and of 40 frames when outside the HiLo beam . The localization error was set to 25 nm and the simulation was run until 100 , 000 in-focus trajectories were recorded . More specifically , the effect of the exposure time ( 1 ms , 4 ms , 7 ms , 13 ms , 20 ms ) , the free diffusion constant ( from 0 . 5 µm²/s to 14 . 5 µm²/s in 0 . 5 µm²/s increments ) and the fraction bound ( from 0% to 95% in 5% increments ) were investigated , yielding a dataset consisting of 3480 simulations . More details on the simulations , including scripts to reproduce the dataset , are available on GitLab as detailed in the ‘Computer code’ section . Full details on how the simulations were analyzed by Spot-On , vbSPT and MSDi are given in Appendix 1 . We also considered a 3-state scenario featuring a bound subpopulation ( ‘bound’ ) , a relatively slow diffusing free subpopulation ( ‘slow’ ) and a relatively faster diffusing free subpopulation ( ‘free’ ) . In this case , we only compared Spot-On and vbSPT ( Figure 3—figure supplement 6 ) , since the MSDi methods did not perform well . As in the 2-state simulations , we parameterized simSPT to consider that three subpopulations of particles diffusing in a sphere ( the nucleus ) of 8 µm diameter illuminated using HiLo illumination ( assuming a HiLo beam width of 4 µm ) , with an axial detection range of ~700 nm , centered at the middle of the HiLo beam with Gaussian edges . Molecules are assumed to have a mean lifetime of 4 frames ( when inside the HiLo beam ) and of 40 frames when outside the HiLo beam . The localization error was set to 40 nm and the simulation was run until 100 , 000 in-focus trajectories were recorded .

It is caused by mutations in a gene that is crucial for the structure of astrocytes , a type of brain cell whose role is to support neurons . The gene codes for a protein called GFAP , which is made almost exclusively in astrocytes . In Alexander disease , mutated versions of the gene make GFAP collect in disordered clumps or aggregates , which interfere with the astrocytes’ normal activities . All Alexander disease patients develop GFAP aggregates , but the type of mutation they have in the gene for GFAP does not predict how their illness will progress . The age of onset of disease , for example , can vary between less than one year old to more than 70 years old . Battaglia et al . sought to understand how GFAP aggregates form in the cells of Alexander disease patients . One way that GFAP can be altered in the cell is by a process called phosphorylation . Enzymes called kinases add phosphate groups to GFAP , which can regulate the protein’s activity , stability and interactions with other proteins . Battaglia et al . found high levels of phosphorylation at one specific site in the GFAP protein in people who had very early onset of Alexander disease . This phosphorylation was not related to any particular mutation in the gene for GFAP . An added phosphate group at this location in the protein made GFAP more likely to be broken into two pieces by an enzyme called caspase-6 . One of the breakdown products is already known to play a role in aggregation . Young patients with Alexander disease had high levels of GFAP breakdown products and caspase-6 . The phosphorylated protein and this enzyme were found to accumulate in astrocyte aggregates . The findings provide a basis for investigating new strategies to treat Alexander disease that target phosphorylation – as removing or preventing the addition of phosphate groups can be done with drugs . But before exploring how to do this , it will be necessary to find out which enzyme is responsible for phosphorylating GFAP at this particular position . These studies may also give a broader understanding of other GFAP-like proteins ( called intermediate filament proteins ) , which are involved in over 70 human diseases .", "article": "1 Introduction Alexander disease ( AxD ) is a rare and invariably fatal neurological disorder that affects primarily infants and small children , but can also manifest later in life ( Alexander , 1949; Sosunov et al . , 2018; Messing , 2018 ) . Autosomal dominant gain-of-function mutations in GFAP , which encodes glial fibrillary acidic protein ( GFAP ) , cause AxD ( Messing , 2018; Brenner et al . , 2001 ) . GFAP is the major component of the intermediate filament ( IF ) cytoskeleton in astrocytes ( Hol and Pekny , 2015 ) . The accumulation and incorporation of mutant GFAP within cytoplasmic aggregates called Rosenthal fibers ( RFs ) , causes reactive gliosis , leading to secondary injury to neurons and non-neuronal cells ( Olabarria and Goldman , 2017; Wang et al . , 2015; Li et al . , 2018; Jones et al . , 2018 ) . Silencing GFAP via antisense oligonucleotide intervention in vivo eliminates RFs , reverses the stress responses in astrocytes and other cell types , and improves the clinical phenotype in a mouse model of AxD ( Hagemann et al . , 2018 ) . While the utility of GFAP as a key therapeutic target in AxD is clear , the molecular mechanisms for how AxD-associated GFAP missense mutations ( affecting over 70 different residues on GFAP ) lead to defective GFAP proteostasis are not well understood . Deciphering these mechanisms may yield novel interventions , not only for AxD patients , but also for patients with other diseases where IF proteostasis is severely compromised . Normal functioning IFs are stress-bearing structures that organize the cytoplasmic space , scaffold organelles , and orchestrate numerous signaling pathways . In contrast , dysfunctional IFs directly cause or predispose to over 70 tissue-specific or systemic diseases , including neuropathies , myopathies , skin fragility , metabolic dysfunctions , and premature aging ( Omary , 2009; www . interfil . org ) . Disease-associated IF proteins share two key molecular features: abnormal post-translational modifications ( PTMs ) ( Snider and Omary , 2014 ) and pathologic aggregation . The GFAP-rich RF aggregates that are hallmarks of AxD astrocytes bear strong similarities to pathologic aggregates of other IFs , including epidermal keratins ( Coulombe et al . , 1991 ) , simple epithelial keratins ( Nakamichi et al . , 2005 ) , desmin ( Dalakas et al . , 2000 ) , vimentin ( Müller et al . , 2009 ) , neurofilaments ( Zhai et al . , 2007 ) and the nuclear lamins ( Goldman et al . , 2004 ) . There are unique advantages to studying IF proteostasis mechanisms in the context of GFAP because of its restricted cellular expression , homopolymeric assembly mechanism , and because GFAP is the sole genetic cause of AxD as a direct result of its toxic gain-of-function accumulation and aggregation . Like all IF proteins , GFAP contains three functional domains: amino-terminal ‘head’ domain , central α-helical ‘rod’ domain and carboxy-terminal ‘tail’ domain ( Eriksson et al . , 2009 ) . The globular head domain is essential for IF assembly and disassembly , which are regulated by various PTMs , in particular phosphorylation ( Omary et al . , 2006 ) . It was shown previously that phosphorylation of multiple sites in the head domain of GFAP ( Thr-7 , Ser-8 , Ser-13 , Ser-17 and Ser-34 ) regulates filament disassembly during mitosis and GFAP turnover in non-mitotic cells ( Inagaki et al . , 1990; Takemura et al . , 2002a; Inagaki et al . , 1994; Inagaki et al . , 1996 ) . Additionally , phosphorylation of GFAP has been observed after various injuries of the central nervous system ( CNS ) including kainic acid-induced seizures , cold-injury , and hypoxic-ischemic models , where phosphorylated GFAP is expressed in reactive astrocytes ( Valentim et al . , 1999; Takemura et al . , 2002b; Sullivan et al . , 2012 ) . These observations reveal that phosphorylation of GFAP is important for re-organization of the astrocyte IF cytoskeleton and plasticity in response to injury . However , it is not clear if , and how , abnormal GFAP phosphorylation compromises proteostasis and contributes to AxD pathogenesis . Here , we identified a critical phosphorylation site in the GFAP head domain that is selectively and strongly upregulated in the brain tissues of AxD patients who died very young , independently of the position of the disease mutation that they carried . Further , we show that this site-specific phosphorylation promotes GFAP aggregation and is a marker of perinuclear GFAP aggregates associated with deep nuclear invaginations in AxD patient astrocytes , but not in isogenic control astrocytes . Finally , we demonstrate a correlation between site-specific GFAP phosphorylation and caspase cleavage in cells and in post-mortem brain tissue from AxD patients . Although our study does not establish a causal relationship between GFAP phosphorylation and caspase cleavage , we show that caspase-6 is a new marker for the most severe form of human AxD . Collectively , our results reveal a new PTM signature that is associated with defective GFAP proteostasis in the most severe form of AxD . Future interventional studies targeting these PTMs will determine whether they contribute to , or are the consequence of , disease severity . 2 Results IFs undergo protein synthesis-independent turnover and re-organization to meet cellular demands ( Robert et al . , 2016 ) . PTMs are key in that process , as they regulate filament polymerization and depolymerization , protein-protein interactions , and oligomerization properties of IF proteins ( Snider and Omary , 2014 ) . Of all known PTMs that regulate IFs , phosphorylation is the most ubiquitous and can facilitate or antagonize other types of PTMs via complex cross-talk mechanisms ( Omary et al . , 2006 ) . We hypothesized that AxD-associated GFAP missense mutations ( Figure 1A ) promote GFAP accumulation and aggregation by dysregulating site-specific phosphorylation . We extracted GFAP from post-mortem brain cortex tissue of 13 AxD patients , representing 10 different mutations ( Supplementary file 1 ) and three non-AxD controls ( Supplementary file 2 ) . GFAP from the insoluble high salt extracts ( HSEs ) , prepared according to the procedure described in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 , was used in phospho-proteomic analysis , revealing 12 unique phosphorylation sites on GFAP in AxD ( Figure 1B–C ) . While the AxD-specific phospho-peptides localized to all three functional domains of GFAP ( head , rod , tail ) , the most abundantly phosphorylated residue was a conserved serine ( Ser13 ) in the head domain ( Figure 1C–D ) . Strikingly , we found that the pSer13-GFAP peptide was selectively elevated in the cortex tissue from AxD patients who died very young ( median age at death = 1 . 7 years; range 0 . 5–14 years ) ( Figure 2A ) . Overall , we did not observe significant phosphorylation of GFAP in the control subjects ( Figure 2—source data 1 ) , or in AxD patients who lived 27–50 years ( median age at death = 38 years ) . Further , immunoblot analysis using a phospho-specific antibody ( KT13 ) ( Sekimata et al . , 1996 ) against pSer13-GFAP validated the mass spectrometry results in the AxD patients ( Figure 2B–C ) . Although there was one notable outlier in each age group ( Figure 2B lanes 3 and 11 ) , our results suggest that pSer13-GFAP is primarily associated with the more aggressive , infantile form of AxD . Furthermore , the differences in phosphorylation were not a result of age , since pSer13 GFAP was generally not present in the brain lysates from non-AxD control subjects , regardless of age ( Figure 2D ) . To determine the functional significance of pSer13 on GFAP filament organization , we analyzed the filament properties of non-phosphorylatable ( S13A ) and phospho-mimic ( S13D and S13E ) GFAP mutants . We optimized a transient over-expression system in the SW13 vimentin-negative adrenocarcinoma cells ( SW13vim- ) for this assay , which resulted in primarily filamentous WT GFAP and insoluble aggregated forms of common AxD mutants of GFAP ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) . Compared to wild-type ( WT ) GFAP , the S13D and S13E mutants assembled primarily into large aggregates , similar to the most common AxD-associated mutant R79H-GFAP ( Figure 3A–B ) . S13A formed mostly filaments , although they appeared shorter compared to WT GFAP . To determine if the phospho-mimic mutation directly promotes aggregation , we compared the assembly properties of purified WT , S13A and S13D GFAP ( Figure 3C ) . Consistent with the phenotype observed in the transfected cells , the S13A mutant formed abnormally short filaments in vitro . In contrast , S13D was completely incapable of filament assembly , forming globular structures that were homogeneous in size and not aggregation-prone . Our results with the phospho-deficient and phospho-mimic mutants reveal that S13 is a key site that regulates the assembly properties of GFAP and that its phosphorylation status may modulate the dynamics between filaments and aggregates . In order to explore the function of this phosphorylation event in a disease-relevant system , we used an in vitro human astrocyte model of AxD . We generated iPSCs using fibroblasts from a young AxD patient and characterized their pluripotency by immunofluorescence staining ( Figure 4A ) . Karyotype analysis showed that there were no chromosomal abnormalities due to the reprogramming process ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) . To generate isogenic control cells , we corrected the heterozygous point mutation in GFAP ( c . 715C > T , p . R239C ) using CRISPR/Cas9 mediated gene editing ( Figure 4B ) . Representative chromatograms are shown for the original patient cells and the isogenic controls ( Figure 4C ) . We also isolated ‘CRISPR control’ clones , which were edited on the wild-type GFAP allele , thereby retaining the AxD-causing mutation and serving as an additional disease control for the gene editing procedure . Similar to the original patient cells , the edited cells were karyotyped and characterized for pluripotency ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) . We confirmed that there were no off-target effects due to the editing procedure ( Supplementary file 3 ) . AxD , CRISPR control , and isogenic control iPSCs were differentiated to astrocytes ( iPSC-astrocytes ) via neural progenitor cells ( NPCs ) , as described in the Materials and methods and shown schematically in Figure 4D . After 54 days in culture , iPSC-astrocytes express classical astrocyte markers ( Zhang et al . , 2014 ) , including alcohol dehydrogenase 1 family member L1 ( ALDH1L1 ) , solute carrier family 1 member 3 ( SLC1A3 ) , excitatory amino acid transporter 2 ( EAAT2 ) , Connexin 43 and GFAP ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2 ) . To assess if our model recapitulated key features of AxD , we analyzed total GFAP expression in the iPSC-astrocytes by immunoblot , and found that GFAP levels were significantly higher in the cells that carried the heterozygous GFAP point mutation ( AxD patient and CRISPR control lines ) relative to the isogenic controls ( Figure 4E–F ) . This is consistent with in vivo observations of GFAP levels in AxD patients ( Jany et al . , 2015 ) and mouse models ( Jany et al . , 2013 ) . In addition , high-molecular-mass ( hmm ) GFAP oligomers were present in the AxD iPSC-astrocytes , similar to what we observed when we ectopically expressed the R239C-GFAP mutant ( Figure 5A ) . Finally , we observed by immunofluorescence staining that the AxD mutant iPSC-astrocytes formed both GFAP filaments and perinuclear aggregates ( Figure 5B ) , whereas the isogenic control iPSC-astrocytes formed only GFAP filaments ( Figure 5C ) . In vivo , GFAP antibodies stain the periphery , while DAPI stains the core of RFs ( Der Perng et al . , 2006; Sosunov et al . , 2017 ) . The in vitro-derived AxD iPSC-astrocytes displayed similar characteristics , with RF-like perinuclear aggregates staining positively for GFAP at their periphery and DAPI in the center ( Figure 5B ) . Next , we determined if pSer13-GFAP was present in the AxD iPSC-astrocytes , similar to what we observed in the human brain tissues . As shown in Figure 6A , pSer13-GFAP signal was detected strongly within the core of the perinuclear GFAP aggregates of AxD iPSC-astrocytes . Somewhat surprisingly , we also observed pSer13-GFAP signal in the isogenic control cells , possibly triggered by the in vitro culture conditions . Nevertheless , unlike AxD astrocytes , in the isogenic control astrocytes pSer13-GFAP organization was filamentous and paralleled that of total GFAP . Therefore , the in vitro iPSC-astrocyte model revealed that , only in the presence of the AxD disease mutation , pSer13-GFAP is incorporated within the core of perinuclear inclusions . While in all AxD cells pSer13 signal was detected in the aggregates , we also observed cells with pSer13-positive diffuse cytoplasmic staining and filaments , likely reflecting different states of the GFAP network ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1 ) . Furthermore , the pSer13-positive GFAP aggregates appeared adjacent to prominent nuclear invaginations ( Figure 6A ) . Nuclear deformations , similar to what we observed in the AxD iPSC-astrocytes , are also present in RF-bearing astrocytes in AxD human brain ( Sosunov et al . , 2017 ) . To determine whether the perinuclear aggregates compromised the nuclear envelope , we examined the AxD iPSC-astrocytes by electron microscopy . While we observed filamentous bundles on the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear invaginations , the nuclear envelope appeared intact ( Figure 6B ) . Thus , pSer13-GFAP marks cytoplasmic GFAP aggregates adjacent to nuclear invaginations . It should be noted that the perinuclear aggregates containing disorganized GFAP filaments are not identical to the electron-dense RFs that are seen in post-mortem patient brain , but that they may reflect an intermediate state of GFAP accumulation . To understand the mechanism for how GFAP phosphorylation may promote GFAP aggregation , we conducted a biochemical analysis of the S13A , S13D and S13E GFAP mutants . In line with our immunofluorescence result ( Figure 3A ) , we observed an increase in high-molecular-mass ~100 kDa GFAP oligomer in the phospho-mimic mutant by immunoblot analysis ( Figure 7A ) . However , more strikingly , we observed increased levels of a cleaved GFAP fragment ( 24 kDa ) in S13D and S13E , which was significantly lower in WT- and S13A-GFAP ( Figure 7A–B ) . Cleavage of GFAP by caspase-6 in vitro generates two fragments of 24 and 26 kDa size ( Chen et al . , 2013 ) . The 24 kDa C-terminal fragment is recognized by the monoclonal GA5 antibody , ( Chen et al . , 2013 ) which was used here . Therefore , we tested the effect of a peptide inhibitor of caspase-6 ( Ac-VEID-CHO ) , and found that it significantly reduced the amount of cleaved S13D-GFAP ( Figure 7C–D ) . Furthermore , we observed augmented cleavage of S13D-GFAP when combined with an AxD-causing mutation ( S13D/R79H double mutant ) , and this was also blocked by the caspase-6 inhibitor ( Figure 7C–D ) . Further analysis of the AxD mutant R79H in the transfection system revealed phosphorylation not only at S13 , but also at nearby Y14 , S16 , and S17 ( Figure 7—figure supplement 1 and Figure 7—source data 1 ) . Of note , mutagenesis of S16 and S17 to non-phosphorylatable alanines reduced both the cleavage and oligomerization of R79H ( Figure 7—figure supplement 1 ) . Phospho-motif analysis revealed that S13 , S16 and S17 are part of a segment in the GFAP head domain that is a potential target for several kinases ( Supplementary file 4 ) . Candidate kinases include casein kinase 2 ( CK2 ) , protein kinase A ( PKA ) , PKC , MAP kinase activated protein kinase 2 ( MAPKAP2 ) , and glycogen synthase kinase 3 ( GSK3 ) . These data suggest that phosphorylation of Ser13 ( and nearby S16/17 ) may promote caspase-6-mediated cleavage of GFAP in the context of AxD mutations . In line with that , we observed increased levels of cleaved GFAP ( upon normalization for total GFAP ) in the AxD iPSC-astrocytes compared to isogenic control astrocytes ( Figure 7E ) , along with intense caspase-6 staining within perinuclear GFAP aggregates in AxD iPSC-astrocytes , but not isogenic control astrocytes ( Figure 7F ) . To determine how blocking GFAP cleavage affects aggregation , we performed site-directed mutagenesis to block cleavage of GFAP at Asp225 . As shown in Figure 8A–B , the D225E mutation reduced cleavage of S13D GFAP by >90% . This resulted in partial rescue of filament structure in S13D , although the D225E mutation on its own caused significant filament bundling and perinuclear structures that resembled large aggregates ( Figure 8C–D ) . We also tested the effect of the caspase-6 inhibitor Ac-VEID-CHO , and found that it reduced both the size of the S13D aggregates ( Figure 8E ) and the presence of ~100 kDa hmm GFAP oligomers ( Figure 8F–G ) . However , similar to the mutagenesis experiment , filament bundles were observed in WT and S13D GFAP treated with Ac-VEID-CHO , suggesting that caspase-6 regulates both aggregation and normal GFAP filament re-organization . Caspase-6 is not expressed highly in the normal human brain , especially after birth ( Godefroy et al . , 2013 ) . Therefore , we wanted to examine its expression in the context of AxD . Using immunoblot analysis of total brain lysates , we found that caspase-6 is expressed in the brain tissue from all 8 AxD patients who died very young , but is essentially undetectable in the patients who survived longer ( Figure 9A ) . To ensure caspase-6 expression is not simply more abundant in young individuals , we compared brain lysates from young and old AxD patients to non-AxD control brains from age-matched individuals , and observed a significant increase in caspase-6 expression selectively in young AxD patients , but not in the other groups ( Figure 9B–C ) . Next we asked whether AxD patients , particularly young AxD patients that exhibit more pSer13-GFAP and caspase-6 expression , also displayed increased GFAP cleavage . To determine the extent of caspase-6-cleaved GFAP in AxD patient brains , we utilized an antibody that specifically recognizes N-terminally caspase-6-cleaved GFAP ( D225 ) ( Chen et al . , 2013 ) . We detected cleaved GFAP in extracts from AxD patient brains , and we observed a significant increase in the amount of D225 signal in young AxD patients , which paralleled the increased pSer13 signal in these samples ( Figure 9D–E ) . In agreement with the biochemical evidence , brain tissues from young AxD patients stained intensely for cleaved GFAP , while the signal was significantly weaker in AxD patients who were older ( Figure 9F; Figure 9—figure supplement 1 ) . The signal was particularly strong around perinuclear areas and surrounded circular structures that stained positive for DAPI ( Figure 9F , bottom panels ) , similar to what we observed in the AxD iPSC-astrocytes . Thus , our results show that caspase-6 expression in AxD patient brain tissue parallels the presence of cleaved GFAP , and both are selectively and significantly elevated in patients who succumbed to the disease very early in life . 3 Discussion Our study reveals that missense mutations , affecting discrete domains on the GFAP molecule , share a common PTM signature that is associated with compromised GFAP proteostasis in the severe form of AxD . Using patient brain tissue and human iPSC-derived AxD astrocytes , we show that head domain phosphorylation promotes defective filament assembly and perinuclear accumulation and incorporation of mutant GFAP within nuclear invaginations . By taking an unbiased mass spectrometry proteomic approach , we were able to identify GFAP phospho-peptides that were selectively elevated in human AxD brain tissue , and subsequently validated these results using a phospho-specific antibody against the most abundant epitope ( pSer13-GFAP ) . We demonstrate the importance of the Ser13 site for GFAP assembly in vitro and in cells . Phospho-mimetic mutation S13D completely abolished the ability of GFAP to form filaments in vitro , without leading to aggregation . In transfected SW13vim- cells , phospho mimic S13D-and S13E-GFAP mutants formed highly abnormal perinuclear aggregates that correlated with increased cleavage of GFAP by caspase-6 . We detected a dramatic increase in caspase-6 expression , in association with Ser13 phosphorylation and cleavage of GFAP , in the brain tissue of AxD patients who succumbed to the disease very early in life . While the N-terminal caspase-6 fragment of GFAP promotes filament aggregation in vitro ( Chen et al . , 2013 ) , presently we do not have direct evidence of cause and effect between caspase-6 cleavage and GFAP aggregation in AxD patient cells . Nevertheless , our current findings provide a basis for exploring PTM-based diagnostic and potential therapeutic strategies in AxD . Our study does not address whether Ser13 phosphorylation directly promotes caspase cleavage of GFAP , or if these two PTMs are independent markers of an increased cellular stress response in AxD . One possibility is that Ser13 phosphorylation destabilizes the filament structure , thereby promoting access of caspase-6 to the rod domain Asp225 residue , where the cleavage occurs . Another likely possibility is that the increased cleavage of GFAP is an indirect result of stress-dependent caspase-6 activation in the more severe form of AxD . This is supported by previous studies showing that AxD mutations promote activation and nuclear accumulation of p53 ( Wang et al . , 2015 ) , which can directly induce caspase-6 expression ( MacLachlan and El-Deiry , 2002 ) . Future studies in AxD iPSC-astrocytes and animal models will be required to determine the timing of GFAP phosphorylation and caspase-6 activation in relationship to GFAP cleavage and aggregation . Given our findings that pSer13-GFAP is enriched in the most aggressive form of AxD , monitoring the levels of this phospho-epitope ( in addition to total GFAP ) in AxD patient cerebrospinal fluid or blood may provide added sensitivity for disease activity ( Jany et al . , 2015 ) . Phosphorylation of Ser13 by protein kinase C and cAMP-dependent protein kinase was initially described in vitro using purified recombinant GFAP ( Inagaki et al . , 1990 ) . In the presence of active kinases , Ser-13 phosphorylation occurred in conjunction with phosphorylation at three additional sites ( Thr-7 , Ser-8 , and Ser-34 ) . Phosphorylation of monomeric GFAP at these sites prevented filament assembly , while phosphorylation of in vitro assembled GFAP filaments led to their disassembly ( Inagaki et al . , 1990 ) . Using the same antibody to pSer13-GFAP that we used in this paper ( clone KT13 ) it was later shown that Aurora-B and Rho-associated kinase phosphorylate GFAP in cultured astrocytoma cells during mitosis ( Inagaki et al . , 1996 ) . This may bear relevance to AxD , since human and mouse AxD astrocytes with RFs display mitotic abnormalities ( Sosunov et al . , 2017 ) . However , it was also shown using knock-in mice with the human GFAP head domain that , in vivo , the distribution of pSer13 localization was not limited to mitotic astrocytes , but that select astrocyte populations within multiple regions were pSer13 positive , such as those in the olfactory bulb , subpial regions , and subventricular zone ( Takemura et al . , 2002b; Hagemann et al . , 2005 ) . Interestingly , the regional distribution of pSer13 largely overlaps with areas that are known to be most enriched in RFs in the AxD mouse model ( Hagemann et al . , 2005 ) . Therefore , this particular phosphorylation event on GFAP may occur during mitosis , or in phenotypically distinct astrocyte populations . This remains to be addressed in the future using the appropriate model systems , as over-expression studies in cancer cell lines ( such as the SW13vim- cells we used here ) may not be truly reflective of the signaling that occurs in astrocytes . In particular , it remains to be resolved whether phosphorylation of GFAP on Ser13 is part of a sequentially priming phosphorylation cascade involving nearby Ser16/17 ( as predicted by the kinase motif analysis ) or if Ser16/17 phosphorylation is unique to the SW13 over-expression system . Importantly , identifying the relevant in vivo kinase ( s ) that phosphorylate GFAP in human AxD may lead to potential novel interventions via kinase inhibition . Caspase-mediated proteolysis of IF proteins is an important mechanism by which the filament networks re-organize during apoptosis . Although multiple effector caspases are capable of cleaving IF proteins , caspase-6 is frequently implicated in cleavage at a conserved motif within the linker L12 region of the rod domain , which results in the generation of two fragments of similar sizes . This was initially demonstrated to be the case for the type I keratins ( Caulín et al . , 1997 ) , and later shown to also occur on vimentin ( Byun et al . , 2001 ) , desmin ( Chen et al . , 2003 ) , A-type lamins ( Ruchaud et al . , 2002 ) , and GFAP ( Hol and Pekny , 2015 ) . Caspase-6 cleavage of GFAP at 222VELD225 in vitro generates an N-terminal 26 kDa fragment and a C-terminal 24 kDa fragment . The N-terminal fragment directly impairs assembly of full-length GFAP and promotes aggregation in vitro ( Chen et al . , 2013 ) . Using a specific antibody recognizing the N-terminal GFAP fragment ( D225 ) , we show here that GFAP cleavage is significantly increased in AxD tissues from patients presenting with an aggressive form of AxD , and that this parallels elevated expression of caspase-6 . This could suggest that misregulation of caspase-6 may contribute to the severity of AxD . However , we were not able to demonstrate in cells that inhibition of caspase-6 , or mutagenesis of the cleavage site on GFAP , can resolve aggregate formation . These results point to a more complex function for caspase-6 , likely involving cytoskeletal remodeling in response to stress . Indeed , caspase-6 upregulation has been reported in other neurodegenerative diseases involving protein aggregation , including Huntington’s Disease ( HD ) and Alzheimer’s Disease ( AD ) ( Albrecht et al . , 2007; Graham et al . , 2010; Guo et al . , 2004 ) . Similar to GFAP , there is a caspase-6 cleavage site on the aggregation-prone proteins in both AD ( amyloid precursor protein ) and HD ( huntingtin ) . Furthermore , in caspase-6 cleavage-resistant genetic mouse models of both HD and AD , neuronal dysfunction and degeneration are rescued ( Graham et al . , 2006; Galvan et al . , 2006; Saganich et al . , 2006 ) . Caspase-6 can promote neurodegeneration via induction of neuronal apoptosis or axon pruning ( Geden et al . , 2019 ) . However , the functions of caspase-6 in astrocytes are not clear . In the context of human AxD it still remains to be determined which astrocyte populations express caspase-6 , and whether it promotes apoptosis or performs a non-apoptotic role , such as sculpting the cytoskeletal architecture in reactive astrocytes . Based on our demonstration that caspase-6 localizes within the perinuclear GFAP inclusions in the AxD iPSC-astrocytes , it is intriguing to speculate that , similar to keratin inclusions in epithelial cells ( Dinsdale et al . , 2004 ) , RFs sequester active caspases away from other cellular substrates and may protect reactive astrocytes from apoptosis . Recently , iPSC-derived patient astrocyte models have emerged as an important system for dissecting the cellular mechanisms in AxD . For example , these novel tools have revealed that AxD astrocytes have defects in the secretory pathway , impaired ATP release , and attenuated calcium waves ( Jones et al . , 2018 ) ; that they inhibit oligodendrocyte precursor cell proliferation ( Li et al . , 2018 ) , providing a potential mechanistic explanation for the degeneration of white matter observed in patients; and that they have defects in mechanotransduction signaling pathways ( Wang et al . , 2018 ) . A novel aspect of the AxD astrocyte cell model that we generated in our study is the perinuclear accumulation of pSer13-GFAP that was associated with prominent nuclear abnormalities . As such , these patient-derived cells replicate a key phenotypic characteristic of RF-bearing AxD astrocytes in vivo , since nuclear invaginations have been described in electron microscopy studies of AxD mouse models and AxD patient cortex ( Sosunov et al . , 2017 ) . Another important parallel is that the GFAP inclusions we observe in the AxD patient astrocytes in vitro stain positive for DAPI , and it was shown that DAPI is a reliable and sensitive marker of RFs in human and mouse brain ( Sosunov et al . , 2017 ) . Therefore patient-derived iPSC-astrocytes provide a unique model system to investigate cytoplasmic-nuclear mechanics in AxD . Invaginations of the nucleus , such as those we observe here , have been described in physiological and pathological states ( Malhas et al . , 2011 ) . Control of nuclear shape is critical for regulation of gene expression and response to mechanotransduction signals ( Uhler and Shivashankar , 2017 ) . The effects of impaired nuclear morphology can be very severe , as evidenced by mutations in lamin A that lead to defective nuclear morphology in Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome ( HGPS ) , where patients experience accelerated aging ( Eriksson et al . , 2003 ) . An elegant study combining multiple 3D imaging strategies established a direct link between intermediate filaments , actin and the nuclear envelope within nuclear invaginations , and genetic evidence indicates that filamentous actin may play a role in generating these structures ( Jorgens et al . , 2017; Frost et al . , 2016 ) . It is hypothesized that nuclear invaginations provide localized control of gene expression and nuclear-cytoplasmic transport deep within the nucleus , since they have been found to contain calcium receptors and nuclear pores ( Malhas et al . , 2011 ) . Our study provides the first link between abnormal cytoplasmic PTM processing and perinuclear accumulation of mutant GFAP with nuclear defects , setting the stage to address how nucleo-cytoskeletal coupling is adversely impacted by defective IF proteostasis in AxD and related human diseases . 4 Materials and methods The following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-GFAP ( DAKO Agilent , Santa Clara , CA , Z0334 ) , rabbit anti-caspase-6 ( Cell Signaling Technologies , Danvers , MA , 9762 ) , rabbit anti-Caspase-6 ( abcam , Cambridge , UK , ab185645 ) , rabbit anti-D225 ( Chen et al . , 2013 ) , mouse anti-GFAP ( Sigma , GA5 ) , mouse anti-pSer13-GFAP ( KT13 [Sekimata et al . , 1996] ) , mouse anti-pan Actin , mouse anti-Tra-1–60 , mouse anti-SSEA4 , rabbit anti-Oct4 , rabbit anti-Sox2 , and Alexa 488- and Alexa 594-congujated goat anti mouse or rabbit antibodies ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA ) . SW13vim- cells were provided by Dr Bishr Omary and cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin . Authentication of the cell line was done by short tandem repeat ( STR ) profiling by ATCC . Fibroblasts from a male 6 year old type I AxD patient were obtained from the Coriell institute ( Camden , NJ ) . Sanger sequencing was performed to confirm the AxD mutation was present in the cells ( c . 715C > T; p . Arg239Cys ) . The cell lines used tested negative for mycoplasma contamination , as assayed using the Universal Mycoplasma Detection Kit ( ATCC 30–1012K ) . De-identified post-mortem fresh-frozen and fixed AxD patient and control brain tissues were provided by the NIH NeuroBioBank and are described in Supplementary files 1 and 2 . Sample Preparation: HSEs from AxD patient post-mortem brain cortex tissue were prepared as described previously ( Battaglia et al . , 2017; Snider and Omary , 2016 ) and in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 , then subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie stain . Bands corresponding to GFAP were excised and the proteins were reduced , alkylated , and in-gel digested with trypsin overnight at 37 °C . Peptides were extracted , desalted with C18 spin columns ( Pierce – Thermo Fisher Scientific ) and dried via vacuum centrifugation . Peptide samples were stored at −80°C until further analysis . LC-MS/MS Analysis: The peptide samples were analyzed by LC/MS/MS using an Easy nLC 1200 coupled to a QExactive HF mass spectrometer ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . Samples were injected onto an Easy Spray PepMap C18 column ( 75 μm id ×25 cm , 2 μm particle size ) ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) and separated over a 1 hr method . The gradient for separation consisted of 5–40% mobile phase B at a 250 nl/min flow rate , where mobile phase A was 0 . 1% formic acid in water and mobile phase B consisted of 0 . 1% formic acid in 80% ACN . The QExactive HF was operated in data-dependent mode where the 15 most intense precursors were selected for subsequent fragmentation . Resolution for the precursor scan ( m/z 300–1600 ) was set to 120 , 000 with a target value of 3 × 106 ions . MS/MS scans resolution was set to 15 , 000 with a target value of 1 × 105 ions . The normalized collision energy was set to 27% for HCD . Dynamic exclusion was set to 30 s , peptide match was set to preferred , and precursors with unknown charge or a charge state of 1 and ≥7 were excluded . Data Analysis: Raw data files were processed using Proteome Discoverer version 2 . 1 ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . Peak lists were searched against a reviewed Uniprot human database , appended with a common contaminants database , using Sequest . The following parameters were used to identify tryptic peptides for protein identification: 10 ppm precursor ion mass tolerance; 0 . 02 Da product ion mass tolerance; up to two missed trypsin cleavage sites; phosphorylation of Ser , Thr and Tyr were set as variable modifications . The ptmRS node was used to localize the sites of phosphorylation . Peptide false discovery rates ( FDR ) were calculated by the Percolator node using a decoy database search and data were filtered using a 5% FDR cutoff . The peak areas for the identified peptides were extracted and used for relative quantitation across samples . Mutagenesis of GFAP ( Origene , Rockville , MD , in vector CMV6-XL6 ) was performed using the QuikChange II mutagenesis kit ( Agilent ) to generate the designated point mutants . Sanger sequencing of the entire coding sequence of GFAP was performed to confirm the wild-type and mutant sequences . We used established procedures for the purification and in vitro assembly of GFAP ( Perng et al . , 2016 ) . For transfections , lipofectamine 2000 was used according to the supplier instructions ( Invitrogen , Thermo Fisher Scientific , Carlsbad , CA ) , and experiments were performed 20–24 hr after transfection . For immunofluorescence , cells were fixed in methanol at −20°C for 10 min , washed three times in PBS and incubated in blocking solution ( 2 . 5% bovine serum albumin , 2% normal goat serum in PBS ) for 1 hr at room temperature . Primary antibodies were diluted into blocking buffer and incubated overnight at 4°C . The next day , cells were washed 3 times in PBS and incubated with Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted into blocking buffer for 1 hr at room temperature . Cells were washed 3 times in PBS , incubated in DAPI for 5 min , washed 3 times and mounted in Fluoromount-G ( SouthernBiotech , Birmingham , AL ) overnight . Cells were imaged on Zeiss 880 confocal laser scanning microscope using a 63x ( 1 . 4 NA ) oil immersion objective ( Zeiss , Jena , Germany ) . High salt extracts ( HSEs ) and triton-X ( TX ) lysates were prepared as previously described ( Battaglia et al . , 2017 ) . Total lysates were prepared by homogenizing 25 mg tissue directly into hot 2X Tris-Glycine SDS Sample Buffer ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) and heating for 5 min at 95°C . Immunoblotting was performed as previously described ( Trogden et al . , 2018 ) . Briefly , samples were resolved on 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE gels transferred onto activated polyvinylidene difluoride membranes at 40V overnight . The transferred gels were routinely stained with Coomassie blue and the membranes were blocked in 5% non-fat milk in 0 . 1% tween 20/PBS ( PBST ) . Post-transfer Coomassie-stained gels served as another loading control where the levels of housekeeping protein ( actin ) varied ( Figure 4E ) . For immunoblotting , the membranes were incubated with the appropriate primary antibody diluted in 5% milk/PBST , with the exception of KT13 , which was incubated in 5% bovine serum albumin/PBST for blocking , primary antibodies and secondary antibodies . Antibodies were detected using ECL reagents ( PerkinElmer Life Sciences , Hopkinton , MA ) . For 2D gel analysis , HSEs were dissolved in 2-D starter kit rehydration/sample buffer ( Biorad; 1632106 ) for separation by isoelectric focusing ( IEF ) . Immobilized pH gradient ( IPG ) strips ( Biorad; 11 cm; pH 4–7; 1632015 ) were passively rehydrated in 2-D starter kit rehydration/sample buffer overnight . Cup loading method was employed to load the protein samples in cathode side ( as isoelectric point of GFAP is 5 . 2 ) of the Protean IEF cell tray ( Biorad; 1654020 ) . The IEF separation was done using 72000 vh . After IEF separation the protein samples were further separated based on molecular weight using SDS-PAGE gel by applying constant 90 volts . Skin fibroblasts were reprogrammed under feeder free conditions using Cytotune –iPS 2 . 0 Sendai Reprogramming kit and individual iPSC clones were picked for propagation in culture for 10 passages . To confirm stemness and differentiation capabilities of reprogrammed and edited iPSCs , we used the qPCR based TaqMan human Pluripotent Stem Cell Scorecard Panel ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . iPSCs were differentiated into all three germ layers using STEMdiff Trilineage Differentiation Kit ( StemCell Technologies , Vancouver , Canada ) , and a monolayer-based protocol was used to directly differentiate hES cells in parallel into the three germ layers ( ~1 week ) . Non-differentiated and differentiated cells were lysed and total RNA purified using the RNeasy kit ( QIAGEN ) . RNA reverse transcription was performed following the Taqman Scorecard’s manufacture guidelines and the qRT-PCR was carried out using the QuantStudio 7 Flex Real-Time PCR system . The TaqMan PCR assay combines DNA methylation mapping , gene expression profiling , and transcript counting of lineage marker genes ( Bock et al . , 2011 ) . Reprogrammed and edited iPSCs were submitted to a standard G-band analysis consisting of 20 metaphase spreads . The analysis ( carried out by Karyologic Inc ) can identify gender , chromosome number , and detect aberrations that include trisomies , monosomies , deletions , insertions , translocations , duplications , breaks , polyploidy , among others . No abnormalities were found in our cell lines ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2A ) . We used the TrueCut Cas9 Protein V2 , sgRNAs and the Neon Transfection system ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) to edit iPSCs . The recombinant TrueCut Cas9 V2 was diluted in resuspension buffer R provided in the kit and mixed with 900 ng of sgRNA and 2700 ng of single-stranded donor oligonucleotide , incubated 15 min at room temperature and then a total of 3 × 105 iPSCs were electroporated with the ribonucleoprotein mix . Seventy-two hours after electroporation , cells were dissociated into single cells , diluted , and seeded on Matrigel-coated 96-well plates . Single-cell colonies were selected after two weeks and tested for gene correction . Genomic DNA of single clones was extracted and the gene of interest amplified by PCR using allele specific primers . Sanger sequencing of positive clones demonstrated single or double allele gene correction . Off-target sites within the exons of genes were predicted via selection of the top candidates using the MIT software ( CRISPR . mit . edu ) . The analysis was performed via PCR of 400 bp fragments , which flanked the predicted off-target cut site followed by Sanger sequencing . The chromatograms for edited clones were compared to sequences from the original AxD patient cells . iPSCs were maintained on Matrigel in StemFlex medium ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) and passaged every 3–4 days with 0 . 5 mM EDTA dissociation solution . iPSCs were differentiated into neural progenitor cells ( NPC ) using an embryoid body ( EB ) protocol . Briefly , iPSCs at 80% confluence were collected , resuspended in Neural Induction Medium ( NIM , StemCell Technologies ) and seeded on one well of an Aggrewell 800 plate ( StemCell Technologies ) at 3 × 106 cells per well . At day five , EBs were seeded on poly-ornithine and laminin ( PLO/LAM ) -coated dishes in NIM . Rosette selection was performed after 12 days using Rosette Selection Reagent ( StemCell Technologies ) . NPCs were expanded for 7 days in Neural Progenitor Medium ( StemCell Technologies ) . NPCs were then differentiated into astrocyte precursors by seeding dissociated single cells at 1 × 105 cells/cm2 density on PLO/LAM dishes in STEMdiff astrocyte differentiation medium ( StemCell Technologies ) . Astrocyte precursors were maintained for 20 days with medium changes every 48 hr and splitting every week with Accutase ( Millipore , Burlington , MA ) . Astrocytes were expanded for up to 120 days in STEMdiff astrocyte maturation medium ( StemCell Technologies ) . AxD iPSC-astrocytes grown on a polystyrene dish were fixed in 2 . 5% glutaraldehyde in 0 . 1M sodium cacodylate buffer , pH 7 . 4 , for one hour at room temperature and stored at 4°C . The cells were washed 3 times in 0 . 1M sodium cacodylate buffer followed by post-fixation in 1% buffered osmium tetroxide for 1 hr . After three washes in deionized water , the cells were dehydrated in ethanol , infiltrated and embedded in situ in PolyBed 812 epoxy resin ( Polysciences , Inc , Warrington , PA ) . The cell monolayer was sectioned en face to the substrate with a diamond knife and Leica UCT Ultramicrotome ( Leica Microsystems , Inc , Buffalo Grove , IL ) . Ultrathin sections ( 70 nm ) were mounted on 200 mesh copper grids and stained with 4% uranyl acetate and lead citrate . The sections were observed and digital images were taken using a JEOL JEM-1230 transmission electron microscope operating at 80kV ( JEOL USA , Inc , Peabody , MA ) equipped with a Gatan Orius SC1000 CCD Digital Camera ( Gatan , Inc , Pleasanton , CA ) ."}

While antimalarial drugs and insecticides have successfully reduced deaths over the last 20 years , the parasite that causes malaria is starting to gain resistance to these treatments . Vaccines offer an alternative route to preventing the disease . However , the most advanced vaccine currently available provides less than 50% protection . Vaccines work by encouraging the body to develop proteins called antibodies , which can recognize the parasite and trigger an immune response that blocks the infection . These antibodies target a molecule on the parasite’s surface called circumsporozoite protein , or CSP for short . Therefore , having a better understanding of how antibodies interact with CSP could help researchers design more effective treatments . A lot of what is known about malaria has come from studying this disease in mice . However , it remained unclear whether antibodies produced in rodents combat the malaria-causing parasite in a similar manner to human antibodies . To answer this question , Kucharska , Thai et al . studied a mouse antibody called 3D11 , which targets CSP on the surface of a parasite that causes malaria in rodents . The interaction between CSP and 3D11 was studied using three different techniques in order to better understand how the structure of CSP changes when bound by antibodies . The experiments showed that although CSP has a highly flexible structure , it forms a more stable , spiral-like architecture when bound to multiple copies of 3D11 . A similar type of assembly was previously observed in studies investigating how CSP interacts with human antibodies . Further investigation revealed that the molecular connections between 3D11 and CSP share a lot of similarities with how human antibodies recognize CSP . These findings reveal how mammals evolved similar mechanisms for detecting and inhibiting malaria-causing parasites . This highlights the robust features antibodies need to launch an immune response against malaria , which could help develop a more effective vaccine .", "article": "1 Introduction Despite extensive biomedical and public health measures , malaria persists as a major global health concern , with an estimated 405 , 000 deaths and 228 million cases annually ( WHO , 2019 ) . Moreover , resistant strains have been detected against all currently available antimalarial drugs , including sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine , mefloquine , halofantrine , quinine , and artemisinin ( Cui et al . , 2015; Ross and Fidock , 2019 ) . Although ~94% of deaths are caused by Plasmodium falciparum ( Pf ) ( WHO , 2019 ) , other Plasmodium species that infect humans ( P . vivax , P . malariae , P . knowlesi and P . ovale ) also cause debilitating disease and have been associated with fatal outcomes ( Lover et al . , 2018 ) . All Plasmodium species have a complex life cycle divided between a vertebrate host and an Anopheles mosquito vector ( Hall and Fauci , 2009 ) . During a blood meal , sporozoites are deposited into the skin of a host organism from the salivary glands of a mosquito , and subsequently migrate through the bloodstream to infect host hepatocytes ( de Koning-Ward et al . , 2015 ) . Due to the small number of parasites transmitted and the expression of protein antigens that possess conserved functional regions ( Rosenberg et al . , 1990; Smith et al . , 2014 ) , the pre-erythrocytic sporozoite stage of the Plasmodium life cycle has long been considered a promising target for the development of an anti-malarial vaccine ( Nussenzweig and Nussenzweig , 1984 ) . Circumsporozoite protein ( CSP ) is the most abundant protein on the surface of Plasmodium sporozoites , and is necessary for parasite development in mosquitoes and establishment of infection in host liver cells ( Cerami et al . , 1992; Frevert et al . , 1993; Ménard et al . , 1997 ) . Flanked by N- and C-terminal domains , CSP contains an unusual central region consisting of multiple , short ( 4 to 8 ) amino acid ( aa ) repeats ( Eichinger et al . , 1986; Dame et al . , 1984; Plassmeyer et al . , 2009; Zavala et al . , 1983 ) . The sequence of the repeating motif depends on the Plasmodium species and field isolate ( Chenet et al . , 2012; Rich et al . , 2000; Tahar et al . , 1998 ) . Importantly , the central region of CSP is highly immunodominant and antibodies targeting the repeats can inhibit sporozoite infectivity by preventing parasite migration ( Mishra et al . , 2012 ) and attachment to hepatocytes ( Potocnjak et al . , 1980; Yoshida et al . , 1980 ) . PfCSP is a major component of the leading malaria vaccine RTS , S/AS01 , which is currently undergoing pilot implementation in Africa ( Adepoju , 2019; Draper et al . , 2018 ) . Anti-PfCSP repeat antibodies have been suggested to form the predominant humoral immune response elicited by RTS , S/AS01 , and correlate with vaccine efficacy ( Dobaño et al . , 2019; McCall et al . , 2018; Olotu et al . , 2016 ) . However , RTS , S/AS01 offers only modest and short-lived protection ( RTS , S Clinical Trials Partnership , 2015; RTS , S Clinical Trials Partnership et al . , 2012; RTS , S Clinical Trials Partnership et al . , 2011 ) ; thus , it is critical to develop a better molecular understanding of the antibody response against this Plasmodium antigen , particularly the repeat region ( Davies et al . , 2015; Doolan , 2011; Illingworth et al . , 2019 ) , to obtain valuable information needed for improved vaccine design . Our understanding of Plasmodium biology and key host-parasite interactions has been enhanced by studies using rodent parasites , including P . berghei ( Pb ) , P . chabaudi and P . yoelii ( De Niz and Heussler , 2018 ) . In vivo studies evaluating the inhibitory potential of mAbs are often derived from these rodent parasite models , or transgenic rodent sporozoites harboring PfCSP , as Pf fails to infect rodents . For example , mAb 3D11 was isolated from mice exposed to the bites of mosquitoes that had been infected with γ-irradiated Pb parasites ( Yoshida et al . , 1980 ) . mAb 3D11 recognition of the PbCSP central repeat region on the surface of live sporozoites resulted in abolished Pb infectivity in vitro and in vivo ( Cochrane et al . , 1976 ) . Electron micrographs of Pb sporozoites pre-treated with mAb 3D11 revealed the presence of amorphous , precipitated material on the parasite surface characteristic of the circumsporozoite precipitation reaction ( Yoshida et al . , 1980 ) . This antibody continues to be widely used in model systems of sporozoite infection . For example , a recent study used mAb 3D11 in combination with transmission-blocking mAb 4B7 to show that antibody targeting of both the pre-erythrocytic and sexual stages of a Pfs25-transgenic Pb parasite led to a synergistic reduction of parasite transmission in mice ( Sherrard-Smith et al . , 2018 ) . However , it remains unclear whether murine mAb 3D11 recognizes the central domain of PbCSP with the same molecular principles as the most potent human anti-PfCSP repeat antibodies , for which molecular details have recently emerged ( Imkeller et al . , 2018; Julien and Wardemann , 2019; Kisalu et al . , 2018; Murugan et al . , 2020; Oyen et al . , 2018; Oyen et al . , 2017; Tan et al . , 2018; Triller et al . , 2017 ) . Here , we characterized the structure of the PbCSP repeats unliganded and as recognized by mAb 3D11 . Our molecular studies reveal that mAb 3D11 binds across all PbCSP repeat motifs and induces structural ordering of PbCSP in a spiral-like conformation using homotypic interactions . 2 Results The central repeats of PfCSP and PbCSP consist of recurring 4-aa motifs rich in asparagine and proline residues ( Figure 1A ) . PfCSP is composed of repeating NANP motifs interspersed with intermittent NVDP repeats , and a singular NPDP motif in the junction immediately following the N-terminal domain . While the major repeat motif of PfCSP is often referred to as NANP , numerous reports have identified NPNA as the structurally relevant unit of the central region ( Kisalu et al . , 2018; Oyen et al . , 2017; Dyson et al . , 1990; Ghasparian et al . , 2006 ) . Similarly , the central domain of PbCSP contains an array of PPPP and PAPP motifs interspersed with NPND or NAND motifs ( Figure 1A ) . Notably , both orthologs contain the conserved pentamer , KLKQP , known as Region I , at the C-terminal end of the N-terminal domain . To examine and compare the structural properties of the various Pf and Pb repeat motifs in solution , we performed molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations using eight different peptides ranging in length from 15 to 20 aa , with four peptides derived from Pf [KQPADGNPDPNANPN ( ‘KQPA’ ) ; NPDPNANPNVDPNANP ( ‘NPDP’ ) ; ( NVDPNANP ) 2NVDP ( ‘NVDP’ ) ; and ( NPNA ) 5 ( ‘NPNA’ ) ] , and four peptides from Pb [ ( PPPPNPND ) 2 ( ‘NPND’ ) ; ( PPPPNAND ) 2 ( ‘NAND’ ) ; ( PAPPNAND ) 2 ( ‘PAPP’ ) ; and PPPPNPNDPAPPNANAD ( ‘Mixed’ ) ; Figure 1B–G] . Each simulation was conducted in water for a total production time of 18 μs . All eight peptides were highly disordered and adopted a large ensemble of conformations with low to moderate secondary structure propensities ( Figure 1B and E ) , which are best described in statistical terms . The only secondary structure observed was local , and consisted of sparse , transient hydrogen-bonded turns ( Figure 1C and F , Figure 1—figure supplement 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 2 , and Supplementary file 1 ) . In particular , these interactions consisted of forward α- , β- , and γ-turns , with the β-turns being the most populated ( up to 40%; Figure 1C and F ) , consistent with previous NMR studies focused on the NANP repeats ( Dyson et al . , 1990 ) . Across all peptides , the average β-turn lifetime ranged from 2 . 7 ± 0 . 2 ns for the Pb PPNA turn to 4 . 4 ± 0 . 4 ns for DPNA turns found within PfCSP ( Supplementary file 1 ) . In line with reports identifying NPNA as the main structural repeating unit of PfCSP ( Kisalu et al . , 2018; Oyen et al . , 2017; Dyson et al . , 1990; Ghasparian et al . , 2006 ) , turns were predominantly observed within these motifs , as well as DPNA , NPNV , and ADGN sequences amongst the PfCSP peptides . NPND and PPNA exhibited the greatest propensity to form β-turns of the PbCSP repeats . Importantly , each individual motif consistently exhibited the same structural tendencies , independent of their position and the overall peptide sequence in which they were contained ( Figure 1C and F , and Supplementary file 1 ) . Furthermore , using the probability rule stating that two events are independent if the equation P ( A∩B ) =P ( A ) ·P ( B ) holds true , we show that the presence of an intramolecular hydrogen bond in one motif does not alter the hydrogen-bonding propensities of adjacent motifs ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2B and C ) . Therefore , in both PfCSP and PbCSP we conclude that there is no discernable cooperativity between the structures of different repeat motifs , and as such , in the absence of extended or nonlocal secondary structure , each of these motifs behaves as an independent unit with its own intrinsic secondary structure propensities . To examine the influence of Asn , Asp , and Gln sidechains on the conformational ensemble of the peptides , we computed contact maps for backbone-sidechain hydrogen bonds ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 and Supplementary file 1 ) . We found that the majority of contacts are in the form of pseudo α-turns and β-turns , with backbone NH groups donating to sidechain O atoms . Notably , we discovered that these transient sidechain contacts do not have a stabilizing effect on backbone-backbone hydrogen bonds and consequently , are not correlated with the presence of these bonds ( numerical example in Figure 1—figure supplement 2B and C ) . In summary , the four Pf and four Pb peptides corresponding to CSP central repeats were all found to be highly disordered , resulting in an ensemble of conformations . The only secondary structure elements present were sparse and local hydrogen-bonded turns within each motif . Each structural motif acted independently from adjacent sequences and behaved similarly in various peptides . Next , we investigated the binding of mAb 3D11 to the PbCSP repeat of low structural propensity . Our biolayer interferometry ( BLI ) studies indicated that 3D11 Fab binds PbCSP with complex kinetics , but overall high affinity ( Figure 2A ) . Isothermal titration calorimetry ( ITC ) also indicated a high affinity interaction , with a KD value of 159 ± 47 nM ( Figure 2B ) . In addition , ITC revealed a very high binding stoichiometry ( N = 10 ± 1 ) , suggesting that approximately ten copies of 3D11 Fab bound one molecule of PbCSP simultaneously . Size-exclusion chromatography coupled with multi-angle light scattering ( SEC-MALS ) characterization of the 3D11 Fab-PbCSP complex confirmed the high binding stoichiometry with a molecular weight of 587 ± 7 kDa for the complex ( Figure 2C–D ) . This size is consistent with approximately eleven 3D11 Fabs bound to one molecule of PbCSP , and thus , is in agreement with the results from the ITC studies within experimental error . Therefore , through a number of biophysical studies , we show that up to eleven copies of 3D11 Fab can bind simultaneously to PbCSP with high affinity . We next sought to define the exact mAb 3D11 epitope . We first conducted BLI studies to confirm that mAb 3D11 does not bind the PbCSP C-terminal domain ( residues 202–318; Figure 3—figure supplement 1A ) . Next , we performed ITC studies to evaluate 3D11 Fab binding to each of the four peptides derived from the PbCSP central repeat region that were used in our MD simulations ( Figure 3A ) . Our experiments revealed that mAb 3D11 preferentially binds the NPND and Mixed peptides with high affinity ( KD = 45 ± 15 nM and 44 ± 4 nM , respectively ) , but also binds the NAND and PAPP peptides , albeit with lower affinity ( KD = 207 ± 1 nM and 611 ± 139 nM , respectively ) . To gain insight into the molecular basis of this preference , we solved the X-ray crystal structures of 3D11 Fab in complex with each peptide . The structure of the 3D11 Fab-NPND complex was determined at 2 . 30 Å resolution , while the structures of 3D11 Fab in complex with each of the other three peptides were all solved at ~1 . 60 Å resolution ( Table 1 ) . Interestingly , all four peptides adopted almost identical conformations when bound by 3D11 Fab ( Figure 3B and Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) , fitting deep into the binding groove and forming a curved , U-shaped structure ( Figure 3C ) . Amongst all four peptides , the mAb 3D11 core epitope consisted of eight residues [PN ( A/P ) NDP ( A/P ) P] with an all-atom RMSD <0 . 5 Å . Importantly , this shared recognition mode ideally positions aromatic side chains in the mAb 3D11 complementarity determining regions ( CDRs ) to form favorable pi-stacking and hydrophobic cage interactions around each PbCSP peptide ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2 ) . Indeed , the majority of these contacts are made with residues that are conserved between all four PbCSP repeat peptides , and thus , contribute to the cross-reactive binding profile of mAb 3D11 . Despite binding in nearly identical conformations , differences exist in the molecular details of 3D11 Fab binding to each peptide that provide key insights into mAb 3D11 recognition of PbCSP . Our crystal structures revealed that more van der Waals contacts were formed by a Pro residue in the PPPP and NPND motifs compared to an Ala at the same position in the PAPP and NAND motifs ( Figure 3D ) . Consequently , the epitopes of the NAND , NPND and Mixed peptides had a slightly greater buried surface area ( BSA; 753 , 762 , and 765 Å2 , respectively ) than the PAPP peptide ( 743 Å2 ) , which only consists of Ala-containing motifs ( Supplementary file 2 ) . In particular , Pro10 of the PPPP motif found in the NAND and NPND peptides forms more van der Waals interactions with antibody residues H . Asn33 and H . Tyr52 compared to Ala10 of the PAPP motif present in PAPP and Mixed peptides . Similarly , Pro6 of the NPND motif in the NPND and Mixed peptides makes additional interactions with antibody residue K . Leu50 that are not present for Ala6 of the NAND motif within the PAPP and NAND peptides ( Supplementary file 2 ) . These differences in interactions observed at the atomic level directly relate to the binding affinities measured by ITC , where the PbCSP peptides that bury more surface area in the 3D11 paratope have the highest binding affinities ( Figure 3A ) . To understand how mAb 3D11 recognizes full-length PbCSP , we performed cryoEM analysis on the SEC-purified 3D11 Fab-PbCSP complex ( Figure 2D ) . A dataset of 165 , 747 3D11 Fab-PbCSP particle images was refined with no symmetry imposed , resulting in a 3 . 2 Å resolution reconstruction of 3D11 Fabs peripherally arranged around PbCSP with their variable domains clustered around a central density ( Figure 4 , Table 2 , and Figure 4—figure supplement 1 and Figure 4—figure supplement 2 ) . Although the low-pass filtered ( 20 Å ) cryoEM map of the 3D11 Fab-PbCSP complex contains visible density for >10 3D11 Fabs ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2F ) , only the density for the seven central Fabs was strong enough to warrant building a molecular model . Indeed , 3D Variability Analysis ( Punjani and Fleet , 2020 ) in cryoSPARC v2 ( Punjani et al . , 2017 ) revealed continuous flexibility at the N- and C-termini of the 3D11 Fab-PbCSP complex ( Figure 4—video 1 ) . The PbCSP repeat forms the core of the complex and is arranged into a triangular spiral of 51 Å pitch and 16 Å diameter ( Figure 4B–C ) , which fits 61 of the 108 residues in the PbCSP central region . We assigned the density to the high-affinity PPPPNPND repeats . The angle between two Fab variable domains is ~126o , such that approximately three Fabs are required to complete one full turn of the spiral ( Figure 4A ) . The cryoEM structure of the 3D11 Fab-PbCSP complex and the crystal structures of the 3D11 Fab-peptide complexes are in remarkable agreement for both the Fab ( backbone RMSD = 0 . 69 Å ) and the PbCSP repeat region ( backbone RMSD = 0 . 66 Å; Figure 4—figure supplement 3 ) . Minor differences exist in the N- and C-termini of the peptides , presumably because the termini are largely unrestricted in the crystal structures compared to the cryoEM structure . To access their repeating and densely-packed epitopes , 3D11 Fabs are closely arranged against one another in the 3D11 Fab-PbCSP complex . Indeed , the epitope for a single Fab can be defined by 14 residues ( PPPPNPNDPPPPNP , Supplementary file 3 ) , with the six C-terminal residues constituting the beginning of the epitope for the adjacent Fab . When considering two adjacent Fabs as a single binding unit , the BSA of the Fabs is 1313 Å2 , and 1636 Å2 for PbCSP . Interestingly , we observe multiple Fab-Fab contacts in the cryoEM structure ( Figure 5 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) . Comparison of the mAb 3D11 sequence to its inferred germline precursor ( IGHV1-12 and IGKV1-135 ) reveals that some of the residues involved in these homotypic contacts have been somatically hypermutated ( H . Tyr50 and H . Val56 in HCDR2 , H . Asn58 and H . Thr73 in heavy chain ( HC ) framework region ( FR ) 3 , and K . Tyr27D in KCDR1; Figure 5C ) . While H . Tyr50 , H . Val56 and K . Tyr27D mediate Fab-Fab contacts in addition to directly interacting with PbCSP , H . Asn58 and H . Thr73 are only involved in Fab-Fab interactions . To investigate the role of affinity maturation in enhancing Fab-Fab contacts , somatically mutated HC residues H . Asn58 and H . Thr73 were reverted to their inferred germline precursors ( N58S and T73K: subsequently named H-58/73; Figure 5C ) . We performed ITC studies to evaluate binding of wild-type ( WT ) and H-58/73 germline-reverted mutant 3D11 Fabs to two peptides derived from PbCSP , designed based on our X-ray and cryoEM structures to constitute the minimal binding site for one 3D11 Fab ( PPPPNPNDPPPP , denoted ‘NPNDx1’ ) or two 3D11 Fabs in a ‘head-to-head’ conformation ( PPPPNPNDPPPPNPNDPPPPNPND , denoted ‘NPNDx2’ ) . Although both WT and H-58/73 germline-reverted mutant Fabs bound NPNDx1 with comparable affinity , WT 3D11 Fab demonstrated significantly greater affinity for NPNDx2 compared to NPNDx1 ( KD values of 45 ± 6 nM and 127 ± 32 nM , respectively; Figure 5D ) . On the other hand , the H-58/73 germline-reverted mutant bound each peptide with similar affinities ( KD values of 140 ± 38 nM for NPNDx2 and 160 ± 56 nM for NPNDx1; Figure 5D ) . The improved binding affinity of WT 3D11 Fab for NPNDx2 compared to NPNDx1 , which is not observed for the H-58/73 germline-reverted mutant 3D11 Fab , suggests an important role for residues H . Asn58 and H . Thr73 in mediating homotypic interactions between neighboring 3D11 Fabs bound to PbCSP . Together , these data provide evidence for the affinity maturation of homotypic contacts that indirectly strengthen mAb 3D11 affinity to PbCSP . To examine whether 3D11 IgG can induce a similar type of spiral conformation of PbCSP as 3D11 Fab , we prepared complexes of 3D11 IgG-PbCSP for negative-stain ( ns ) EM analysis . Incubation of PbCSP with excess 3D11 IgG resulted in significant precipitation of the sample , presumably due to IgG-induced crosslinking of PbCSP molecules ( Figure 5—figure supplement 2A–B ) . Nonetheless , a minor soluble fraction of the complex could be purified . Comparison of nsEM 2D class averages of this 3D11 IgG-PbCSP fraction to 2D class averages of the 3D11 Fab-PbCSP complex indicated that binding of either the 3D11 Fab or IgG can induce structural ordering of PbCSP into similar spiral conformations ( Figure 5—figure supplement 2C ) . Our findings are in agreement with a similar analysis previously performed with human 311 Fab and IgG in complex with PfCSP ( Oyen et al . , 2018 ) , which also observed the ability of both IgG and Fab to induce a spiral-like conformation in CSP . 3 Discussion The CSP repeat is of broad interest for malaria vaccine design because it is targeted by inhibitory antibodies capable of preventing sporozoite infection as the parasite transits from Anopheles mosquitoes to mammalian hosts . Biophysical studies of the PfCSP central NANP repeat have shown that this region possesses low secondary structure propensities ( Dyson et al . , 1990 ) , and AFM studies on live Pf sporozoites suggest a range of conformations for PfCSP ( Patra et al . , 2017; Herrera et al . , 2015 ) . Importantly , recent studies have uncovered that some of the most potent antibodies against the PfCSP repeat region are cross-reactive with the PfCSP N-terminal junction , which harbors KQPA , NPDP and NVDP motifs interspersed with NANP motifs ( Kisalu et al . , 2018; Murugan et al . , 2020; Tan et al . , 2018 ) . Our MD simulations of different sub-regions of the PfCSP central repeat , including the N-junction , provided detailed descriptions of their conformational ensemble and revealed that each sequence motif possesses a similarly low structural propensity . Our MD simulations for PbCSP also indicated that the low structural propensity of central repeat motifs with subtle sequence variance extends to other Plasmodium species . These findings are in agreement with studies linking repetitive , low-complexity peptide sequences to structural disorder ( Rauscher and Pomès , 2012; Rauscher and Pomès , 2017; Romero et al . , 2001 ) . The role of the numerous repetitive sequences observed in parasitic genomes ( Tan et al . , 2010; Mendes et al . , 2013; Davies et al . , 2017 ) remains to be fully understood , but is postulated to include maximizing parasite interactions with the target host cell ( Mendes et al . , 2013 ) , allowing the parasite to adapt under selective pressure by varying its number of repeats ( Davies et al . , 2017 ) , and impairing the host immune response ( Ly and Hansen , 2019; Portugal et al . , 2015; Sullivan et al . , 2015 ) . Binding of the PfCSP repeat by inhibitory antibodies has been shown to induce various conformations in this intrinsically disordered region ( Imkeller et al . , 2018; Kisalu et al . , 2018; Murugan et al . , 2020; Oyen et al . , 2017; Tan et al . , 2018; Triller et al . , 2017; Scally and Julien , 2018; Pholcharee et al . , 2020 ) . Here , we show that the PbCSP repeat adopts an extended and bent conformation when recognized by inhibitory mAb 3D11 . Antibody recognition of the PfCSP repeat is often mediated by aromatic cages formed by the paratope , which surround prolines , backbone atoms , and aliphatic portions of side chains in the epitope ( Murugan et al . , 2020; Pholcharee et al . , 2020 ) . Antibody paratope residues partaking in aromatic cages often include germline-encoded residues , such as H . Trp52 from VH3-33 signature genes that are strongly recruited in the humoral response against PfCSP ( Julien and Wardemann , 2019; Pholcharee et al . , 2020; Murugan et al . , 2018 ) . Similarly , murine mAb 3D11 uses eight aromatic residues to recognize the PbCSP repeat . Germline-encoded K . Tyr32 appears to play a central role in mAb 3D11 PbCSP recognition by contacting consecutive Asn-Asp-Pro residues ( PN ( A/P ) NDP ( A/P ) P ) in the middle of the core epitope , contributing 58 Å2 of BSA on the Fab . These findings indicate a central role for germline-encoded aromatic residues in antibody binding of Plasmodium CSP repeats across species . Our structural and biophysical data demonstrated that mAb 3D11 is cross-reactive and binds the different repeat motifs of PbCSP in nearly identical conformations . Such cross-reactivity for the repeat motifs of subtle differences in PfCSP is also exhibited by inhibitory human antibodies encoded by a variety of Ig-gene combinations ( Kisalu et al . , 2018; Murugan et al . , 2020; Tan et al . , 2018; Triller et al . , 2017; Scally et al . , 2018 ) . Notably , the inferred germline precursor genes of mAb 3D11 ( IGHV1-12/IGKV1-135 ) share the most sequence similarity with the human IGHV1-3/IGKV2-30 genes ( 68% and 82% sequence identity , respectively ) ; IGHV1-3 is the inferred germline precursor of the potent , cross-reactive human mAb CIS43 ( Kisalu et al . , 2018 ) . Moreover , it was previously reported that human anti-PfCSP antibody affinity is often directly associated with epitope cross-reactivity ( Murugan et al . , 2020 ) . While mAb 3D11 provides one such example in mice , further investigation is needed to determine whether favorable selection of cross-reactive clones during B cell maturation has evolved as a common mechanism of the immune response in mammals against Plasmodium CSP . Most residues that mediate mAb 3D11 contacts with the PbCSP repeat are germline-encoded; indeed , of nine affinity-matured residues in the HC and three in the KC , only three are involved in direct contacts with the antigen ( H . Trp50 , H . Val56 and K . Tyr27D ) . Due to the repetitive nature of the central repeat motifs , multiple antibodies bind simultaneously to one CSP protein and neighboring Fabs engage in homotypic interactions ( Imkeller et al . , 2018; Oyen et al . , 2018 ) . Our data suggest that somatic mutations of residues that partake in Fab-Fab contacts enhance homotypic interactions and indirectly improve the binding affinity of the mAb to CSP . In this respect , mAb 3D11 recognition of PbCSP resembles binding of some neutralizing human mAbs to PfCSP ( Imkeller et al . , 2018; Murugan et al . , 2020; Oyen et al . , 2018 ) . In human mAbs 311 ( Oyen et al . , 2018 ) and 1210 ( Imkeller et al . , 2018 ) , CDR3 regions of both heavy and light chains appear to play a considerable role in forming Fab-Fab contacts . Interestingly , in the case of mAb 3D11 , homotypic interactions are mainly mediated by residues localized in HCDR1 and −2 , KCDR1 , and FR3 regions of both the HC and KC , with little contribution from residues in the CDR3 regions ( with the exception of H . Tyr97 in HCDR3 and K . Phe94 in KCDR3 ) . Taken together , these findings indicate that homotypic interactions are a feature by which the mammalian immune system can robustly engage repetitive Plasmodium antigens with high affinity in various ways . Interestingly , recent studies have reported that Fab-Fab interactions occur in other antibody-antigen complexes , providing evidence that homotypic contacts can drive diverse biology: for example , homotypic interactions were found between two nanobodies bound to a pentameric antigen ( Bernedo-Navarro et al . , 2018 ) , and between two Rituximab antibodies bound to B cell membrane protein CD20 ( Rougé et al . , 2020 ) . Our cryoEM analysis also revealed how the PbCSP repeat , like that of PfCSP , can adopt a highly organized spiral structure upon mAb binding . Such spiral assembly of CSP was previously observed upon human mAb 311 Fab and IgG binding , which induced a PfCSP spiral with a greater diameter ( 27 Å ) and smaller pitch ( 49 Å ) compared to the 3D11-PbCSP complex ( 16 Å diameter and 51 Å pitch ) ( Oyen et al . , 2018; Figure 5—figure supplement 3 ) . Differences in the architecture between these two complexes can be attributed to the fact that mAbs 3D11 and 311 recognize their respective antigens in distinct conformations . Because different anti-CSP inhibitory antibodies can bind the repeat region in a variety of conformations ( Imkeller et al . , 2018; Kisalu et al . , 2018; Tan et al . , 2018; Triller et al . , 2017; Scally and Julien , 2018 ) , it is likely that many types of CSP-antibody assemblies exist . Further studies are needed to investigate whether the formation of such highly organized complexes is possible on the surface of live sporozoites and how antibody-CSP interactions occur in the context of polyclonal serum . These insights will be important for our structure-function understanding of the mechanisms employed by these repeat-targeting antibodies to inhibit sporozoite development , migration and infection of hepatocytes . 4 Materials and methods We performed all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the following peptides: ( NPNA ) 5 , KQPADGNPDPNANPN , NPDPNANPNVDPNANP , ( NVDPNANP ) 2NVDP , ( PPPPNPND ) 2 , ( PPPPNAND ) 2 , ( PAPPNAND ) 2 , and PPPPNPNDPAPPNAND as blocked monomers in water with 0 . 15 M NaCl . Each simulation system consisted of the respective peptide with an acetylated N-terminus and amidated C-terminus solvated in a dodecahedral box with side lengths of 4 . 9 nm . The systems were simulated using the program GROMACS 5 . 1 . 4 ( 67 , 68 ) with the CHARMM22* ( Piana et al . , 2011; Best and Hummer , 2009; Lindorff-Larsen et al . , 2012; Best and Mittal , 2010; MacKerell et al . , 1998 ) force field for the protein and the TIP3P ( Jorgensen et al . , 1983 ) water model . All simulations were performed with periodic boundary conditions at a constant pressure and temperature of 1 bar and 300 K , respectively . The LINCS algorithm was used to constrain all bond lengths ( Hess et al . , 1997; Hess , 2008 ) . A cut-oﬀ of 1 . 4 nm was used for Lennard-Jones interactions . The Particle-Mesh Ewald algorithm ( Darden et al . , 1993; Essmann et al . , 1995 ) was used to calculate long-range electrostatics interactions with a Fourier spacing of 0 . 12 and an interpolation order of 4 . The Nosé-Hoover thermostat ( Nosé , 1984; Hoover , 1985 ) was used for temperature coupling with the peptide and solvent coupled to two temperature baths and a time constant of 0 . 1 ps . The Parrinello-Rahman algorithm ( Parrinello and Rahman , 1981 ) was used for pressure coupling with a time constant of 2 ps . The integration step size was two fs and the system coordinates were stored every 10 ps . The simulations were performed for 300 ns for 20 independent replicas of ( NPNA ) 5 and 10 independent replicas of all other sequences . The initial structures of the peptides were selected from 10 ns simulations in which extended conformations of the peptides were collapsed in vacuo . The ﬁrst 100 ns of each trajectory were omitted as the time required for system relaxation based on the convergence analysis of the radius of gyration ( Rg ) shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 2 . This protocol resulted in a total of 4 μs of production time for the ( NPNA ) 5 dataset and a total of 2 μs of production time for the other systems , which was used to compute equilibrium ensemble properties . The peptide snapshots were generated with VMD ( Humphrey et al . , 1996 ) and the plots were created with Matplotlib ( Hunter , 2007 ) . The mAb 3D11 hybridoma cell line variable light and heavy chain antibody genes were sequenced ( Applied Biological Materials Inc ) . mAb 3D11 VK and VH regions were cloned individually into custom pcDNA3 . 4 expression vectors immediately upstream of human Igκ and Igγ1-CH1 domains , respectively . The resulting pcDNA3 . 4-3D11 Fab KC and −3D11 Fab HC or −3D11 Fab 58/73 HC plasmids were co-transfected into FreeStyle 293 F cells for transient expression using FectoPRO DNA Transfection Reagent , cultured in GIBCO FreeStyle 293 Expression Medium , and purified via KappaSelect affinity chromatography ( GE Healthcare ) , cation exchange chromatography ( MonoS , GE Healthcare ) , and size-exclusion chromatography ( Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL , GE Healthcare ) . The mAb 3D11 hybridoma cell line ( BEI Resources MRA-100 ) was cultured in GIBCO Hybridoma-SFM ( Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat#12045076 ) with 2 . 5–10% fetal bovine serum ( Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat#12483–020 ) . Cells were harvested and the supernatant containing 3D11 IgG was purified via Protein G affinity chromatography ( GE Healthcare ) and size-exclusion chromatography ( Superose 6 Increase 10/300 GL , GE Healthcare ) . Constructs of full-length PbCSP ( residues 24–318 ) , the PbCSP C-terminal domain ( residues 202–318; PbC-CSP ) and the PbCSP αTSR domain ( residues 263–318; PbCSP αTSR ) from strain ANKA ( NCBI reference sequence XP_022712148 . 1 ) were designed with potential N-linked glycosylation sites mutated to glutamine and cloned into pcDNA3 . 4 expression vectors with a His tag . The resulting pcDNA3 . 4-PbCSP-6xHis , -PbC-CSP-6xHis and -PbCSP-αTSR-6xHis plasmids were transiently transfected in FreeStyle 293 F cells using FectoPRO DNA Transfection Reagent , cultured in GIBCO FreeStyle 293 Expression Medium , and purified by HisTrap FF affinity chromatography ( GE Healthcare ) and size-exclusion chromatography ( Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL , GE Healthcare ) . FreeStyle 293 F cells ( Thermo Fisher Scientific 12338026 ) and 3D11 hybridoma cell line ( BEI Resources MRA-100 ) were authenticated and validated to be mycoplasma-free by their respective commercial entities . BLI ( Octet RED96 , FortéBio ) experiments were conducted to determine the binding kinetics of the 3D11 Fab to recombinant PbCSP . PbCSP , PbC-CSP or PbCSP αTSR was diluted to 10 µg/ml in kinetics buffer ( PBS , pH 7 . 4 , 0 . 01% [w/v] BSA , 0 . 002% [v/v] Tween-20 ) and immobilized onto Ni-NTA ( NTA ) biosensors ( FortéBio ) . After a steady baseline was established , biosensors were dipped into wells containing twofold dilutions of 3D11 Fab in kinetics buffer . Tips were then immersed back into kinetics buffer for measurement of the dissociation rate . Kinetics data were analyzed using the FortéBio’s Octet Data Analysis software 9 . 0 . 0 . 6 , and curves were fitted to a 2:1 binding model . Calorimetric titration experiments were performed with an Auto-iTC200 instrument ( Malvern ) at 37°C . Full-length PbCSP and PbCSP-derived peptides ( PAPP , NAND , NPND , Mixed , NPNDx1 , NPNDx2; GenScript ) were diluted in Tris-buffered saline ( TBS; 20 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , and 150 mM NaCl ) and added to the calorimetric cell . Titrations were performed with 3D11 Fab in the syringe , diluted in TBS , in 15 successive injections of 2 . 5 μl . Full-length PbCSP was diluted to 5 μM and titrated with 3D11 Fab at 400 μM . All PbCSP-derived peptides were diluted to 20 μM and titrated with 3D11 Fab at 200–300 μM; with the exception of the NPNDx2 peptide , which was diluted to 9–10 μM and titrated with 180–200 μM 3D11 Fab . Experiments were performed at least two times , and the mean and standard error of the mean are reported . The experimental data were analyzed using the MicroCal ITC Origin 7 . 0 Analysis Software according to a 1:1 binding model . Full-length PbCSP was complexed with a molar excess of 3D11 Fab and loaded on a Superose 6 Increase 10/300 GL ( GE Healthcare ) using an Agilent Technologies 1260 Infinity II HPLC coupled in-line with the following calibrated detectors: ( i ) MiniDawn Treos MALS detector ( Wyatt ) ; ( ii ) Quasielastic light scattering ( QELS ) detector ( Wyatt ) ; and ( iii ) Optilab T-reX refractive index ( RI ) detector ( Wyatt ) . Data processing was performed using the ASTRA software ( Wyatt ) . Purified 3D11 Fab was concentrated and diluted to 5 mg/mL with each of the PAPP , NAND and Mixed peptides in a 1:5 molar ratio; and diluted to 2 . 1 mg/mL with the NPND peptide in a 1:5 molar ratio . The 3D11 Fab/PAPP complex was mixed in a 1:1 ratio with 20% ( w/v ) PEG 3350 , 0 . 15 M malic acid pH 7 . Crystals appeared after ~1 d and were cryoprotected in 15% ( v/v ) ethylene glycol before being flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen . The 3D11 Fab/NAND complex was mixed in a 1:1 ratio with 20% ( w/v ) PEG 3350 , 0 . 2 M di-sodium tartrate . Crystals appeared after ~3 d and were cryoprotected in 15% ( v/v ) ethylene glycol before being flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen . The 3D11 Fab/NPND complex was mixed in a 1:1 ratio with 25% ( w/v ) PEG 3350 , 0 . 2 M lithium sulfate , 0 . 1 M Tris pH 8 . 5 . Crystals appeared after ~12 d and were cryoprotected in 20% ( v/v ) ethylene glycol before being flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen . The 3D11 Fab/Mixed complex was mixed in a 1:1 ratio with 25 . 5% ( w/v ) PEG 4000 , 15% ( v/v ) glycerol , 0 . 17 M ammonium acetate , 0 . 085 M sodium citrate pH 5 . 6 . Crystals appeared after ~1 d and were cryoprotected in 20% ( v/v ) glycerol before being flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen . Data were collected at the 23-ID-D or 23-ID-B beamline at the Argonne National Laboratory Advanced Photon Source , or at the 17-ID-1 beamline at the National Synchrotron Light Source II . All datasets were processed and scaled using XDS ( Kabsch , 2010 ) . The structures were determined by molecular replacement using Phaser ( McCoy et al . , 2007 ) . Refinement of the structures was performed using phenix . refine ( Adams et al . , 2010 ) and iterations of refinement using Coot ( Emsley et al . , 2010 ) . Access to all software was supported through SBGrid ( Morin et al . , 2013 ) . The PbCSP/3D11 complex was concentrated to 3 mg/mL and incubated briefly with 0 . 01% ( w/v ) n-Dodecyl β-D-maltopyranoside . 3 µl of the sample was deposited on homemade holey gold grids ( Marr et al . , 2014 ) , which were glow-discharged in air for 15 s before use . Sample was blotted for 12 . 5 s , and subsequently plunge-frozen in a mixture of liquid ethane and propane ( Tivol et al . , 2008 ) using a modified FEI Vitrobot ( maintained at 4°C and 100% humidity ) . Data collection was performed on a Thermo Fisher Scientific Titan Krios G3 operated at 300 kV with a Falcon 3EC camera automated with the EPU software . A nominal magnification of 75 , 000× ( calibrated pixel size of 1 . 06 Å ) and defocus range between 1 . 6 and 2 . 2 μm were used for data collection . Exposures were fractionated as movies of 30 frames with a total exposure of 42 . 7 electrons/Å2 . A total of 2080 raw movies were obtained . Image processing was carried out in cryoSPARC v2 ( Punjani et al . , 2017 ) . Initial specimen movement correction , exposure weighting , and CTF parameters estimation were done using patch-based algorithms . Manual particle selection was performed on 30 micrographs to create templates for template-based picking . 669 , 223 particle images were selected by template picking and individual particle images were corrected for beam-induced motion with the local motion algorithm ( Rubinstein and Brubaker , 2015 ) . Ab-initio structure determination revealed that most particles present in the dataset correspond to the 3D11 Fab-PbCSP complex , with a minor population of particles corresponding to unbound 3D11 Fab . After several rounds of heterogeneous refinement , 165 , 747 particle images were selected for non-uniform refinement with no symmetry applied , which resulted in a 3 . 2 Å resolution map of the 3D11 Fab-PbCSP complex estimated from the gold-standard Fourier shell correlation ( FSC ) criterion . To create a starting model of the 3D11 Fab-PbCSP complex , seven copies of 3D11 Fab/PbCSP-peptide crystal structures were manually docked into the 3D11 Fab-PbCSP cryoEM map using UCSF Chimera ( Pettersen et al . , 2004 ) , followed by manual building using Coot ( Emsley et al . , 2010 ) . All models were refined using phenix . real_space_refine ( Adams et al . , 2010 ) with secondary structure and geometry restraints . The final models were evaluated by MolProbity ( Chen et al . , 2010 ) . The figures were prepared with UCSF Chimera ( Pettersen et al . , 2004 ) and UCSF ChimeraX ( Goddard et al . , 2018 ) . Contacts in the 3D11 Fab-PbCSP complex were identified by PDBePISA ( Krissinel and Henrick , 2007 ) . To obtain soluble complexes of 3D11-IgG-PbCSP for NS analysis , 8 . 4 µg of PbCSP was incubated overnight with 20x molar excess of 3D11 IgG . After removal of aggregates via centrifugation , 3D11 IgG-PbCSP complexes were purified on a Superose 6 Increase 10/300 GL column ( GE Healthcare ) . Fractions containing complexes of 3D11 IgG-PbCSP were pooled and concentrated , and subsequently deposited at approximately 50 µg/mL onto homemade carbon grids and stained with 2% uranyl formate . Data were collected with a FEI Tecnai T20 electron microscope operating at 200 kV , and acquired with an Orius charge-coupled device ( CCD ) camera ( Gatan Inc ) at a calibrated 34 , 483X magnification , resulting in a pixel size of 2 . 71 Å . Particle picking , extraction and three rounds of 2D classification with 50 classes allowed were performed with cryoSPARC v2 ( Punjani et al . , 2017 ) ."}

We present this lens , called the Mesolens , with performance data and images from biological specimens including confocal images of whole fixed and intact fluorescently-stained 12 . 5-day old mouse embryos .", "plain language summary": "For hundreds of years , optical microscopes have allowed living tissues to be studied in fine detail . Unfortunately , the images captured through typical microscope lenses feature a compromise between the level of detail in the image and how much of a sample can be shown . For example , densely packed individual cells often cannot be distinguished in an image that shows an entire mouse embryo . To address this issue , McConnell et al . have developed a microscope lens called the Mesolens . This can magnify samples by up to four times in much higher detail than conventional lenses that produce the same magnification . McConnell et al . tested the Mesolens as part of a technique called confocal microscopy , which can reconstruct the three-dimensional structure of a sample by collecting images from different layers . The resulting images allowed individual cells to be distinguished in cultures of rat brain cells . Furthermore , images of 10–12 day old mouse embryos contained enough detail to reveal many of the structures found inside cells , and allowed the distribution of cells to be tracked in developing organs such as the heart . Ultimately , the Mesolens has the potential to be used in many different applications and could assist in the study of many biological processes . In the future , McConnell et al . will test how effectively the Mesolens works as part of other microscopy techniques .", "article": "1 Introduction During experiments with laser scanning confocal microscopes in the mid-1980s , it became obvious that the optical sectioning , which is the main advantage of the confocal method , did not work with the available low-magnification objectives , because of their low numerical aperture ( N . A . ) ( White et al . , 1987 ) . In specimens such as mouse embryos at the 10–12 . 5 day stage , when the major organs are developing ( Kaufman , 1992 ) , it was impossible to see individual cells in the interior despite the lateral ( XY ) resolution being sufficient . Since then , stitching and tiling of large datasets has proved to be possible using computer-controlled specimen stages , but this results in a checker board pattern in the final image due to inhomogeneity of illumination and focus height errors which often cannot be corrected by software . Commercial and open source software algorithms are available to perform stitching and tiling but inhomogeneities and problems with dataset registration are clearly visible ( Legesse et al . , 2015 ) . Because of the continuous scanning laser spot that we use with the Mesolens , we do not observe differences in fluorescence signal from one region of the image to another unless it is present in the specimen . More recently , methods to expand the tissue volume using synthetic polymers have been demonstrated , increasing the size of the sub-micron sized structures until they can be imaged by an ordinary low-magnification , low-resolution lens , but this inevitably results in some tissue distortion ( Chen et al . , 2015 ) . We decided that what was needed was a 4x magnification lens with an N . A . of approximately 0 . 5 , rather than the 0 . 1 or 0 . 2 currently available , to support imaging with sub-cellular resolution through the entire specimen . Off-the-shelf lenses with the right characteristics , for example camera lenses , which could be adapted for microscopy by placing the specimen in the plane intended for the camera sensor and forming a x4 image in what would normally be the object space , were found to be unsuitable because of poor aberration correction including high field curvature , particularly when focused deeply into specimens immersed in fluid . The most successful attempt with a camera lens has been made recently by Zheng , Ou and Yang ( Zheng et al . , 2013a; Ou et al . , 2016 ) who used a high-quality Pentax TV lens with an N . A . of approximately 0 . 3 to produce an image of a 10 mm diameter field with a lateral resolution of 1 . 56 µm . For samples such as a 10 day old mouse embryo , which is 2–3 mm thick , however , an immersion lens is needed for optically-sectioned imaging , so that the spherical aberration introduced when imaging from air and through thicker material than the thin coverslip for which the lens is designed does not destroy the optical performance as the light is focused into the specimen . Large-field of view ( FOV ) water-immersion lenses of great complexity have been developed for photolithography in the manufacture of semiconductor devices , but these work only with monochromatic light ( e . g . at a wavelength of 193 nm ) and a fixed object distance so they are not useful for biomedical imaging ( Matsuyama et al . , 2006 ) . Fourier Ptychographic Microscopy ( FPM ) can give a very wide field of view image with sub-micron resolution ( Zheng et al . , 2013b ) . However , the depth of focus is purposefully large ( ~0 . 3 mm ) in order to provide a large tolerance to microscope slide placement errors . This very large depth of focus is not suited to confocal laser scanning microscopy , where a small depth of focus is needed for optical sectioning of the imaged specimen . Also , the low N . A . lens used in wide-field FPM is for use in air only . While this is acceptable for thin tissue sections , restriction to air immersion would give dramatic fall-off in axial resolution performance at depth when imaging thick tissues because of spherical aberration , for which there are presently no correction collars or any other means of compensation . Furthermore , as noted by Zheng et al . the current FPM method is not a fluorescence technique . Therefore , while FPM gives high-resolution color images of thin specimens such as pathology slides , it is not suitable for fluorescence imaging of either thin or thick specimens in either 2D or 3D . Fluorescence Talbot microscopy is another method that can provide imaging over a large field of view . This usually involves placing the specimen in direct contact with the imaging sensor ( Pang et al . , 2013 ) , which , because of the requirement for immersion and mounting of specimens in high-index material , is impractical for thick tissue imaging . The work of Pang et al . overcomes this limitation ( Pang et al . , 2013 ) , and makes possible imaging of specimens spatially separated from the sensor with fluorescence contrast and an exceptionally wide field of view . However , while the lateral performance is good the reported depth of focus limit of 60 µm is too large to be useful for optically sectioning of thick tissue volumes . The imaging speed of 23 s of the instrument described by Pang et al . is attractive but the reported unevenness of Talbot spots over an area of 1 mm x 1 mm of 4 . 73% is very high when compared with both standard wide-field imaging and our wide-field imaging using the Mesolens . Tsai et al . have performed large FOV two-photon microscopy using a commercial low-magnification objective lens ( XL Fluor 4X/340 , N . A . =0 . 28 , Olympus ) , but they observe modest depth penetration and low axial resolution of 16 µm , as expected from the N . A . of the objective ( Tsai et al . , 2015 ) . Furthermore , for objectives designed for multi-photon imaging , the performance ( primarily colour correction ) at visible wavelengths is poor or unpublished . Serial two-photon tomography can provide very high lateral resolution images of the fluorescent mouse brain ( Oh et al . , 2014 ) . However , this imaging method requires the tissue to be destroyed because of the microtome sectioning needed and this makes repeat imaging impossible . More importantly , stitching and tiling of multiple datasets is required because of the large diameter of the tissue , and this can result in poor image registration and differences in fluorescence signal from one dataset to another . We finally note that some commercial microscopes are described as capable of imaging the same specimen from the macro-scale to the micro-scale ( e . g . AZ100 Multizoom , Nikon ) but at the low magnifications that permit imaging of large specimens , the N . A . of these microscopes is low , and thus the performance is as for a low N . A . objective . In this paper we present a cure for this problem . We describe a multi-immersion objective lens for wide-field epi-fluorescence and laser scanning confocal microscopy with a working distance of over 3 mm and a 6 mm FOV that is corrected for a wide range of wavelengths and demonstrate its advantages with large biological specimens . 2 Results For quantitative measurements of resolution , a special test target was prepared by electron beam lithography of a 75 nm thick nickel-chromium coating on glass ( Oldenbourg et al . , 1993 ) . The lateral image resolution was judged by the visibility of a series of gratings with periods of 2 µm , 1 µm , and 0 . 5 µm . In brightfield transmission mode using wide-field camera detection and in laser scanning confocal reflection mode using the 514 nm laser with photomultiplier tube ( PMT ) detection , the resolution was found to be better than 1 µm ( Figure 2 ) , with the 0 . 5 µm grating unresolved but the 1 µm grating clearly resolved . 10 . 7554/eLife . 18659 . 006Figure 2 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 18659 . 006 To evaluate the full point-spread function ( PSF ) we used yellow/green-emitting fluorescent beads . For comparison similar measurements were conducted with a conventional dry objective lens of similar magnification ( 5x/0 . 15 N . A HCX PL Fluotar , Leica Microsystems ) mounted on an upright microscope . The results are presented in Table 1 .

The astigmatic error was visible at the edges of the FOV . Nevertheless , the z resolution is , as we will demonstrate below , sufficient to resolve sub-cellular detail , and far superior to a standard objective lens with comparable magnification . To investigate whether the lower than theoretical diffraction-limited axial resolution was associated with the scan system and Mesolens , or arose only from the Mesolens , we performed measurements of the PSF in wide-field epi-fluorescence mode . The results are presented in Table 1 and shows that the z-resolution is 7 µm , which is only somewhat higher than the theoretical resolution ( 6 . 3 µm ) and there are some residual astigmatic aberrations . The lack of improvement of the axial resolution in laser scanning confocal mode is therefore likely due to aberrations in the scan lens and illumination system . Nevertheless , the laser scanning confocal mode still achieves optical sectioning not present with wide-field epi-fluorescence mode . The flatness of field was measured to be <=3 µm over the central 4 . 2 mm of the FOV in reasonable agreement with the design specifications . In order to make measurements of the relative optical throughput efficiency of the Mesolens as compared with a commercial low-magnification , low numerical aperture lens ( 4x/0 . 1 N . A . Plan , Nikon ) a light-emitting diode ( HLMP-2855 , Broadcom ) was used as a specimen of standard luminosity ( Beach and Duling , 1993 ) . The LED was driven at constant current and the intensity was monitored using a photodiode . The specimen was set up with the same CCD camera for the Mesolens in oil-immersion mode and the 4x/0 . 1 N . A . objective . Using the same exposure time the intensity with the Mesolens was found to be 25x that with the conventional objective , in good agreement with the 4 . 7 times higher N . A . available from the Mesolens . To measure the optical throughput we compared the laser power immediately after the beam splitter in the periscope ( see Figure 1 ) with the laser power at the specimen plane at a wavelength of 488 nm , and we measured an on-axis transmission of 11% . A significant loss results from overfilling the top mirror in the periscope , which is required in order to achieve the flattest possible wavefront . There are also additional losses from the scanning mirrors and in the scan lens . Although the optical throughput of a standard microscope objective can be several tens of percent , the transmission of the complete system is more similar to what we measure here . We also note that the transmission value of the complete system is rarely given explicitly by microscope manufacturers but , based on the quoted power of the laser system ( e . g . 50 mW for a Krypton-Argon laser operating at a wavelength of 488 nm ) and measuring the maximum average power at the specimen plane ( e . g . 3 mW after the objective lens ) , we measure a similar magnitude of optical loss with commercial confocal microscopes compared to the Mesolens . The good transmission of the Mesolens itself is also confirmed by our comparison of the transmission of the Mesolens with that of a 4x/0 . 1 N . A . lens in camera mode . Figure 3 and the Video 1 show wide-field epi-fluorescence data from an explant culture of rat embryonic brain as a colour merge of three camera images at the same focus position . In this preparation , the blue fluorescence is of nuclei stained for DNA with DAPI , neurones show green because of Alexa 488 conjugated to an antibody against beta-III tubulin and astrocytes are red because of Alexa 546 conjugated to anti-GFAP ( glial fibrillary acid protein ) . A custom multiband reflector ( Chroma ) was used with a multiband barrier filter and , for each image , a different excitation waveband was selected from a mercury arc lamp . This image clearly shows the excellent chromatic correction of the lens with all three colours simultaneously in focus . Furthermore , the image demonstrates the possibility to view both the full large FOV and tiny details in the same image , using only ( 17x ) software zoom . 10 . 7554/eLife . 18659 . 008Figure 3 .

The zoom is generated by software only . Halfway into the movie we have changed to a smaller format camera mounted on an image magnifier to achieve fine enough sampling . Note that this will not enhance the optical resolution of the image but was necessary to overcome the lack of a camera able to record hundreds of megapixels in a single image . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 18659 . 009 To demonstrate the superior sectioning capability of the Mesolens compared to a standard objective lens with comparable magnification , we imaged the same fixed , cleared and acridine orange-stained 10 day old mouse embryo with the Mesolens and with a dry objective lens of similar magnification ( 5x/0 . 15 N . A . HCX PL Fluotar , Leica Microsystems ) mounted on an upright laser scanning microscope . The embryo was lying on its side so that XY scanning produced an optical section that was anatomically sagittal . The XZ images are displayed in Figure 4a and b . Figure 4a was taken with a z-plane spacing of 1 . 5 µm and a line average of n=12 and Figure 4b has a plane spacing of 1 µm and no averaging . For both lenses , but acutely for the 5x/0 . 15 N . A . lens , this is much smaller than the size of the PSF . The Mesolens can image throughout the entire 2 mm thick embryo with sub-cellular resolution ( we can see individual nuclei all the way through ) . This is in contrast to the image with the commercial low magnification , low N . A . objective , where the long needle-like vertical structures indicate a very poor z resolution . The lateral resolution also remains micron-sized throughout the embryo , as can been seen from Figure 4c , which presents an XY cross section midway through the same embryo . In Figure 4b the dark cavity within the midbrain on the left and the neural canal within the spinal cord on the right are imaged with good axial resolution even though they are deep within the embryo , which is equally-well resolved at the top and bottom of the z range . Although the larger cavities are also visible in the image taken with the 5x lens , finer details such as the dark extracellular spaces in the bright neural tube to the right of the image and the epithelial cell monolayer ( upper right margin and left lower corner ) are only visible in the Mesolens image ( Figure 4b ) . In the XY section ( Figure 4c ) similar fine details including individual cell nuclei in all the tissues are clearly resolved . Structures within the embryo were identified by means of ( Kaufman , 1992 ) . The constant signal with increasing depth throughout the specimen arises from having a well-cleared specimen . We did not adjust the laser power or detector gain when imaging deeper into tissue . 10 . 7554/eLife . 18659 . 010Figure 4 . Optical sectioning of an optically-cleared and fluorescently-stained 10 day old mouse embryo .

( b ) is the same embryo imaged at the same region in XZ using the Mesolens with oil immersion . The Mesolens can image throughout the entire 2 mm thick embryo with sub-cellular resolution: individual nuclei can be observed all the way through . This is in contrast to the image with the commercial low magnification , low N . A . objective , where the long needle-like vertical structures indicate a very poor z resolution .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 18659 . 012 To demonstrate the capability of the instrument as a two-channel detection system , and to illustrate the very large FOV , we imaged 12 . 5 day old embryos , which cover nearly the full 6 mm FOV . This embryo was stained with an antibody against axonal beta tubulin coupled to the fluorescent dye Alexa 594 , to highlight nerve cells and with acridine orange , here used chiefly as a nuclear marker . A dual-colour single optical section of a 12 . 5 day embryo stained following this protocol is presented as Figure 5 , with a 3D rendering around one of the eyes of the embryo shown as Video 2 . A lower-quality , smaller version of the same data is available as Video 3 . In the 3D rendering there are 60 images axially separated by 3 . 33 µm , imaging a total thickness of 200 µm and we used the fluorescence mode of our image reconstruction software ( Volocity , Perkin Elmer ) which applies a direct opacity rendering . We can clearly identify fine structures throughout the embryo such as the developing heart muscle fibers and fine details in the eye such as the corneal endothelium . The inset shows a blow-up of the eye region revealing the individual cell nuclei . We emphasize that this image is only a software zoom from the full scan range of the confocal Mesolens system , not a smaller scanned region . In the eye , the lens was visible as a slightly absorbing structure with a sharply defined outline , surrounded in turn by cells within the aqueous humour and then the strongly-stained retina . All these structures were enclosed in the corneal stroma , lined on the inside with the corneal endothelium and on the outside with the epithelial precursor of the conjunctiva . 10 . 7554/eLife . 18659 . 013Figure 5 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 18659 . 016 To demonstrate that an outstanding axial resolution is retained over the full FOV with only a small degradation at the edges of the image we performed a two-color XZ image of the 12 . 5 day old embryo . This is presented in Figure 5—figure supplement 1 . 3 Discussion We have shown here that it is possible , using known design software and fabrication to exact tolerances , to design and construct an objective to facilitate imaging of objects up to 6 mm wide and 3 mm thick in their entirety with depth resolution of only a few microns instead of the tens of microns currently attained , allowing sub-cellular detail to be resolved . We call this lens the Mesolens . In doing this work we have departed from a design principle of more than a century , which is that the number of lateral resolution units in the field diameter should be approximately the same for all objectives . As we have shown here , the lateral resolution in the image field of this new lens is too great for the human eye , but suits cameras of the highest pixel number available or laser scanning confocal operation and , crucially , the axial resolution justifies the collection of several hundred optical sections of a thick specimen within the working depth . We have shown that single cells , including the nucleated erythrocytes of mouse embryos , and syncytial heart muscle fibres can be seen not just near the surface as with conventional objectives but throughout the depth of the embryo . A biologist can therefore discover whether , for example , a defect in development involves changes in the shape of a deep-located organ , or of cell shape or cell number , or of the nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio . No existing microscope can show all of these features simultaneously in an intact mouse embryo in a single image . With the Mesolens we also have the possibility of switching from a relatively slow laser scanning mode to fast camera mode with the large field of view in the same focal plane . This is not possible with higher magnification objective lenses . This is of value both in searching for rare image features , and in adjusting the compensation collars of the objective lens . We do not observe difficulty with the penetration of the acridine orange stain for the E10 embryos , although for the thicker 12 . 5 day old embryos this might be part of the reason for the reduced signal in the centre of the embryo seen in Figure 5—figure supplement 1a . If the volume of the point spread function of an objective lens to the first ellipsoidal minimum is divided into the total accessible 3D volume a measure of the number of resolved voxels can be obtained ( a quantity comparable to the Nyquist sample but for a 3D volume ) . The maximum size of a Mesolens dataset is approximately 200x that for a 100x/1 . 4 N . A . lens . Calculated from the data presented here for the Mesolens , a complete image sampled at Nyquist resolution over the 6 mm x 6 mm x 3 mm volume generates a 639 GB digital image , which is large but the capacity and speed of current computers can readily handle data files of this size . The ability to record such high-volume data makes it likely that many applications other than the imaging of mouse embryos will be found . Provided the problem of tissue transparency can be solved , there are obvious applications in neurobiology . Also , the Mesolens can reveal spatially rare events , and may have application in the measurement of the mitotic index in slowly-reproducing tissues . The 25x higher optical throughput could also facilitate imaging of weakly emitting specimens , for example specimens expressing fluorescent proteins at a low level or containing single cells bearing luciferase as a bioluminescent marker . Recently , a lens of similar numerical aperture to the Mesolens ( N . A . =0 . 6 ) with a field of 5 mm diameter and a collection depth of 1 mm has been described ( Sofroniew et al . , 2016 ) . However , this lens is corrected only for a narrow wavelength band ( 900–1070 nm ) and is restricted in use to single-spot multi-photon imaging , whereas the Mesolens can serve as a multi-wavelength camera lens , a confocal objective , and potentially also as a multi-photon objective , both single-spot and wide-field ( Amor et al . , 2016 ) . This development represents the most radical change in microscope objective design for over a century , and we believe that despite the fact that the Mesolens cannot be fitted to a conventional microscope stand , it has the potential to transform optical microscopy through the acquisition of sub-cellular resolution 3D datasets from large tissue specimens . 4 Materials and methods The excitation and detection beam path for laser scanning confocal microscopy with the Mesolens is illustrated in Figure 1 . The excitation light was provided by a fiber-coupled multi-line laser system ( Laserbank , Cairn Research ) , comprising 405 nm , 488 nm , 514 nm , 532 nm , 561 nm and 637 nm wavelengths . The laser was expanded using an f=−25 mm lens ( LC1054 , Thorlabs ) and an f=+125 mm lens ( LA1986-A , Thorlabs ) , propagated through an f=+50 mm lens ( LA1131-A ) and directed towards the scanning system using a periscope . An 80/30 beamsplitter ( PBSW-532 , Thorlabs ) formed the lower mirror of the 1 m periscope , and the top mirror ( Thorlabs BB2-E02 ) steered the beam towards a large-aperture f=+1000 mm achromatic doublet lens ( LA1779-A-ML , Thorlabs ) to collimate the light before reaching the scan mirrors . The scanning mirrors directed the light through the scan lens and the Mesolens focused the light into the specimen . The reflected light or fluorescence signal from the specimen was propagated back through the Mesolens , scan lens , scanning system and periscope , and was transmitted through the beamsplitter , chosen to transmit 80% of the ( unpolarised ) fluorescence emission and reflect 30% of the linearly polarized laser beam . The signal was collected using an f=+75 mm lens ( LA1608-A , Thorlabs ) and focused through the imaging iris using a non-infinity corrected 10x objective lens ( 10 OA 25 , Comar Optics ) . The total magnification of the system was 1440 , and the confocal iris was set to 1 Airy unit = 1 . 7 mm . A two-channel PMT system was built for two-colour imaging , with each PMT having its own imaging iris . The PMT used for the images in Figures 2b and 4b–c , and Figure 4—figure supplements 1 , 2 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1 was a PMM02 , ( Thorlabs ) and for Figure 5 and Video 2 a Senstech P30-09 was used for the red channel and Senstech P30-01 was used for the green channel . The bandpass filters were chosen to match the emission wavelengths of the fluorescent dyes in the specimen ( and were removed for reflection imaging ) . Images were digitized using a PCI-6110 ( National Instruments ) multifunction DAQ card with a 12 bit , 5 MHz , simultaneous sampling A/D converter and 16 bit , 4 MHz , D/A converter . For optimum scanning rate and stability , a sine wave scan waveform ( max . 66 Hz ) , was used , with the first half of each cycle digitized and remapped to obtain a linear image field . The system was controlled using an in-house , laser scanning software package , ‘Mesoscan’ , designed to handle 400 megapixel scanned images . Images were stored in the Open Microscopy Environment OME . TIFF format and analysed using ImageJ . The camera used to capture the bright field image in Figure 2 was a Nikon Ds-Qi1Mc mounted on top of an image magnifier with a 10x objective lens serving as the magnifying lens . Note that this will not enhance the optical resolution of the image but is a way around the lack of a camera with sub-micron pixel size as required for Nyquist sampling of the image . The same method is used for measuring the PSF using fluorescent beads in epi-fluorescence mode . The upright microscope used for comparing the resolution of the Mesolens to that of a low N . A . 5X lens was a Leica DM6000 , with an SP5 scanning unit ( Leica Microsystems ) . Wide-field epi-fluorescence measurements were made by using 470 nm from a mercury short–arc source for excitation . The point-spread function of the Mesolens in laser scanning confocal fluorescence mode with oil immersion was measured using 488 nm excitation . The yellow/green-emitting beads used for the resolution measurements were 500 nm diameter beads ( 17152–10 , Polysciences Inc . ) for the lateral resolution measurements in laser scanning confocal mode , and for the lateral and axial resolution measurements in wide-field epi-fluorescence mode for the Mesolens , and 1 µm diameter beads ( 18860–1 , Polysciences Inc . ) for the remaining resolution measurements respectively . To immobilize the beads they were dried down on to cleaned coverslips and immersed in a Gelvatol medium ( 341584 , Sigma-Aldrich ) containing DABCO ( diazo-bis-cyclo-octane , 290734 , Sigma-Aldrich ) as antifade . For the measurement in wide-field epi-fluorescence mode we used a 10x image magnifier as described above and a cooled CCD camera with 6 . 45 µm pixel size ( CoolSnap HQ2 , Photometrix ) . The flatness of field was measured in epi-fluorescence in oil immersion mode using 6 µm fluorescent beads ( 18862 , Polysciences Inc . ) dried down on the surface of a mirror serving as a flat substrate . A camera with a 35 mm sensor chip ( C3900-024 , Hamamatsu ) was placed directly on top of the Mesolens via an F-mount , and images were captured using the manufacturer’s software ( HCImage , Hamamatsu ) . Explant cultures of embryonic rat brain were prepared and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and stained as follows: The nuclei were stained with DAPI , the neurons were stained with Alexa 488 conjugated to an antibody against beta-III tubulin and astrocytes were stained with Alexa 546 conjugated to anti-GFAP . For the fluorescence imaging with this specimen a mercury lamp was used for excitation , with custom filters designed for DAPI , Alexa 488 and Alexa 546 ( Chroma ) . Two different cameras were used to image the same region ( Figure 3 , Video 1 ) . A low-power image was made by recording the entire field of the Mesolens on a monochrome 35 mm CCD chip with 10 megapixels , each of 9 µm square ( C3900-024 , Hamamatsu ) . Three images , using UV , blue or green excitation from the mercury lamp were merged and coded blue , green and red respectively . A high-power image was made with a small format color camera Nikon DSL1 ( used without a magnifier , in contrast to the resolution measurements described above ) , recording only a 2 . 2 mm x 1 . 6 mm portion of the Mesolens field with a square pixel size of 3 . 4 µm . The theoretical resolution of the Mesolens ( 0 . 6 µm ) corresponds to 2 . 4 µm in image space in the camera , so neither camera allowed Nyquist sampling . In the Video 1 , the wide-field epi-fluorescence image is first software-zoomed and then replaced by the image from the smaller format camera , which is further software zoomed and the view is software-panned around the region recorded in the small-format camera . This procedure was necessary to overcome the lack of a camera able to record hundreds of megapixels in a single image . For the 10 day old embryos in Figures 4 , Figure 4—figure supplements 1 and 2 , embryos were dissected from mouse uteri , fixed in ethanol: acetic acid 3:1 by volume overnight at 4°C and then transferred into aqueous media via a series of ethanol/water mixtures with decreasing ethanol content . The embryos were then stained overnight with acridine orange ( 0 . 05% in phosphate-buffered saline ) , rinsed overnight in PBS , dehydrated with ethanol solutions , cleared in xylene and mounted in Histomount ( Fisher Scientific ) . For the embryo presented in Figure 5 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1 embryos were dissected from mouse uteri , fixed in Dent’s Fix for 24 hr at 4°C , washed 3 times in PBS and then bleached in Dent’s Bleach ( for 24 hr ) at 4°C . Embryos were then rinsed 5 times in methanol , and fixed in Dent’s Fix ( for 24 hr ) at 4°C and stored at 4°C until staining . For antibody staining , embryos were rinsed 3 times in PBS , then washed 5 times in PBS for 1 hr per wash at room temperature . Mouse anti-Tubb3 ( beta-III-tubulin ) primary antibodies ( Sigma-Aldrich T5076-200UL; 1:250 concentration ) were applied in blocking solution ( Bovine Serum Albumin ( BSA ) ) , overnight at room temperature , after which the embryos were rinsed 3 times in PBS , then washed 5 times in PBS , for 1 hr per wash at room temperature . Subsequently , rabbit anti-mouse secondary antibodies ( 1:250 ) conjugated to Alexa 594 ( Invitrogen ) were applied in blocking solution ( BSA ) , overnight at room temperature , after which the embryos were rinsed 3 times in PBS , then washed 5 times in PBS , for 1 hr per wash at room temperature . For optical clearing , embryos were first dehydrated by removing half of the PBS and replacing with methanol for 5 min . They were then washed 3 times in methanol for 20 min per wash and then half of the methanol was removed and replaced with 1:2 benzyl alcohol:benzyl benzoate ( BABB ) for 5 min . Finally , embryos were cleared in 100% BABB overnight at 4°C and were stored in BABB at room temperature until re-staining with acridine orange . All the washing , staining and clearing steps were done with the sample on a rocker . The embryos were then stained with nuclear stain acridine Orange as follows . The embryos were transferred from BABB to PBS via a series of solvents . First , the embryo was transferred to xylene , and left to soak in several changes of xylene to remove the BABB over a period of days . It was then transferred from xylene to three changes of absolute ethanol , then 90% ethanol , 10% water by volume , then 75% ethanol , 50% ethanol and finally into distilled water ( with at least 10 min in each change ) . Acridine orange powder was dissolved in PBS to a pale yellow solution . The embryo was left in the staining solution overnight with gentle rolling on a slow turntable . The embryo was then washed in two changes of PBS over an hour and passed through the same series of alcohols up to xylene and then rolled in BABB overnight . These embryos were imaged in BABB . The images in Figures 4b , c , Figure 4—figure supplements 1 and 2 were acquired using 488 nm excitation with a power of ca 100 µW at the sample plane and the signal was detected using a 525/39 nm band pass filter . For Figure 4b/Figure 4—figure supplement 1 we used a pixel size of 1 µm x 1 µm ( XZ ) a scan speed of 22 lines per second and no frame averaging . For Figure 4c/Figure 4—figure supplement 2 we used a pixel size of 0 . 5 µm x 0 . 5 µm ( XY ) a scan speed of 22 lines per second and a frame average of 4 . The low line speed was necessitated by the low bandwidth of the PMT used for the images . The z-stack in Figure 5/Video 2/Video 3 was acquired using 488 nm excitation with a power of ca 50 µW at the sample plane and the signal was detected using a 525/39 nm band pass filter for imaging the acridine orange . We used 561 nm excitation with a power of approximately 150 µW at the sample plane and the signal was detected using a 600 nm long pass filter for imaging Alexa 594 . We used a pixel size of 1 µm x 1 µm x 3 . 33 µm ( XYZ ) , a scan speed of 45 lines per second and a frame average of 4 . The image for Figure 5—figure supplement 1 was acquired using 488 nm excitation with a power of ca 50 µW at the sample plane and the signal was detected using a 525/39 nm band pass filter for imaging the acridine orange . We used 561 nm excitation with a power of approximately 150 µW at the sample plane and the signal was detected using a 600 nm long pass filter for imaging Alexa 594 . We used a pixel size of 1 µm x 10 µm for XZ images and 1 µm x 1 µm for the XY images , a scan speed of 30 lines per second and a frame average of 2 . For the image in Figure 4a ( acquired on a Leica DM6000 microscope with an SP5 scanning unit ) we used a pixel size of 1 . 44 µm x 1 µm ( XZ ) and a scan speed of 400 lines per second , and a frame average of 12 ."}

Bacteriophages are a type of virus that invade bacteria; their name literally means ‘bacteria eater’ . The bacteriophage T7 , for example , infects the common bacteria known as Escherichia coli . Once inside , the virus hijacks the bacterium’s cellular machinery , using it to replicate its own genetic material and make more copies of the virus so it can spread . At the same time , the bacteria have found ways to try and defend themselves , which in turn has led some bacteriophages to develop countermeasures to overcome those defences . Many bacteria , for example , have restriction enzymes which recognise certain sections of the bacteriophage DNA and cut it into fragments . However , the T7 bacteriophage has one well-known protein called Ocr which inhibits restriction enzymes . Ocr does this by mimicking DNA , which led Ye et al . to wonder if it could also interrupt other vital processes in a bacterial cell that involve DNA . Transcription is the first step in a coordinated process that turns the genetic information stored in a cell’s DNA into useful proteins . An enzyme called RNA polymerase decodes the DNA sequence into a go-between molecule called messenger RNA , and it was here that Ye et al . thought Ocr might jump in to interfere . To begin , Ye et al . examined the structure of Ocr when it binds to RNA polymerase using an imaging technique called cryo-electron microscopy . Ocr has been well-studied before , its structure previously described , but not when attached to RNA polymerase . The analysis showed that Ocr gets in the way of specific molecules , called sigma factors , that show RNA polymerase where to start transcription . Ocr binds to RNA polymerase in exactly the same pocket as part of sigma factors do , which is also the place where DNA must be to be decoded to make messenger RNA . Ye et al . then performed experiments to show Ocr interfering with binding to RNA polymerase did indeed disrupt transcription . This means Ocr is quite versatile as it interferes with the RNA polymerase of the bacterial host and its restriction enzymes . Ocr’s strategy of mimicking DNA to interrupt transcription could be adopted as an approach to develop new antibiotics to stop bacterial infections . DNA transcription is an essential cellular process – without it , no cell can replicate and survive – and RNA polymerase is already a validated target for drugs . Following Ocr’s lead could provide a new way to stop infections , if the right drug can be designed to fit .", "article": "1 Introduction Bacteriophage T7 infects Escherichia coli and hijacks the host cellular machinery to replicate its genome ( Studier , 1972; Krüger and Schroeder , 1981; Hausmann and Messerschmid , 1988 ) . The T7 genome encodes 56 proteins with many functioning as structural proteins for the bacteriophage . A number of T7 proteins are known to specifically inhibit the bacterial cellular machinery . For example , proteins gp0 . 7 , gp2 and gp5 . 7 inhibit cellular transcription ( Cámara et al . , 2010; Tabib-Salazar et al . , 2018 ) whereas gp0 . 3 inhibits restriction/modification ( RM ) enzymes ( Studier , 1975 ) . Gp0 . 3 is the first T7 gene expressed after infection and T7 variants lacking gene 0 . 3 were shown to have genomes susceptible to E . coli RM systems ( Studier , 1975 ) . Subsequently the 117 amino acid protein gp0 . 3 was named Overcome Classical Restriction ( Ocr ) ( Krüger and Schroeder , 1981 ) . Ocr is abundantly expressed and forms a dimer that mimics the structure of a slightly bent 20 base pair B-form DNA ( Issinger and Hausmann , 1972; Walkinshaw et al . , 2002 ) and blocks the DNA binding grooves of the type I RM enzyme , preventing the degradation and modification of the T7 genome by the host . Intriguingly , Type I RM enzymes are present in very low numbers ( estimated at ~60 molecules per cell [Kelleher and Raleigh , 1994] ) . Since Ocr is a DNA mimicry protein , it is possible that the abundantly expressed Ocr ( estimated to be several hundreds of molecules per cell at least ) ( Hausmann and Messerschmid , 1988 ) also interferes with other DNA processing systems of the host . Indeed early evidence of an interaction between Ocr and the host RNA polymerase ( RNAP ) was obtained using pull-down affinity chromatography ( Ratner , 1974 ) . RNA polymerase is the central enzyme for transcription , which is a highly controlled process and can be regulated at numerous distinct functional stages ( Kornberg , 1998; Decker and Hinton , 2013 ) . The large majority of transcription regulation , however , is executed at the recruitment and initiation stage ( Browning and Busby , 2004; Hahn and Young , 2011; Browning and Busby , 2016 ) . To ensure transcription specificity , bacterial RNAP relies on sigma ( σ ) factors to recognise gene-specific promoter regions . E . coli has seven sigma factors which can be grouped into two classes , the σ70 class represented by σ70 , responsible for transcribing housekeeping genes , and the σ54 class , responsible for transcribing stress-induced genes including phage infection ( Feklístov et al . , 2014; Browning and Busby , 2016 ) . Much work has yielded a detailed mechanistic understanding of how transcription directed by σ70 and σ54 is initiated ( Zhang et al . , 2012; Glyde et al . , 2018 ) . Specifically , the two large RNAP subunits β and β’ form a crab claw structure that encloses the DNA binding cleft , accommodating the transcription bubble and the downstream double-stranded ( ds ) DNA ( Bae et al . , 2015; Zuo and Steitz , 2015 ) . Inhibiting host transcription is widely exploited by bacteriophages including T7 on E . coli and P23-45 on T . thermophilus ( Tagami et al . , 2014; Tabib-Salazar et al . , 2017; Ooi et al . , 2018 ) . Gp0 . 7 , gp2 and gp5 . 7 of T7 were shown to inhibit bacterial RNAP ( Cámara et al . , 2010; Tabib-Salazar et al . , 2017 ) . Gp0 . 7 is a protein kinase that phosphorylates the E . coli RNAP-σ70 , resulting in transcription termination at sites located between the early and middle genes on the T7 genome , gp2 specifically inhibits σ70-dependent transcription initiation and gp5 . 7 inhibits σS , responsible for stationary phase adaptation ( Bae et al . , 2013; Tabib-Salazar et al . , 2018 ) . Two proteins gp39 and gp76 of bacteriophage P23-45 were shown to inhibit T . thermophilus transcription ( Tagami et al . , 2014; Ooi et al . , 2018 ) . Importantly , RNAP is a validated antibacterial target and novel inhibitors of RNAP hold promise for potential new antibiotic development against antimicrobial resistance ( Ho et al . , 2009; Srivastava et al . , 2011; Ma et al . , 2016 ) . In this work , we investigate the potential effects of Ocr on the host transcriptional machinery . Our results with purified components show that Ocr can bind to RNAP and inhibit both σ70 and σ54 dependent transcription . Specifically we establish that an Ocr competes with sigma binding , thus affecting recruitment and can inhibit transcription both in vitro and in E . coli cells when over-expressed . Using structural biology , we show that the Ocr dimer directly binds to RNAP at the RNAP cleft , where sigma factors and the transcription bubble bind , suggesting that Ocr interferes with transcription recruitment by competing with sigma factor binding , and could also interfere with transcription initiation . Our work thus reveals the detailed molecular mechanisms of how Ocr could potentially affect the host through inhibiting transcription in addition to its role in knocking out host restriction and modification . These new structural details of RNAP-Ocr complexes allow comparisons with known transcription initiation complexes and other phage proteins suggesting new avenues to be exploited for inhibiting bacterial transcription and combating antibiotic resistance . 2 Results An early study by Ratner ( 1974 ) showed that upon T7 infection , Ocr protein was detected in pull-down experiments using host RNAP as bait , suggesting that Ocr could associate with the host transcriptional machinery . To assess if Ocr can engage with RNAP directly , we carried out in vitro interaction studies using purified components ( Figure 1 , Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . We observed that purified Ocr co-eluted with RNAP in gel filtration experiments , suggesting a tight interaction of RNAP and Ocr sufficient to withstand the lengthy elution time of the complex during chromatography ( Figure 1A–C ) . The complex persisted for the order of minutes during chromatography , suggesting a stable complex . To quantify the interactions , we carried out binding experiments between RNAP and Ocr using microscale thermophoresis ( MST ) . Our results show the binding affinity ( dissociation constant , Kd ) is in the order of 10 nM , similar to that of RNAP with sigma factors ( Figure 1D–F ) . These results thus confirm the basis for the RNAP-Ocr interaction originally observed ( Ratner , 1974 ) . Our observed affinity of Ocr for RNAP is about three orders of magnitude lower than the values reported for the association of Ocr with the EcoKI type I restriction modification enzyme ( Atanasiu et al . , 2002 ) as would be expected if the type I RM enzyme was the primary target for Ocr . In order to understand how Ocr interacts with RNAP , we subjected the purified complex from size-exclusion chromatography to cryo electron microscopy ( cryoEM ) single particle analysis . After several rounds of 2D classification , which allowed us to remove ice contaminations , very large particles or particles much smaller than RNAP , the remaining particles were subject to 3D classifications using the structure of the RNAP filtered to 60 Å as an initial model ( PDB code 6GH5 , Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) . Two classes with clear density for Ocr were refined to a global resolution 3 . 7 and 3 . 8 Å respectively although the quality is not uniform in the reconstruction , as demonstrated in the resolution distribution . Two resolution zones seem to be evident , around 3–4 Å and around 7–8 Å , reflecting the structural features of the complex ( some domains are mobile ) and partly due to preferential orientations of the particles ( Figure 2 , Figure 2—figure supplement 2 and Figure 2—figure supplement 3 ) . The electron density for RNAP is clearly resolved and two distinct structural models of RNAP ( taken from PDB code 6GH6 and 6GH5 ) can be readily fitted into the two reconstructions ( Figure 2 and Figure 2—figure supplement 3A ) . The remaining density region that is not accounted for by RNAP can accommodate an Ocr dimer ( Figure 2—figure supplement 3A ) . The density for Ocr is of sufficient quality that allows accurate positioning of the Ocr atomic structure ( PDB code 1S7Z ) ( Figure 2—figure supplement 3B–3C ) . The regions with the highest resolution within the reconstruction are in the RNAP core ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2 ) , where density for many side chains is clearly visible ( Figure 2—figure supplement 3C ) . During 3D classification , it is clear that a number of different conformational and structural classes exist within the dataset and two distinct classes were identified due to their widely differing RNAP clamp conformations ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) . Bacterial RNAP consists of five subunits forming a crab claw shape with the two large subunits β and β’ forming the claws ( or clamp ) which enclose the RNAP channel that accommodates the transcription bubble and downstream double-stranded ( ds ) DNA . The RNAP clamp is highly dynamic and single-molecule Forster Resonant Energy Transfer data have shown that the RNAP clamp adapts a range of conformations from closed to open involving more than 20 Å movement and 20o rotation of the clamp ( Chakraborty et al . , 2012 ) . Our recent structural work showed that specific clamp conformations are associated with distinct RNAP functional states with the widely opened clamp conformation associated with the DNA loading intermediate state ( Glyde et al . , 2018 ) . In both of the distinct RNAP-Ocr complex structures , Ocr remains as a dimer upon binding to RNAP ( Figure 2A–B ) and the Ocr dimers are slightly less bent compared to that of an Ocr alone crystal structure ( Figure 2—figure supplement 4 ) . In one structure , the entire Ocr dimer inserts deeply into the RNAP cleft , occupying the full RNAP nucleic acid binding channel including where the transcription bubble and the downstream DNA resides in the transcriptional open and transcribing complex ( Figure 2A , Figure 2C , Figure 3A ) . In this interaction mode , the RNAP clamp is wide open and both Ocr subunits are involved in the interactions ( Figure 2A , Figure 3B , Figure 2—figure supplement 3 ) , we thus denote it as the ‘wide clamp structure’ . The second structure involves only one of the two Ocr subunits within the dimer contacting RNAP , occupying only the downstream DNA channel . Here the RNAP clamp is less open and we denote this structure the ‘narrow clamp structure’ ( Figure 2B , Figure 2—figure supplement 3 ) . In the wide clamp structure , the RNAP clamp conformation is very similar to the conformation observed in the transcription initiation intermediate complex where the clamp is wide open and DNA is partially loaded into the cleft Glyde et al . , 2018 ) . In this structure , the Ocr dimer inserts into the RNAP channel and each of the two Ocr subunits , which we term proximal and distal , and makes distinct interactions with RNAP . The proximal subunit is deeply embedded in the RNAP cleft and occupies the space for the template strand DNA , the complementary newly synthesised RNA and the non-template strand DNA ( Figure 2 and Figure 3 , magenta [Bae et al . , 2015; Zuo and Steitz , 2015; Glyde et al . , 2018] ) . The distal Ocr subunit occupies the position of the downstream DNA ( Figure 2 and Figure 3A , yellow ) . The negatively charged surface of the proximal Ocr complements the highly positively charged surface of the surrounding RNAP and fits snugly into the channel formed by β and β’ subunits ( Figure 3C–E ) . The distal Ocr subunit mimics the downstream DNA in its interactions with the β’ clamp . Superposition of the β’ clamp in the RNAP-Ocr structure with that of initial transcribing complex shows the distal Ocr monomer aligns with downstream dsDNA in the initial transcribing complex ( Figure 3B ) . However , the Ocr dimer has a rigid conformation that resembles a bent B-DNA . Consequently , in order to maintain the interactions between both Ocr subunits and RNAP , the β’ clamp has to open up ( to ~58 Å in RNAP-Ocr from ~35 Å in RPo ) to accommodate the Ocr dimer compared to RPo that accommodates a transcriptional bubble and dsDNA ( Figure 2 ) . In the narrow clamp mode , the proximal Ocr subunit interacts with the β’ clamp , again mimicking downstream DNA in RPo although the clamp is more open ( ~45 Å ) compared to that in RPo ( ~35 Å ) ( Figure 2B–C ) . Interestingly , although an Ocr monomer surface mimics that of a dsDNA in the overall dimension and the negative charge distributions , the Ocr subunit in the narrow clamp structure does not exactly overlay with the downstream dsDNA in RPo when RNAP is aligned on its bridge helix , the highly conserved structural feature that is close to the active centre and connects β and β’ clamps ( Figure 4A ) . Instead Ocr is shifted upwards compared to the dsDNA in RPo ( Figure 4A ) . Inspecting the structures of Ocr and RNAP explain the differences . The downstream binding channel of RNAP consists of β and β’ clamps on two sides and the β’ jaw domain as a base , providing a positively charged environment on three sides , required to accommodate and engage with the negatively charged DNA during transcription ( Figure 4B ) . Although an Ocr monomer has a largely negatively charged surface , there are also positively charged patches on the Ocr surface , especially those facing the β’ jaw domain ( Figure 4C ) . In order to maintain the interactions between Ocr and the β’ clamp and to overcome charge repulsions with the β’ jaw , the β’ clamp is opened up , shifting Ocr upwards and away from the jaw domain . In order to understand the significance of Ocr binding to RNAP , we investigated the effects of Ocr on in vitro transcription using short-primed RNA ( spRNA ) assays performed on various promoter DNAs ( see Materials and methods ) . To determine the effect of Ocr on RNAP-σ70 transcription activity we performed in vitro transcription assays using different promoters and promoter variants such as linear σ70 promoter , or lacUV5 promoter ( Cámara et al . , 2010 ) as well as a T7A1 supercoiled promoter ( Figure 5A–B , Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) . Our data reveal that adding 5 μM Ocr decreased activity of RNAP-σ70 on the different promoters in the range of 70–10% . On the linear promoter in the presence of 5 μM Ocr the amount of spRNA was significantly reduced ( to 10–30% ) when Ocr was added prior to or after the holoenzyme formation but before DNA was added ( Figure 5A-B I-II ) . However , the effect of Ocr after DNA was added was less pronounced ( Figure 5A–B III ) . Ocr did not abolish transcription on the supercoiled T7A1 promoter at the same extent as on the linear promoters , indicating a role for DNA topology and perhaps the energy barriers of DNA opening in open complex formation and the promoter sensitivity to Ocr ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1C I-III ) . The effect of Ocr on the major variant RNAP-σ54 dependent transcription was also assessed using different variants of Sinorhizobium meliloti nifH promoter including linear and supercoiled DNA ( Chaney and Buck , 1999; Glyde et al . , 2018 ) , ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1A , B ) . The phage shock protein F ( PspF1-275 ) was used as an activator of RNAP-σ54 transcription to promote open complex formation ( see Materials and methods ) . Again , on both linear and supercoiled nifH promoters the RNAP-σ54 complexes were sensitive to Ocr ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) . Our results show that Ocr can efficiently inhibit transcription in vitro . We next tested to see if expression of Ocr in cells could indeed exhibit an effect in cells . We used E . coli MG1655 cells expressing Ocr from a plasmid vector under the control of an arabinose-inducible promoter and a range of growth conditions ( Supplementary file 1 ) . An Ocr-mediated growth inhibition effect was indeed observed in minimal modified M9 media ( Figure 5C ) . The effects were further assessed using the chromosomal β-galactosidase gene as a reporter . During the 5 hr period following induction with IPTG , a ~ 10 fold decrease of normalised β-galactosidase activity was observed in E . coli cells expressing Ocr compared to cells that do not express Ocr ( Figure 5D ) . Moreover , at 15 hr post-induction , upon induction , there was a 4-fold increase of normalised β-galactosidase activity in cells not expressing Ocr , while the β-galactosidase activity in cells expressing Ocr was lower overall and the observed increase upon induction was less than 2-fold ( Figure 5—figure supplement 2A ) . Subsequent measurements of lacZ mRNA using reverse transcription followed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( RT-qPCR ) showed that the observed β-galactosidase activity is concomitant with lacZ mRNA levels ( Figure 5—figure supplement 2B ) , confirming that Ocr was inhibitory for transcription in cells . Since Ocr interfered with transcription , we wanted to investigate whether it does so through interfering with RNAP recruitment by sigma and/or other processes required for transcription . Specifically , we probed the ability of Ocr in interfering with RNAP- σ holoenzyme and holoenzyme-promoter complex formation ( recruitment ) and pre-formed open complex , which is competent for transcription , thus allowing us to assess the effects on elongation . Using purified components and gel mobility shift assays , Ocr was observed to inhibit RNAP-σ70 holoenzyme formation in a concentration dependent fashion and irrespective of whether Ocr is added before or after σ ( Figure 6A and B , comparing lane 6 with 7–10 ) . Direct competition experiments with pre-formed RNAP-σ70 holoenzyme show that appearance of a RNAP-Ocr complex accompanies the disappearance of the RNAP-σ70 holoenzyme , ( Figure 6A and B , comparing lane 6 with lanes 11–12 ) . Indeed , MST experiment of Ocr binding to RNAP-σ70 revealed that Ocr can displace σ70 with an apparent Kd of ~20 nM ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1C ) . This is also consistent with data showing that RNAP has similar affinities for Ocr and σ ( Figure 1D–F ) . We next assessed the ability of Ocr in inhibiting recruitment to the promoter DNA by monitoring the amount of DNA bound holoenzymes using two different promoters ( Figure 6C–D ) . Ocr clearly inhibits the formation of a RNAP-σ70-DNA complex in a concentration dependent manner . Adding 5 μM Ocr either before or after σ addition resulted in ~30% promoter complex formation ( Figure 6C–D , I–II ) . Adding Ocr after DNA has only limited effects ( Figure 6C–D III ) . This is consistent with the higher binding affinity between RNAP-σ and DNA ( 0 . 1 nM for σ70 and 3 nM σ54 ) ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1 ) compared to RNAP-Ocr ( Figure 1D ) . These results are in excellent agreement with those in vitro transcription assay ( Figure 5 ) . Similar effects were observed for RNAP-σ54 ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1 ) . Due to the lower sensitivity of the diffused σ54 band to Coomassie blue staining , the displaced free σ54 from the RNAP-σ54 holoenzyme was observed by western blotting with an antibody to the His-tag on σ54 . Together our binding experiments and in vitro transcription assays support the proposal that Ocr inhibits RNAP recruitment to the promoter DNA by directly competing with σ for RNAP binding . However , Ocr has only limited effects on pre-formed RNAP-σ-DNA complexes . This is similar to the interactions of Ocr with a type I RM enzyme where Ocr only affects the enzyme when not bound to DNA ( Bandyopadhyay et al . , 1985 ) . 3 Discussion Our data here characterise a new activity for Ocr in inhibiting the host transcriptional machinery in addition to its established role in inhibiting the type I RM systems of the host . Thus , Ocr is a bifunctional DNA mimic protein . The in vitro transcription assay and Ocr competition experiments clearly show that Ocr can inhibit σ binding and recruitment of RNAP to promoter DNA . Our data using a reporter assay also demonstrate the ability of Ocr in inhibiting in vivo the E . coli transcription machinery . The structures of Ocr-RNAP show that Ocr occupies the space where σ binds ( Figure 7A–B ) and where the transcription bubble and downstream DNA reside in the open complex and elongation complex , thus explaining how Ocr inhibits RNAP recruitment by σ ( Vassylyev et al . , 2007; Zuo and Steitz , 2015 ) . Our data suggest an answer to the puzzle of why Ocr is so abundantly overexpressed immediately upon a T7 infection ( Issinger and Hausmann , 1972; Studier , 1975 ) , when its high affinity classical target , the Type I RM enzyme , is present in very low numbers ( estimated at ~60 molecules per cell , [Kelleher and Raleigh , 1994] ) . The very tight binding between Ocr and Type I RM enzymes ensures complete inhibition of restriction and modification . It would appear from our data that the excess Ocr molecules could then start the process of shutting down host transcription by binding to any non-transcribing RNAP . An earlier study by McAllister and Barrett used host strains lacking the host restriction systems , thus eliminating the effects of Ocr on host restriction enzymes . They showed that expression of gp0 . 3 ( Ocr ) resulted in a delayed inhibition of host β-galactosidase synthesis and delayed inhibition of total RNA synthesis ( McAllister and Barrett , 1977 ) . This inhibitory effect is consistent with our studies here showing that Ocr can inhibit host transcription . Since Ocr is expressed by host RNAP , it thus takes time for a sufficient amount of Ocr to be synthesized by the host , resulting in the delayed response . Indeed , Ocr could bind to free RNAP and/or potentially compete with host σ70 which are in the range of hundreds of molecules per cell ( https://pax-db . org/dataset/511145/137/ ) , since their binding affinities to RNAP are similar ( Figure 1D–F ) and Ocr can compete with σ70 for RNAP binding and promoter DNA binding ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1C ) . Interestingly , when Ocr and gp1 . 1 ( a small protein with unknown function ) were both expressed , the host protein synthesis was shutdown effectively , suggesting that gp1 . 1 and Ocr might have complementary/synergetic effects . The bifunctionality observed in Ocr may also be shared by other DNA mimic proteins . For example , the phage T4 Arn protein targeting the McrBC restriction enzyme also has weak interaction with histone-like protein H-NS ( Ho et al . , 2014 ) . Arn is very similar in shape to Ocr but since T4 requires the host RNAP throughout its life cycle it is unlikely to target RNAP as strongly as Ocr . Additional functions may also exist for other DNA mimics like phage λ Gam protein ( Wilkinson et al . , 2016 ) and the recently discovered anti-CRISPR proteins ( Wang et al . , 2018 ) . How the multifunctionality of these proteins are utilised by phage is an interesting topic for further study . Several other bacteriophage proteins inhibit transcription . These include T7 gp2 and gp5 . 7 , which inhibits E . coli RNAP , and P23-45 gp39 and gp76 , which inhibit T . thermophilus transcription . Structural and biochemical studies show that gp2 specifically inhibits σ70-dependent transcription through the interactions and stabilisation of the position of the inhibitory region 1 . 1 of σ70 , between the β and β’ clamps at the rim of the downstream DNA binding channel ( Figure 7B; Bae et al . , 2013 ) . Gp39 binds at region 4 of σA and restricts its conformation so that it is unable to bind to −35 promoter regions ( Figure 7C; Tagami et al . , 2014 ) . Gp76 on the other hand , binds deeply in the RNAP cleft , preventing open complex formation as well as transcription elongation ( Figure 7D; Ooi et al . , 2018 ) . However , the binding site of gp76 is adjacent to , but not overlapping the σ70 region σ3 . 2 , thus gp76 does not inhibit holoenzyme formation ( Figure 7D ) . In all the cases above , the bacteriophage proteins do not inhibit holoenzyme formation . Ocr on the other hand , inhibits holoenzyme formation per se and can disrupt a pre-formed holoenzyme ( Figure 6A–B , Figure 6—figure supplement 1 , Figure 7A ) . In addition , Ocr can also inhibit open complex formation but is unable to effectively disrupt pre-formed open complex ( Figure 6 ) . Ocr was shown to mimic a dsDNA in both shape and charge distribution ( Walkinshaw et al . , 2002 ) and an Ocr dimer mimics a slightly bent B-form DNA . Ocr has been shown to occupy the DNA binding grooves of type I RM enzymes through specific interactions , thus preventing viral DNA from being degraded or modified by the host RM system ( Atanasiu et al . , 2002; Kennaway et al . , 2009 ) . The structural model of the archetypal Type I RM enzyme EcoKI ( Kennaway et al . , 2009 ) shows a close association of Ocr with the M . EcoKI modification methyltransferase core of the Type I RM enzyme in that Ocr is completely encircled by the enzyme , similar to DNA encircled by a DNA clamp ( Kennaway et al . , 2012; Walkinshaw et al . , 2002 ) ( PDB 1S7Z ) . Ocr , on the other hand , binds in the cleft , surrounded on three sides by RNAP . Therefore it is not surprising that both Ocr-RNAP and Ocr-M . EcoKI complexes are sufficiently stable to persist during lengthy size exclusion chromatography experiments ( Figure 1 and Atanasiu et al . , 2002 ) . In this work , we show that Ocr remains as a dimer and binds at the downstream DNA channel of RNAP via the complementary charge interactions between the positively charged RNAP channel and the negatively charged Ocr dimer . However , due to the extensive positively charged surface within RNAP , the binding is not specific . Indeed , two distinct binding modes have been detected which allow either the proximal or distal Ocr monomer to interact with the positively charged β’ clamp . The RNAP clamp opens up in the ‘wide clamp’ binding mode in order to accommodate the Ocr dimer conformation while maintaining the charge complementarity , both deep inside the cleft and with the β’ clamp . When the clamp is closed as in the transcriptional open complex , even though there is ample space to accommodate one Ocr subunit , the charge repulsion between the β’ jaw domain and the Ocr surface results in the opening of the β’ clamp , thus shifting Ocr upwards and away from the β’ jaw domain . These structures demonstrate that the structural flexibility of RNAP clamp plays a key role in its ability to accommodate Ocr . A study of the kinetics of the formation of the complexes between Ocr and RNAP would be interesting and may show multiple consecutive reactions as found for the interaction of a small DNA mimic Uracil glycosylase inhibitor ( UGI ) with uracil glycosylase ( Bennett et al . , 1993 ) . The interactions and structures of Ocr with RNAP observed here suggest that Ocr could potentially interact and inhibit other DNA processing enzymes through a series of non-specific interactions with dsDNA binding sites/channels . However , the rigidity and the bent conformation of the Ocr dimer imposes constraints on the binding sites , which are optimised for the RM enzymes it inhibits but can still be accommodated by the structurally flexible RNAP DNA binding channel . The rigidity of the dimer is defined by the interactions between the Ocr subunits . Work presented here suggests that Ocr could be modified to fine-tune its DNA mimicry for binding to specific DNA processing proteins , either by reducing the rigidity of the dimer or changing the bend angle to create a new dimer interface . DNA mimicry has been proposed as a potential effective therapeutic tool ( Putnam and Tainer , 2005; Dryden , 2006; Roberts et al . , 2012 ) , Ocr could thus be exploited to create specific variants that can target specific DNA binding proteins , especially those that are shown to be antibiotic targets . In addition , our data here show that Ocr can effectively inhibit transcription under stress conditions when transcriptional activity is reduced . It is thus possible that during other growth conditions/phases , such as stationary phases or persistence , Ocr could be effectively utilised to inhibit transcription and thus diminish bacterial survival . 4 Materials and methods E . coli RNA polymerase was purified as previously reported ( Yang et al . , 2015 ) . As well as being purified as previously described ( Sturrock et al . , 2001 ) , Ocr was ligated into pOPINF vector with a N-terminal His-tag . Three purification steps ( Ni-NTA affinity , Heparin , and Gel filtration chromatography ) were employed , which generated homogeneous Ocr protein as judged by SDS-PAGE gel . The RNAP-Ocr complex was purified by gel filtration chromatography . Initially RNAP ( final concentration 14 . 5 µM ) and Ocr ( all Ocr concentrations are for the dimeric form , final concentration 58 . 0 µM ) were mixed at a 1:4 molar ratio in a 150 µl reaction volume and the mixture ( 150 µl ) was incubated on ice for 30 mins before being loaded onto the gel filtration column with a flowrate of 0 . 3 ml/min ( Superose 6 10/300 , GE Healthcare ) and eluted in buffer containing 20 mM Tris pH8 . 0 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM TCEP , 5 mM MgCl2 . The fractions were run on SDS-PAGE and the presence of Ocr was confirmed by Western blot against the His-tag . The same amount and concentration of RNAP and Ocr alone were also loaded on a Superose 6 10/300 column separately as a control . All MST experiments were performed using a Monolith NT . 115 instrument ( NanoTemper Technologies , Germany ) at 22 °C . PBS ( 137 mM NaCl , 2 . 7 mM KCl , 10 mM Na2HPO4 , 1 . 8 mM KH2PO4 ) supplemented with 0 . 05% Tween-20 was used as MST-binding buffer for all experiments . In all cases hydrophobic treated capillaries were used . σ54 , σ54-R336A and σ70 were purified to homogeneity similarly as described previously ( Nechaev and Severinov , 1999; Yang et al . , 2015 ) . σ54-R336A and σ70 holoenyzme were individually produced with gel filtration chromatography by mixing RNAP and σ with 1:4 molar ratio and incubating on ice for half an hour before loading to superpose 6 10/300 column . Ocr , σ54 , and σ70 , σ54-R336A -RNAP holoenzyme and σ70-RNAP holoenzyme were all His tagged and labelled with the kit ( Monolith His-Tag Labeling Kit RED-tris-NTA 2nd Generation ) separately . The labelled Ocr and sigma factors were diluted to a concentration of 50 nM and mixed with an equal volume of a serial dilution series of RNAP incubated at room temperature for 20 min before loading into MST capillaries thus giving a final concentration of 25 nM for Ocr and the sigma factors in the direct titration of RNAP . For Ocr competitive binding with σ70 holoenzyme , 50 nM of his-labeled σ70 holoenzyme , diluted in MST-binding buffer , was mixed with equal volumes of a dilution series of Ocr in MST-binding buffer . For DNA with holoenzyme binding affinity , linear promoter DNA ( Zuo and Steitz , 2015 ) was used σ70 and a nifH promoter with mismatch DNA between -10 and -1 ( Glyde et al . , 2018 ) was used . 40 nm of his-tagged holoenzyme was mixed with equal volumes of a dilution series of DNA in MST-binding buffer . MST experiments were performed using 70–100% LED power and 40–60% MST power with a wait time of 5 s , laser on time of 30 s and a back-diffusion time of 5 s . For all the binding experiments ( Ocr or σ with RNAP , or DNA with holoenzyme ) , MST data were analysed using Grafit 3 . 0 ( Erithacus Software ) and the data were fitted with a quadratic tight binding equation with the concentration of the constituent being titrated kept constant in the fitting process . The dissociation constants obtained are maximum values and the real values are likely to be rather smaller . This is due to the concentration of the protein being titrated being larger than the dissociation constant . In the competitive binding experiment with Ocr and σ70-RNAP holoenzyme , the data were fitted using the tight binding equation to determine the apparent dissociation constant . Each experiment was repeated at least three times . For structural studies using cryoEM , the His-tag of Ocr was cleaved and the purification procedure was as previously reported ( Sturrock et al . , 2001 ) . The complex was formed as described above . The RNAP-Ocr complex sample was concentrated to 0 . 6 mg/ml and 3 . 5 µl of the complex was applied to R2/2 holey carbon grids ( Quantifoil ) . The vitrification process was performed using a Vitrobot Mark IV ( FEI ) at 4°C and 95% humidity , blotted for 1 . 5 s with blotting force −6 . The grid was then flash frozen in liquid ethane and stored in the liquid nitrogen before data collection . The cryoEM data were collected at eBIC ( Diamond Light Source , UK ) on a Titan Krios using EPU ( FEI ) operated at 300 kV and a K2 summit direct electron detector ( Gatan ) . The data were collected with a defocus ( underfocus ) range between 1 . 5 µm to 3 . 5 µm . A total of 3543 micrographs were collected at pixel size of 1 . 06 Å/pixel and a dose of 50 e-/Å2 and each micrograph was fractioned into 41 frames ( 1 . 21 e-/Å2/frame ) . The procedure of data processing is summarised in Figure 2—figure supplement 1 . Frame alignment and dose weighting were carried out with MotionCor2 ( Zheng et al . , 2017 ) before estimating CTF parameters using Gctf ( Zhang , 2016 ) and particle picking using Gautomatch ( https://www . mrc-lmb . cam . ac . uk/kzhang/Gautomatch/ ) without a template . The picked particles were then extracted into boxes of 256 × 256 pixels . Initial 2D classification of the data was carried out in Cryosparc ( Punjani et al . , 2017 ) to remove junk particles due to ice contamination or other defects on the grids . Subsequent image processing was carried out in Relion 2 . 1 ( Scheres , 2012 ) . Briefly , the particles were separated using 3D classification . Three out of five classes were subsequently refined using the RNAP from the closed complex RPc ( EMD-3695 ) filtered to 60 Å as the initial reference map . The remaining two classes were discarded due to their lack of clear structural features , probably derived from particles that are of poor quality . After combining the remaining three classes and refinement , one more round of focused 3D classification by applying a mask was carried out to separate different complexes or conformations . To generate the mask , structural models of RNAP and Ocr were first fitted into the refined 3D reconstruction . Ocr and the surrounding RNAP clamp regions were then used to calculate a volume in Chimera . Two classes with clearly different conformations of RNAP and both with Ocr bound , were refined , polished and post-processed ( with masking and sharpening ) , resulting in the final reconstructions at 3 . 7 Å ( for the wide clamp RNAP-Ocr ) and 3 . 8 Å ( for the narrow clamp RNAP-Ocr ) based on the gold-standard Fourier shell correlation ( FSC ) at 0 . 143 criterion . The directional FSC analysis and histogram of directional resolution were performed using the 3D-FSC server ( 3dfsc . salk . edu ) ( Tan et al . , 2017 ) . The RNAP from RPo ( PDB code: 6GH5 ) and RPip ( PDB code: 6GH6 ) was used as an initial model for the model building of narrow clamp and wide clamp reconstructions , respectively . Briefly , the RNAP was first fitted into the RNAP-Ocr density map in Chimera ( Goddard et al . , 2007 ) . Subsequently the RNAP structure was subject to flexible fitting using MDFF ( Trabuco et al . , 2009 ) . The Ocr crystal structure ( PDB code: 1S7Z ) was manually fitted into the extra density of the RNAP-Ocr map in Coot ( Emsley et al . , 2010 ) . Jelly body refinement in Refmac ( Murshudov et al . , 2011 ) and real space refinement in Phenix ( Afonine et al . , 2012 ) were used to improve the model quality . The final statistics of the model are in Table 1 . The figures used for structure analysis and comparison were produced in Pymol ( The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System , Version 2 . 0 Schrödinger , LLC ) and UCSF Chimera ( Goddard et al . , 2007 ) . σ54 as well as σ70 were purified to homogeneity as described previously ( Nechaev and Severinov , 1999; Yang et al . , 2015 ) . All the reactions were carried out in the binding buffer ( 20 mM Tris-HCl pH8 . 0 , 200 mM KCl , 5 mM MgCl2 , 1 mM DTT , 5% glycerol ) at room temperature , for the sequentially addition of different components in each step , the incubation time was approximately15-20 min and all the gels used were polyacrylamide . To test the effects of Ocr on holoenzyme formation for both σ54 and σ70 , all the reactions were carried out in 20 µl at room temperature . The order of addition , final concentrations and molar ratio of different components are listed in corresponding figures . For each 20 µl reaction , 10 µl was taken out and loaded into one polyacrylamide gel ( 4 . 5% ) and the remaining 10 µl of each sample was loaded to another identical gel ( 4 . 5% ) and run in parallel for 160 mins at 80 volts at 4°C cold room . One gel was then stained with Coomassie blue and visualised , whilst the other gel was used for western blotting against the His-tagged protein of either σ54 or σ70 , following the standard western blotting protocol ( iBlot 2 Dry Blotting System , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . To test the effects of Ocr on the formation σ70 open complexes , DNA probes used in this study were all Cy3 labelled . For σ70 open complex experiments , one linear DNA used , the non-template DNA used was 5’- ACTTGACATCCCACCTCACGTATGCTATAATCCTACGAGTCTGACGCGG −3’ , and the template DNA used was 5’-CCGCGTCAGACTCGTAGGATTATAGCATACGTGAGGTGGGATGTCAAGT −3’ . All the other reactions were carried out at room temperature . The lacUV5 linear DNA used was the same as reported ( Cámara et al . , 2010 ) . The sequence of addition , the final concentration , molar ratios of different reactions are described in respective figures . All the gel ( 5% ) are run at 4 °C in cold rooms , with 100 volts for 75 mins . The results were analysed by visualizing and quantifying the fluorescent signals of Cy3 , attached to the DNA probes . All the experiments were repeated at least once and the results are consistent with each other . All reactions were performed in 10 µl final volumes containing: STA buffer ( Burrows et al . , 2010 ) , 100 nM holoenzyme ( 1:4 ratio of RNAP:σ54 ) , 20 nM promoter DNA probe ( for σ54 dependent transcription open complex formation , 4 mM dATP and 5 mM PspF1-275 were also present ) and incubated at room temperature . The sp RNA synthesis was initiated by adding 0 . 5 mM dinucleotide primer ( ApG , ApA , CpA or UpG ) , 0 . 2 mCi/ml [α-32P] GTP ( 3000 Ci/mmol ) or 0 . 2 mCi/ml [α-32P] UTP ( 3000 Ci/mmol ) . The reaction mixtures were quenched by addition of 4 µl of denaturing formamide loading buffer and run on a 20% denaturing gel and visualised using a Fuji FLA-5000 Phosphorimager . At least three independent experiments were carried out and values were within 5% of the relative % values measured . Growth of E . coli MG1655 cells not expressing Ocr ( WT/pBAD18cm ) and expressing Ocr ( WT/pBAD18cm[ocr] ) was monitored for 20 hr using a FLUOstar Omega plate reader ( BMG LABTECH ) . Starting cultures of 0 . 1 OD600 were inoculated in four different media , Luria-Bertani Broth ( LB ) with low ( 5 g/L ) and high ( 10 g/L ) salt concentration , nutrient broth ( Oxoid ) and modified M9 medium ( Teknova ) , at two different temperatures , 37°C and 25°C . Expression of Ocr was induced using two different concentration of arabinose , 0 . 02% ( w/v ) and 0 . 2% ( w/v ) . Gene expression levels of beta-galactosidase in E . coli MG1655 cells not expressing Ocr ( WT/pBAD18cm ) and expressing Ocr ( WT/pBAD18cm[ocr] ) were assessed using 0 . 002 mg/ml fluorescein di ( beta-D-galactopyranoside ) ( FDG; Sigma-Aldrich ) . FDG results in fluorescence signals , which are proportional to the enzymatic activities after being hydrolysed to fluorescein by beta-galactosidase . Beta-galactosidase expression was induced by 1 mM IPTG 5 hr post-inoculation . Following the beta-galactosidase assays , total bacterial RNA was extracted from E . coli MG1655 cells using the RNeasy Mini Kit ( Qiagen ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Residual DNA was digested by DNase I ( Promega ) and cDNA synthesis was performed using 500 ng of RNA and the SuperScript IV reverse transcriptase ( Invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Quantitation of the beta-galactosidase mRNA levels was performed using the specific oligonucleotide primers 5’-ATG GGT AAC AGT CTT GGC GG-3’ and 5’-GGC GTA TCG CCA AAA TCA CC-3’ , the Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix ( Applied Biosystems ) and the relative standard curve quantitation method as implemented by the OneStep Plus Real-Time qPCR System ( Applied Biosystems ) ."}

We have developed a novel knock-in mouse model harboring heterozygous ( Tubb4aD249N/+ ) and the homozygous ( Tubb4aD249N/D249N ) mutation that recapitulate the progressive motor dysfunction with tremor , dystonia and ataxia seen in H-ABC .

Additionally , a significant loss occurs in the cerebellar granular neurons and striatal neurons in Tubb4aD249N/D249N mice . In vitro studies show decreased survival and dysfunction in microtubule dynamics in neurons from Tubb4aD249N/D249N mice . Thus Tubb4aD249N/D249N mice demonstrate the complex cellular physiology of H-ABC , likely due to independent effects on oligodendrocytes , striatal neurons , and cerebellar granule cells in the context of altered microtubule dynamics , with profound neurodevelopmental deficits .", "plain language summary": "Inside human and other animal cells , filaments known as microtubules help support the shape of the cell and move proteins to where they need to be . Defects in microtubules may lead to disease . For example , genetic mutations affecting a microtubule component called TUBB4A cause a rare brain disease in humans known as H-ABC . Individuals with H-ABC display many symptoms including abnormal walking , speech defects , impaired swallowing , and several cognitive defects . Abnormalities in several areas of the brain , including the cerebellum and striatum contribute to these defects . . In these structures , the neurons that carry messages around the brain and their supporting cells , known as oligodendrocytes , die , which causes these parts of the brain to gradually waste away . At this time , there are no therapies available to treat H-ABC . Furthermore , research into the disease has been hampered by the lack of a suitable “model” in mice or other laboratory animals . To address this issue , Sase , Almad et al . generated mice carrying a mutation in a gene which codes for the mouse equivalent of the human protein TUBB4A . Experiments showed that the mutant mice had similar physical symptoms to humans with H-ABC , including an abnormal walking gait , poor coordination and involuntary movements such as twitching and reduced reflexes . H-ABC mice had smaller cerebellums than normal mice , which was consistent with the wasting away of the cerebellum observed in individuals with H-ABC . The mice also lost neurons in the striatum and cerebellum , and oligodendrocytes in the brain and spinal cord . Furthermore , the mutant TUBB4A protein affected the behavior and formation of microtubules in H-ABC mice . The findings of Sase , Almad et al . provide the first mouse model that shares many features of H-ABC disease in humans . This model provides a useful tool to study the disease and develop potential new therapies .", "article": "1 Introduction Hypomyelination with Atrophy of Basal Ganglia and Cerebellum ( H-ABC ) is a leukodystrophy caused by sporadic , typically de novo , heterozygous mutations in the TUBB4A gene ( Simons et al . , 2013 ) . This gene encodes the tubulin beta 4A protein , which heterodimerizes with α−tubulin to form subunits that assemble into microtubules . Monoallelic mutations in TUBB4A result in a spectrum of neurologic disorders ranging from an early onset leukoencephalopathy to adult-onset Dystonia type 4 ( DYT4; Whispering Dysphonia ) . H-ABC falls within this spectrum , presenting in the toddler years , typically with dystonia ( Hersheson et al . , 2013 ) , progressive gait impairment , speech and cognitive deficits , as well as characteristic neuroimaging features - hypomyelination and atrophy of the caudate and putamen along with cerebellar atrophy ( van der Knaap et al . , 2007 ) . On human pathological specimens , dorsal striatal areas and the granular layer of the cerebellum exhibit neuronal loss with axonal swelling and diffuse paucity of myelin ( Curiel et al . , 2017; Simons et al . , 2013 ) . About 65% of published cases with TUBB4A mutations have H-ABC; the heterozygous mutation p . Asp249Asn ( TUBB4AD249N/+ ) is the most common mutation ( 24 . 1% of overall mutations in a cohort of 166 individuals- personal communication B . Charsar ) amongst all forms of TUBB4A associated leukodystrophy , and is particularly represented in individuals with a H-ABC phenotype ( Blumkin et al . , 2014; Ferreira et al . , 2014; Miyatake et al . , 2014; Pizzino et al . , 2014; Purnell et al . , 2014 ) . H-ABC is currently considered an intermediary phenotype , between severely affected early infantile variants and juvenile-adult mild variants ( Nahhas N et al . , 2016 ) . Although the expression pattern and associated disease phenotypes implicate a functional role of tubulin beta 4A protein in both neurons and oligodendrocytes , little is known about the pathologic mechanisms of TUBB4A mutations . TUBB4A is highly expressed in the central nervous system ( CNS ) , particularly in the cerebellum and white matter tracts of the brain , with more moderate expression in the striatum ( Hersheson et al . , 2013 ) , reflecting disease involvement in H-ABC . At a cellular level , TUBB4A is primarily localized to neurons and oligodendrocytes ( OLs ) , with highest expression in mature myelinating OLs ( Zhang et al . , 2014 ) . Our group has reported the effects of expressing a range of TUBB4A mutations using an OL cell line as well as mouse cerebellar neurons ( Curiel et al . , 2017 ) . Over-expression of the TUBB4AD249N mutation in an OL cell line resulted in decreased myelin gene expression and fewer processes compared to expression of wild type TUBB4A ( TUBB4AWT ) ( Curiel et al . , 2017 ) . Similarly , in cerebellar neurons , TUBB4AD249N over-expression resulted in shorter axons , fewer dendrites , and decreased dendritic branching compared to TUBB4AWT ( Curiel et al . , 2017 ) . Other TUBB4A mutations highlighted phenotypic abnormalities specifically only in neurons and/or OL cell lines , suggesting mutation-specific effects , corresponding to variable clinical phenotypes ( Curiel et al . , 2017 ) . This work highlights the importance of using models with mutations naturally occurring in humans . A spontaneously occurring rat model , the taiep rat , with a homozygous p . Ala302Thr Tubb4a mutation , has been reported with only a hypomyelinating phenotype in the brain , optic nerves and certain tracts of the spinal cord but no neuronal pathology ( Duncan et al . , 2017 ) . The taiep specific mutation has not been reported in humans but is consistent with our cellular data showing variable cellular phenotypes for different mutations . An interesting feature observed in the taiep was accumulation of microtubules , particularly in the OLs , with subsequent demyelination ( Duncan et al . , 2017 ) . Currently , there are no published animal models for the TUBB4AD249N mutation specifically associated with H-ABC; which is key for understanding the pathogenesis and developing therapeutic options for individuals who harbor this mutation . Thus , we have developed a knock-in Tubb4aD249N/D249N mouse as a model of H-ABC , recapitulating features of the human disease including dystonia , loss of motor function , and gait abnormalities . The histopathological features of the mouse model include both loss of neurons in striatum and cerebellum and hypomyelination in the brain and spinal cord , as observed in patients ( Curiel et al . , 2017 ) . We have also explored the functional consequence of mutant tubulin on microtubule polymerization and the cell-autonomous role of Tubb4a mutation in neurons and OLs of the Tubb4aD249N/D249N mice . 2 Results Heterozygous mutation p . Asp249Asn ( Tubb4aD249N/+ ) mice were generated using CRISPR-Cas-9 technology by substituting p . Asp249Asn ( c . 745G > A ) mutation in exon 4 of the Tubb4a gene . Known off-target effects include one synonymous mutation in cis at p . Lys244Lys ( c . 732C > A ) with the pathogenic variant at p . Asp249Asn ( variant at c . 745G > A ) . Tubb4aD249N/+ mice were bred to obtain a homozygous Tubb4aD249N/D249N mouse colony ( Figure 1A ) . Homozygous mice were studied in parallel with Tubb4aD249N/+ mice , because in a rat model of Tubb4a mutation ( Li et al . , 2003 ) , the homozygous animals develop phenotypic manifestations earlier than heterozygous animals . In WT mice , Tubb4a gene expression is highest in the cerebellum , spinal cord and striatum ( compared to other CNS areas ) , which are also typically affected brain regions in H-ABC individuals . However , Tubb4a gene expression in WT , Tubb4aD249N/+and Tubb4aD249N/D249N mice are similar in these brain areas ( Figure 1B ) , indicating there is no transcriptional change in the face of the mutation . The homozygous Tubb4aD249N/D249N mutant mice appear normal compared to WT and heterozygous Tubb4aD249N/+ littermates until ~post natal ( P ) day P8 . However , by ~P9 , Tubb4aD249N/D249N mice display tremor ( Figure 1—videos 1 and 2 ) , which progressively worsens with age ( Figure 1—videos 3 and 4 ) until mice become severely ataxic and dystonic ( ~P21 ) . Additionally , Tubb4aD249N/D249N mice show gradual weight reduction from P35-37 compared to Tubb4aD249N/+ and WT mice ( p<0 . 001 , Figure 1D ) . Motor skills were assessed by measuring ambulation , hanging grip strength , rotarod testing and righting reflexes over time . Tubb4aD249N/D249N mice exhibit developmental delay with persistent asymmetric limb movement and crawling gait at P10 relative to ambulation in WT controls ( p<0 . 05 , see Table 1 , Figure 1E–F ) . While Tubb4aD249N/D249N mice achieve walking by P14 , they display tremor , ataxia and abnormal gait . Ambulatory angle is consistently wider in Tubb4aD249N/D249N mice from P14 to P35 ( p<0 . 001 , Figure 1G–H ) suggesting gait instability . Additionally , Tubb4aD249N/D249N mice demonstrate early deficits in hanging grip strength test , where compared to WT mice , they fall at a lesser angle ( p<0 . 001 , Figure 1I–J ) . Rotarod performance further shows a shorter latency to fall in Tubb4aD249N/D249N mice on an accelerating rotarod , with worsening over time ( p<0 . 001 , Figure 1K , Figure 1—video 5 ) . By ~P35-P40 , Tubb4aD249N/D249N mice are unable to feed themselves , with a decreased righting reflex ( p<0 . 001 , Figure 1L ) . At this time , mice reach a compassionate end-point ( survival curve , p<0 . 001 , Figure 1M–N ) and are considered ‘end-stage’ . Heterozygous Tubb4aD249N/+ mice transition well from crawling to ambulation and walk with a normal gait reminiscent of WT mice . Rotarod on Tubb4aD249N/+ mice at 9 months and 1 year of age demonstrates no motor or gait abnormalities even at later timepoints ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1A ) . Further , Tubb4aD249N/+ mice display similar survival compared to their WT littermates and die because of advanced age ( Kaplan-Meier survival curve , Figure 1—figure supplement 1B ) . Myelination in mice starts at birth in the brainstem and spinal cord and has a nearly adult pattern by P21 ( Baumann and Pham-Dinh , 2001 ) . Profound myelination deficits are observed in Tubb4aD249N/D249N mice , relative to their WT littermates , in both corpus callosum and cerebellum at P14 and P21 ( Eri-C staining in Figure 2D and F and Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and Figure 2—figure supplement 2 ) with further loss of myelination by end-stage ( ~P35-P40 ) ( p<0 . 001 , Figure 2C–F ) . Based on Eri-C staining , myelination also decreases in Tubb4aD249N/+ mice at 1 year of age relative to WT littermates ( p<0 . 001 , Figure 2G–H ) . The myelin proteins , PLP and MBP , measured by immunostaining , are also decreased in Tubb4aD249N/D249N mice relative to Tubb4aD249N/+ and WT mice ( Figure 2W and Figure 2—figure supplement 2 , p<0 . 001 ) , with a significant difference at P21 and end-stage ( Figure 2L , P , T and X ) . This decrease in PLP and MBP protein is further confirmed with immunoblotting in forebrain ( Figure 2M–N and U–V ) and cerebellum ( Figure 2Q–R and Y–Z ) of Tubb4aD249N/D249N mice at P21 ( p<0 . 05 ) and end-stage ( p<0 . 001 ) . Tubb4aD249N/+ mice have comparable MBP and PLP immunoreactivity as WT mice at P14 , P21 ( Figure 2—figure supplements 1 and 2 ) , and ~P35-P40 ( Figure 2 ) . However , by 1 year , their myelin protein levels significantly diminish in the corpus callosum compared to WT mice ( p<0 . 05 , PLP: Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–D; p<0 . 05 , Figure 2I–J ) . To understand the developmental and degenerative abnormalities of myelin formation in Tubb4aD249N/+ and Tubb4aD249N/D249N mice , oligodendrocytes ( OLs ) were assessed using ASPA stain in the corpus callosum at P14 , P21 and end-stage ( Figure 3C ) . A dramatic decline occurs in the number of OLs in the Tubb4aD249N/D249N mice relative to their WT and Tubb4aD249N/+ littermates at all timepoints ( p<0 . 001 , Figure 3D , Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–B ) . However , upon examining the cells double-labeled with CC1 ( mature OL marker ) and cleaved caspase 3 ( cell death marker ) ; no cell death is detected at end-stage ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2A ) , potentially ruling out apoptosis mediated OL death . To test , if OL numbers are in fact altered due to an effect on the progenitor pool , the total number of NG2 cells as well as NG2+ Cleaved Caspase 3+ cells were studied for cell death . While the total number of NG2 cells are unchanged ( Figure 3E–F ) , a significant number of NG2 cells undergo apoptosis in Tubb4aD249N/D249N mice compared to WT and Tubb4aD249N/+ mice at P14 , P21 and end-stage ( p<0 . 01 , p<0 . 001 , Figure 3G–H and Figure 3—figure supplement 2B–C ) . Interestingly , in spite of the ongoing loss , the total number of NG2 and Olig2 populations are stable ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1C–E ) . Loss or damage to OPCs can result in a proliferative response ( Hughes et al . , 2013 ) , hence the number of dividing NG2 cells was next assessed at P14 , P21 and end-stage timepoints . A significant increase is detected in NG2+ cells co-labeled with Ki-67 ( proliferation marker ) in Tubb4aD249N/D249N mice at all timepoints compared to Tubb4aD249N/+ and WT mice ( p<0 . 05 , p<0 . 01; Figure 3I–J , Figure 3—figure supplement 2D–E ) , possibly contributing to the steady number of NG2+ and Olig2+ cells . In summary , OPCs undergo cell death and are being replaced in the Tubb4aD249N/D249N mice , though possible defects in OPC differentiation results in fewer mature OLs . Loss of myelination was examined in epoxy sections of optic nerves from Tubb4aD249N/D249N mice compared to WT and Tubb4aD249N/+ mice , at P21 ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) and end-stage ( data not shown ) . Electron microscopy further confirms that end-stage Tubb4aD249N/D249N optic nerves ( n = 3 ) contain mostly unmyelinated axons and/or axons with myelin sheaths that are inappropriately thin for their axonal caliber ( Figure 4A–C and A’-C’ ) . In Tubb4aD249N/+ spinal cords , myelin sheaths are also noticeably thinner than in WT littermates as seen in the epoxy ( Figure 4K–O ) and EM sections ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2 ) . Along with dramatically reduced numbers of normally myelinated axons , Tubb4aD249N/D249N optic nerves exhibit microglia and/or macrophages containing myelin debris and lipid droplets ( Figure 4D–D’ ) , dying OLs ( Figure 4E ) as well as vacuoles ( Figure 4G ) . As seen in taiep rats , we find enlarged astrocytic processes ( ‘astrogliosis’ ) , axons with abnormal accumulations of lysosomes , degenerating unmyelinated and/or myelinated axons , but not bundles of microtubules in OLs ( Duncan et al . , 2017; Duncan et al . , 1992; O'Connor et al . , 2000; Roncagliolo et al . , 2006; Wilkins et al . , 2010 ) . Many OLs are partially surrounded by unmyelinated axons , some of which are variably surrounded by cytoplasmic invaginations , reminiscent of non-myelinating Schwann cells in peripheral nerves ( Figure 4F ) . Tubb4aD249N/+ optic nerves , in contrast , look similar to WT optic nerves except for more conspicuous astrocytic processes ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) . These findings are even more striking in Tubb4aD249N/D249N spinal cord at end-stage , where most large axons of the ventral funiculus are unmyelinated with conspicuous vacuoles , along with microglia and/or macrophages comprising of myelin debris , lipid droplets , and other unidentified material ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2 ) . Compared to WT mice , the g-ratio , a measure of myelin thickness , is significantly higher in optic nerves of Tubb4aD249N/D249N and Tubb4aD249N/+ mice ( Figure 4H , p<0 . 001 ) . The axon caliber in optic nerves is significantly decreased in Tubb4aD249N/D249N mice versus WT mice at end-stage ( Figure 4I , p<0 . 05 ) . Further , plotting g-ratio as a function of axon diameter ( Figure 4J ) demonstrates that intact axons of all calibers in optic nerves have relatively thinner myelin sheaths in Tubb4aD249N/+ and Tubb4aD249N/D249N mice . The analysis of the percentage of myelination in the optic nerve reveals that ~65% of the axons are unmyelinated ( Figure 4K , p<0 . 001 ) and ~30% of axons are thinly dysmyelinated axons in the Tubb4aD249N/D249N ( Figure 4K , p<0 . 01 ) compared to ~3% unmyelinated and 13% thinly dysmyelinated axons in WT mice . While about ~56% of axons are normally myelinated in the Tubb4aD249N/+ mice ( Figure 4K , p<0 . 001 ) , ~5% of axons are unmyelinated and about ~39% thinly myelinated axons ( Figure 4K , p<0 . 001 ) . Similar to optic nerves , compared to WT mice , the g-ratio in spinal cords of Tubb4aD249N/D249N and in Tubb4aD249N/+ mice are also significantly different ( Figure 4L–N and O , p<0 . 001 ) . Further , plotting g-ratio as a function of axon diameter demonstrates that all axons in spinal cord have relatively thinner myelin sheaths in Tubb4aD249N/+ and Tubb4aD249N/D249N mice ( Figure 4P ) . The survival of neurons was examined in the cerebellum and striatum of WT , Tubb4aD249N/+ and Tubb4aD249N/D249N mice with NeuN and Nissl’s stain across developmental time points ( Figure 5A ) . Nissl’s stain on cerebellar sections of Tubb4aD249N/D249N mice reveals a severe progressive loss of the granular neuron layer from P21 to end-stage and a remarkable decrease in cerebellar volume ( Figure 5B–C ) . Tubb4aD249N/D249N mice display comparable number of granular neurons at P14 compared to WT mice ( Figure 5E and Figure 5—figure supplement 1A ) , however , a dramatic and progressive granular neuron loss is observed at P21 and end-stage ( p<0 . 001 , Figure 5D–E ) . In addition , a significant increase in the number of Cleaved Caspase 3 positive cells co-localized with NeuN is observed at P21 and end-stage , indicating cellular apoptosis ( p<0 . 001 , Figure 5F–G ) . The loss of other neuronal populations in the cerebellum , such as Purkinje neurons stained with calbindin , do not display any change in the different groups of mice ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1D–E ) . In the striatum , NeuN counts for Tubb4aD249N/+ and Tubb4aD249N/D249N are comparable to WT mice at P14 and P21 time points ( Figure 5J and Figure 5—figure supplement 1B ) . But at end-stage , Tubb4aD249N/D249N mice demonstrate a significant loss of striatal neurons compared to WT mice ( p<0 . 01 , Figure 5I–J ) . In order to explore the effect of Tubb4a mutations in OLs and neurons , independent of their in-situ environment , we studied in vitro cultures derived from WT , Tubb4aD249N/+ , and Tubb4aD249N/D249N mice . OPCs were examined using A2B5 stain and a significant decrease is observed in the number of A2B5+ cells isolated from Tubb4aD249N/+ and Tubb4aD249N/D249N mice compared to control WT mice ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1A–D; p<0 . 01 ) . Next , to assess if the decrease in OPCs is due to proliferation or cell death , A2B5 cells were co-labeled with Ki-67 or Caspase3 respectively . A significant decrease was noted in the number of A2B5+ Ki-67+ proliferating OPCs in Tubb4aD249N ( p<0 . 05 ) and Tubb4aD249N/D249N ( p<0 . 01 ) group compared to the WT mice ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1A–C , Figure 6—figure supplement 1E ) . No changes were observed in the number of A2B5+ Caspase3+ cells between the three groups ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1F ) . The OPCs were then differentiated towards an OL fate and were examined for PLP , a mature OL marker co-localized with Olig2 , a pan OL lineage marker . A significant decrease in the number of PLP+ OLs is observed ( Figure 6A–C ) in Tubb4aD249N/+ mice ( p<0 . 05 ) and Tubb4aD249N/D249N mice ( p<0 . 01 ) compared to mature OLs derived from WT mice ( Figure 6E ) . However , the total number of Olig2+ cells are similar in all the groups ( Figure 6D ) , resulting in a significant reduction in the proportion of mature OLs from the total cells committed to the OL lineage ( PLP+/Olig2 cells , Figure 6F ) in Tubb4aD249N/+ ( p<0 . 01 ) and Tubb4aD249N/D249N mice ( p<0 . 01 ) compared to WT mice . These results overall reflect similar changes in OL development as seen in vivo in the mouse tissues and support a cell-autonomous contribution of Tubb4aD249N/+ mutation in the development of OL lineage cells . We also examined cortical neurons using in vitro cultures derived from WT , Tubb4aD249N/+ and Tubb4aD249N/D249N mice . We analyzed survival based on the number of neurons labeled with Tuj1 and MAP2 stains at one-week post-plating . Tubb4aD249N/D249N neurons display a significant decrease in survival relative to WT neurons ( Figure 6G–I , p<0 . 01 ) and Tubb4aD249N/+ neurons . We also assessed whether Tubb4aD249N affects neuronal morphology , by measuring axonal outgrowth and total dendritic length . Axon length is shorter in Tubb4aD249N/+ neurons ( Figure 6J ) and significantly shorter in Tubb4aD249N/D249N neurons than WT neurite length ( p<0 . 05 ) . Total dendritic length is not significantly altered across genotypes ( Figure 6K ) , although Tubb4aD249N/D249N neurons shows a trend for shorter dendritic arbors . Overall , H-ABC associated TubbaD249N mutation affects neuronal development , particularly axonal elongation . We next investigated whether Tubb4a mutation affects microtubules dynamics in the distal axons of cortical neurons expressing mCherry-tagged EB3 , a protein that forms comet-like structures at the growing plus-ends of microtubules from WT , Tubb4aD249N/+ and Tubb4aD249N/D249N mice ( Figure 7A; Stepanova et al . , 2003 ) . The average number of EB3 comets is not significantly different in neurons from WT , Tubb4aD249N/+ , or Tubb4aD249N/D249N mice ( Figure 7B ) . However , we noted that the Tubb4aD249N/D249N data shows a greater variance ( Browne-Forsythe test for equality of variances revealed a significant difference among the conditions , p<0 . 05 ) compared to WT and Tubb4aD249N/+ neurons . Histogram analysis reveals two distinct populations within the Tubb4aD249N/D249N dataset , with some neurons displaying a lower density of EB3-comets and others a higher density of comets than seen in neurons from either the WT or heterozygous mice ( Figure 7C ) . EB3 comet run-time ( Figure 7D ) in Tubb4aD249N/D249N neurons is significantly shorter ( p<0 . 001 ) compared to WT neurons and Tubb4aD249N/+ neurons . Similarly , EB3 comet run-length in Tubb4aD249N/D249N and Tubb4aD249N/+ neurons is significantly shorter than in WT neurons ( p<0 . 001 , Figure 7E ) . In contrast , EB3 comet velocity is similar across all genotypes ( Figure 7—figure supplement 1 ) , indicating that microtubule growth rates were not affected . 3 Discussion TUBB4A mutations were identified in H-ABC affected individuals in 2013 ( Simons et al . , 2013 ) , and additional mutations were later associated with a spectrum of hypomyelinating conditions ( Hamilton et al . , 2014; Nahhas N et al . , 2016 ) . The p . Asp249Asn ( D249N ) variant has been closely tied to the classic features of H-ABC , including the characteristic triad of hypomyelination with striatal and cerebellar atrophy . Although the naturally occurring taeip rat model harbors a Tubb4a mutation , the p . Ala302Thr mutation has not previously been seen in affected human individuals; the model lacks cerebellar and striatal atrophy ( Duncan et al . , 2017; Li et al . , 2003 ) and is more consistent with those individuals manifesting isolated hypomyelination ( Pizzino et al . , 2014 ) . In this study , we sought to fully explore H-ABC in a novel CRISPR-Cas9 transgenic model of the classic p . Asp249Asn ( D249N ) mutation , hoping to provide greater understanding of the diverse cellular phenotypes affected in the human disease . Tubb4a mutations in our model results in a severe myelin pathology , consistent with hypomyelination and progressive demyelination over time . Profound hypomyelination may contribute to early onset tremor in Tubb4aD249N/D249N mice , similar to what is seen in Shiverer ( Biddle et al . , 1973 ) , Shimild ( Readhead and Hood , 1990 ) and Jimpy mice ( Nave et al . , 1986 ) . Tubb4a is highly expressed in mature OLs ( Zhang et al . , 2014 ) , which may contribute to the significant glia phenotype in this mouse . The number of OPCs appears to be preserved in vivo in Tubb4aD249N/D249N mice , although co-staining of NG2 ( OPC marker ) with caspase indicates increased cell death in early OL lineage cells of Tubb4aD249N/D249N mice . A preserved overall number of NG2 and Olig2+ cells suggests that the death of OPCs may result in increased proliferation in vivo , supported by co-staining of NG2 with Ki-67 . It has previously been shown that OPCs are dynamic cells and maintain their homeostatic behavior since NG2 cells abolished by differentiation or death are quickly restored through proliferation of the nearest OPCs ( Hughes et al . , 2013 ) . OPCs isolated from Tubb4aD249N/+ and Tubb4aD249N/D249N mice showed no changes in cell death markers but displayed defects in proliferation with fewer A2B5+ Ki-67+ cells compared to control WT control mice . Thus in vitro changes reflect a cell-autonomous effect resulting in decreased proliferation with no change in cell death . Conversely , in vivo dynamics of OPCs is complex as the increase in OPC proliferation occurs in the context of cell death , which could possibly be due to cross-talk with other cells such as neurons ( Nagy et al . , 2017 ) and influence of the milieu , as has been seen in other neurodegenerative disorders ( Fernandez-Castaneda and Gaultier , 2016; Kang et al . , 2013; Lee et al . , 2019; McTigue and Tripathi , 2008; Tripathi and McTigue , 2007 ) . Ultimately , both in vitro and in vivo studies show significant decrease in the number of mature OLs in Tubb4aD249N/D249N mice as opposed to WT control mice . Since OLs express a greater degree of Tubb4a , it is possible a proportion of mature OLs die , not captured by the apoptotic marker caspase in vivo or die by a non-apoptotic mechanism . Thus , both cell death and inefficient differentiation may account for severe deficits seen in formation of mature OLs in Tubb4aD249N/D249N mice . Pathology does not appear to be restricted to the OL lineage in H-ABC , however . Tubb4aD249N/D249N mice show evidence of severe loss of cerebellar granular neurons at P21 and more limited striatal neuron degeneration after ~P37 . The milder defects seen in striatal neurons may be related to the variable expression of Tubb4a , that is relatively higher in cerebellum than striatum ( Figure 1B; Hersheson et al . , 2013 ) . We also studied cortical neurons in culture from Tubb4aD249N/+ and Tubb4aD249N/D249N mice , demonstrating decreased survival and stunted axonal and dendritic length , although no obvious cortical defect is identified in vivo . Neuronal loss in the striatum and cerebellar granule layer is consistent with reported neuropathology in individuals affected by H-ABC ( Pizzino et al . , 2014; van der Knaap et al . , 2002 ) and may underlie the progressive gait abnormalities , ataxia , and motor dysfunction seen in both this mouse model and affected individuals . MTs are integral to neuronal and OL development , contributing to their structure , including arborization , polarity , growth cone dynamics; as well as function such as axonal transport and intracellular transport of key myelin proteins through efficient MT polymerization ( Clark et al . , 2016 ) . A number of mutations in α-tubulin and β-tubulin are attributed to neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s disease ( Cartelli et al . , 2010 ) and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis ( Fanara et al . , 2007 ) due to altered MT dynamics resulting in impaired axonal transport crucial for active cargo transport . Previous in vitro reports ( Curiel et al . , 2017; Vulinovic et al . , 2018 ) suggest that TUBB4AD249N/+ causes alterations in tubulin dynamics . In current studies , while there is no change in microtubule assembly rates in functional studies in Tubb4aD249N/+ and Tubb4aD249N/D249N neurons , a potential increase occurs in the frequency of pausing at the growing microtubule ends . Our data also suggests that there may be alterations in microtubule organization in axons , given the increased variance in EB3-comet density along the axons of Tubb4aD249N/D249N neurons . Alterations in MT dynamics or organization in Tubb4aD249N/D249N neurons may hamper the transport of cargo required for axon elongation and dendritic branching . Additionally , given the complexity of OL processes and myelin sheath development , it can be foreseen that inefficient delivery of cargo along MTs also contributes to the decreased maturation and complexity of Tubb4aD249N/D249N OLs . Notably , the taeip rat displays an accumulation of microtubules in OLs , unmyelinated axons , and astrogliosis along with perinuclear localization of RNA for PLP , MAG and MBP myelin genes , which was attributed to altered activity of the motor protein dynein for MBP trafficking in mutated OLs ( Duncan et al . , 2017; O'Connor et al . , 2000; Song et al . , 2003; Wilkins et al . , 2010 ) . Our EM studies in Tubb4aD249N/D249N mice show unmyelinated or abnormally thin myelinated axons , astrogliosis , axons with abnormal accumulation of lysosomes , microglia , and/or macrophages containing myelin debris , and lipid droplets reminiscent of deficits seen in taiep rats . However , the remarkable microtubule accumulation demonstrated in the taiep rat ( Duncan et al . , 2017 ) is not seen in our Tubb4aD249N/D249N mice . Despite no microtubule accumulation , it is noteworthy that the Tubb4aD249N/D249N mutation appears to significantly affect microtubule dynamics in our model . This may be the basis for the cell-autonomous effects of Tubb4a mutations , leading to decreased OL maturation , impaired axonal growth and reduced neuronal survival . The exact mechanism by which Tubb4aD249N/+ mutation impacts microtubule function , myelination , and neuronal function remains unknown and needs to be further explored . An important limitation of this study is the use of mice with both heterozygous and homozygous mutations , when in humans the inheritance pattern of H-ABC is sporadic with heterozygous mutations causing disease . While both Tubb4aD249N/D249N and heterozygous Tubb4aD249N/+ mice demonstrate severe hypomyelination followed by additional myelin loss; only the homozygous Tubb4aD249N/D249N mice show early deficits in gait and motor skills , consistent with ataxia and tremor seen in H-ABC affected individuals . One potential explanation for this species-specific difference is dosage sensitivity , resulting in a dissimilar penetrance of phenotypes . This has been reported for the taiep rat model ( Li et al . , 2003 ) ; in addition , there are several other reported genes such as GATA3 ( Lim et al . , 2000 ) , TBX1 ( Jerome and Papaioannou , 2001 ) , GLI3 ( Böse et al . , 2002 ) where , heterozygous mutations are present in humans but homozygous mice have similar phenotypic expression to the human disease . The presence of disease in both heterozygous and homozygous animals could be due to mutations causing either loss or gain of function . However , our previous in vitro work and a study in human SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing mutant TUBB4A ( Curiel et al . , 2017; Vulinovic et al . , 2018 ) suggests a mechanism for toxic gain of function . This is further supported by existing Tubb4a knock out ( KO ) mouse models . Tubb4a KO mice with LacZ expression ( Skarnes et al . , 2011 ) are available at the knock-out mouse project repository ( http://www . mousephenotype . org/data/genes/MGI:107848#section-associations ) . Homozygous Tubb4a KO mice show normal embryonic development and growth relative to WT mice . Phenotypic lac Z expression data shows that the nervous system appears normal with no discernible cerebellar neuron loss . Together this body of evidence suggests a mechanism of dominant toxic gain of function and while presence of WT Tubb4a might not be essential for brain development and function , mutations may later result in neuronal and oligodendrocyte deficits . As various TUBB4A mutations have been reported ( Lu et al . , 2017; Pizzino et al . , 2014; Tonduti et al . , 2016 ) , it is becoming recognized that mutation specific cellular effects , with independent involvement of the striatum , myelinating cells , and cerebellum , may be responsible for the wide phenotypic variability seen in this condition ( Curiel et al . , 2017; Pizzino et al . , 2014 ) . Tubb4aD249N/D249N mice are the first model to demonstrate both neuronal and oligodendroglial defects , and replicate the behavioral and neurodegenerative features of classical H-ABC disease . These data support a pathogenic pathway in which altered microtubules are critical drivers of disease pathogenesis across diverse cellular populations . Tubb4aD249N/D249N mice provide a key tool to explore the molecular mechanisms of this complex disease and test the efficacy of therapeutic strategies . 4 Materials and methods Heterozygous Tubb4aD249N/+ mice were generated using CRISPR-Cas9 technology by inserting the c . 745G > A ( p . Asp249Asn ) mutation in exon 4 of the mouse Tubb4a gene . Methodologies are available in Appendix 1 and gRNA sequences is listed in the key resources table . Sequencing of other areas with high homology to the target sequence was performed to assess that only variants in the Tubb4a gene were retained in the final mouse line . Control ( WT ) mice were generated from breeding pairs of heterozygous Tubb4aD249N/+ mice to further provide reassurance of limited of target effects in other homologous genes . We established one founder line of Tubb4aD249N/+ mice , which were bred to produce wild type ( WT ) , Tubb4aD249N/+ , and Tubb4aD249N/D249N mice . The animals were genotyped at all experimental steps and were maintained under a 12 hr ( h ) light:12 hr dark cycle in a clean facility and given free access to food and water . The methods and study protocols were approved in full by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Children’s hospital of Philadelphia and conformed with the revised National Institutes of Health Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare Policy . Ambulatory angle , ambulation , hanging grip strength , righting reflex ( Feather-Schussler and Ferguson , 2016 ) , and rotarod ( Shiotsuki et al . , 2010 ) were assessed at defined developmental intervals ( Figure 1C ) . Detailed methods are provided in SI Methods . A cohort of at least 10 animals per genotype were included for the behavioral tests . To determine the relative expression of Tubb4a in brain , fresh brain areas as cerebellum , cortex , hippocampus , hypothalamus , pre-frontal cortex , striatum and spinal cord were dissected at end-stage ( ~P35-P40 ) and snap frozen . RNA extraction , C-DNA and qPCR details are provided in Appendix 1 . Mice were anesthetized based on weight with ketamine and xylazine and transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) after an initial flush with 1X PBS . Brains were collected and post-fixed with 4% PFA in 1X PBS overnight , infiltrated in 30% sucrose in 1X PBS , embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound and sectioned either as coronal or sagittal ( 50 μm ) sections on a cryostat microtome ( CM 3050 s , Leica biosystems , USA ) . Myelin quantification was performed by Eriochrome Cynanine ( Eri-C ) stain , PLP and MBP in the densely myelinated region- corpus callosum ( Baxi et al . , 2017 ) and cerebellum . Eriochrome Cynanine ( Eri-C ) and neurofilament staining was according to previously published protocols ( Sahinkaya et al . , 2014 ) ( Appendix 1 ) . For Nissl staining , frozen sections were stained with 0 . 1% cresyl violet for 15 min , rinsed with PBS , dehydrated with graded alcohols ( from 70–100% ) , followed by xylene , and mounted with Permount . For immunofluorescence staining , free floating sections were blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin and 0 . 1% Triton X-100 for 1 hr at room temperature and then sequentially incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C and the fluorescent secondary antibodies for 1 hr at room temperature . Primary antibodies are listed in the Key Resource Table above . AlexaFluor-488 or AlexaFluor-647 conjugated secondary antibodies against rabbit , mouse , or rat ( 1:1000; Invitrogen ) were used , and nuclei were counterstained with DAPI . Image acquisition and image quantification details are provided in the SI . To determine the relative levels of key myelin proteins in the affected regions of our mouse model and corresponding to areas of disease in H-ABC , immunoblotting was performed on cerebellum and forebrain at post-natal ( P ) 14 , P21 , and end-stage ( ~P35-P40 ) . The details of immunoblotting are explained in SI . A separate cohort of mice were perfused transcardially with 0 . 9% saline followed by 2% PFA and 2% glutaraldehyde in 0 . 1M phosphate buffer ( PB; pH 7 . 4 ) at end-stage ( ~day 35 ) ( n = 3/group ) ( Lancaster et al . , 2018 ) . The optic nerve and cervical spinal cord were examined as they are highly myelinated and routinely used for studying myelin ultrastructure ( Lancaster et al . , 2018 ) . The optic nerve and cervical spinal cord were dissected , post-fixed for 24 hr , rinsed in 0 . 1M PB , transferred to 2% OsO4 in 0 . 1M PB for 1 hr , then processed for embedding in Epon ( Lancaster et al . , 2018 ) . Semi-thin sections were cut , stained with alkaline toluidine blue , and visualized using a light microscope ( Lecia DMR ) interactive software ( Leica Application Suite ) . Ultra-thin sections ( 70 nm ) were cut , stained with lead citrate and uranyl acetate , and imaged using Jeol-1010 transmission electron microscope . The images for EM sections were assessed using Image J software and the inner and outer axonal area was measured for g-ratio analysis and quantified in 50 axons per animal with n = 3 per group as previously published ( Lancaster et al . , 2018 ) . The axons were classified as normally myelinated , unmyelinated axons ( no myelin detected ) or thinly myelinated ( compared to normal WT tissue ) in WT , Tubb4aD249N and Tubb4aD249N optic nerves ( n = 3/group ) . The percentage of these three groups were plotted and the data was analyzed . Primary oligodendrocyte precursor cells ( OPCs ) were isolated from cerebral cortices of WT , Tubb4aD249N/+ and Tubb4aD249N/D249N mice between postnatal day P4-P7 using the Miltenyl anti-O4 microbeads ( Flores-Obando et al . , 2018 ) ( Appendix 1 ) . O4+ cells were plated at the density of 20 , 000 OPCs per well of a 24 well plate , allowed to proliferate for 5–7 days , following which they were differentiated in the media without platelet-derived growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor and with thyroxine T4 ( 20 μg/ml ) for another 5 days . The cells were then fixed with 4% PFA , washed twice with 1X PBS , permeabilized with 0 . 2% Triton X-100 , blocked in 10% normal goat serum solution for 1 hr , and incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies – rabbit anti-Olig2 ( 1:800; EMD Millipore , Cat: AB9610 ) , rat anti-PLP ( 1:1 ) , mouse anti-A2B5 ( 1:1 ) , rabbit anti-Caspase3 ( 1:200 ) and rat anti-MBP ( 1:1 ) ( IDDRC hybridoma , courtesy Dr . Judith Grinspan ) . The cells were washed the next day in PBS , and incubated with the appropriate secondary fluorescent antibodies ( 1:500; anti-rat IgG Alexa Fluor 488 , anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 647; 1:500; anti-mouse IgM Alexa Fluor 488 ) , mounted in Prolong gold antifade reagent ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) , and imaged using a Nikon microscope with 20 × or 40 × objectives for analysis of cellular counts . Each experiment was repeated at least three separate times and based on the litters , 1–3 pups of the same genotype were used with technical replicate of n = 3/ pup for each experiment . Primary cortical neurons were isolated from E15 . 5 embryos of WT , Tubb4aD249N/+ , and Tubb4aD249N/D249N mice as described previously ( Guedes-Dias et al . , 2019 ) . In brief , the cortex was dissected from each embryo and washed with Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution ( HBSS ) , then 2 . 5% trypsin was added to each sample and incubated at 37°C for seven mins . The trypsin was removed and washed four times with fresh warm HBSS and then resuspended in attachment medium ( described in SI ) . The cells were dissociated and plated on poly-L-lysine ( PLL ) coated MatTek dishes at a density of 150 , 000 cells/plate for imaging and 100 , 000 cells/well of a 24 well plate . The medium was changed after 4 hr to pre-equilibrated maintenance media ( described in SI ) . After 3 days , 20–30% of the medium was replaced with fresh medium supplemented with the mitotic inhibitor 1 μM Cytosine arabinoside . The neurons were plated at equal densities for all genotypes in 24-well plate were assessed for cell survival , axonal and dendritic length at 1 week post-plating . Neurons were immunostained with anti-microtubule associated protein ( MAP2; 1:200; Sigma , Cat: 1406 ) and anti- Neuron-specific Class III β-tubulin ( TuJ1; 1:200; Abcam , Cat: ab18207 ) , labelled by appropriate secondary fluorescent antibodies ( 1:500; anti-rat IgG Alexa Fluor 488 , anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 647 ) , and imaged using a Nikon microscope with at 20 × or 40 × objective for cellular counts and measuring axonal and dendritic length using the Neurite tracer plugin in FiJi software . Each experiment was repeated at least three separate times and based on the litters , 1–3 pups of the same genotype were used with technical replicate of n = 3/ pup for each experiment . On day in vitro ( DIV ) 6 , cortical neurons were transfected with end-binding protein 3 ( EB3 ) -mCherry using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) . 20–24 hr after transfection , maintenance medium was exchanged to low fluorescence Hibernate E imaging medium ( BrainBits ) supplemented with 2% B27 and 2 mM GlutaMAX . The neurons were imaged in an environmental chamber at 37°C on a PerkinElmer UltraView Vox Spinning Disk Confocal system with a Nikon Eclipse Ti inverted microscope using a Plan Apochromat 60 × 1 . 40 NA oil immersion objective . Axons were identified by established morphological criteria and images were acquired with a Hamamatsu EMCCD C9100-50 camera driven by Volocity software ( PerkinElmer ) at a rate of 2 s per frame for 600 s . Quantification of EB3 dynamics was performed as previously described ( Guedes-Dias et al . , 2019 ) . The ImageJ macro toolset KymoClear was used to generate kymographs ( Mangeol et al . , 2016 ) . The KymoClear toolset passes a Fourier filter on the original kymograph allowing for automated discrimination of anterograde , retrograde or static components and improves the signal-to-noise ratio of EB3 comets without affecting quantitative analysis of the data . The tracks of individual EB3 comets were manually traced using a custom MATLAB GUI ( Kymograph Suite ) and used to determine run-length , run-time , and velocity of each comet . The investigator was blinded for the neuronal genotype during both image acquisition and kymograph analysis . Each experiment was repeated at least three separate times and based on the litters , 1–3 pups of the same genotype were used with technical replicate of n = 3/ pup for each experiment . All graph data are presented as the mean ± standard error mean ( SEM ) . For mouse studies , ‘n’ represents the number of animals used per experiment unless indicated otherwise . Gait abnormalities , righting reflex , rotarod , and weight assessments were analyzed by two-way ANOVA with repeated measures followed by the post-hoc Tukey test . For grip strength and ambulation , one-way ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey test was performed . Survival was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method , and the differences between groups were estimated by the Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon test . Comparisons in myelin quantification , NeuN , ASPA , NG2 , Olig2 , Ki-67 and cleaved caspase three counts and fluorescent intensity were analyzed by ordinary two-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons post-hoc Tukey tests . EM analysis for G-ratio and axon diameter was conducted using one-way ANOVA with the post-hoc Tukey test and the % myelin analysis was conducted with two-way ANOVA followed by post-hoc Tukey test .

These findings collectively support the concept that GqPCR activation functions as a molecular switch to favor capillary TRPV4 activity over Kir2 . 1 signaling , an observation with potentially profound significance for the control of cerebral blood flow .", "plain language summary": "Capillaries form branching networks that surround all cells of the body . They allow oxygen and nutrient exchange between blood and tissue , but this is not their only role . Capillaries in the brain form a tight barrier that prevents components carried in the blood from easily reaching the brain compartment . They also detect the activity of neurons and trigger on-demand increases in blood flow to active regions of the brain . This role , revealed only recently , depends upon ion channels on the surface of the capillary cells . Active neurons release potassium ions , which open a type of ion channel called Kir2 . 1 that allows potassium inside the cell to flow out . This process is repeated in neighboring capillary cells until it reaches an upstream vessel , where it causes the vessel to relax and increase the blood flow . Kir2 . 1 channels sit astride the membranes of capillary cells , where they can interact with other membrane molecules . One such molecule , called PIP2 , plays several roles in relaying signals from the outside to the inside of cells . It also physically interacts with channels in the membrane , including Kir2 . 1 channels . If PIP2 levels are low , Kir2 . 1 channel activity decreases . Here , Harraz et al . discovered that capillary cells contain another type of ion channel , called TRPV4 , which is also regulated by PIP2 . But unlike Kir2 . 1 , its activity increases when PIP2 levels drop . Moreover , TRPV4 channels allow sodium and calcium ions to flow into the cell , which has an effect opposite to that of potassium flowing out of the cell . Capillary cells also have receptor proteins called GqPCRs that are activated by chemical signals released by active neurons in the brain . GqPCRs break down PIP2 , so their activity turns Kir2 . 1 channels off and TRPV4 channels on . This resets the system so that it is ready to respond to new signals from active neurons . GqPCRs work as molecular switches to control the balance between Kir2 . 1 and TRPV4 channels and turn brain blood flow up and down . GqPCRs and ion channels that depend on PIP2 can also be found in other types of cells . These findings could reveal clues about how signals are switched on and off in different cells . Understanding the role of PIP2 in signaling could also unveil what happens when signaling go wrong .", "article": "1 Introduction Endothelial cells ( ECs ) line the lumen of all blood vessels and are important regulators of artery and arteriole smooth muscle contractility . In capillaries , which lack an overlying smooth muscle cell layer , this regulatory function is absent . In these smallest of all blood vessels , ECs instead support the nutrient- and gas-exchange function characteristic of capillary beds generally . In the brain , capillary ECs ( cECs ) also constitute the blood-brain barrier , reflecting the presence of tight junctions between adjacent cECs . Not surprisingly given these differing cellular missions , the molecular repertoire of brain cECs and arterial/arteriolar ECs exhibit some marked differences . Notably , intermediate and small-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels ( IK and SK , respectively ) , which are important in transducing elevations in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ( [Ca2+]i ) into membrane potential hyperpolarization in artery/arteriolar ECs to cause relaxation of electrically coupled smooth muscle cells ( Ledoux et al . , 2008; Sonkusare et al . , 2012; Taylor et al . , 2003 ) , are absent in brain cECs ( Longden et al . , 2017 ) . However , signaling through G protein–coupled receptors of the Gαq/11-subtype ( GqPCRs ) —an important component of this smooth muscle regulatory axis—is robust in brain cECs ( Harraz et al . , 2018 ) . In the canonical pathway of GqPCR signaling , Gαq released upon agonist binding activates phospholipase C ( PLC ) , which hydrolyzes the minor inner leaflet phospholipid , phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5-bisphosphate ( PIP2 ) . Breakdown of PIP2 yields diacylglycerol ( DAG ) and inositol 1 , 4 , 5-trisphosphate ( IP3 ) , the latter of which increases [Ca2+]i by acting on its cognate receptor ( IP3R ) on the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) to promote Ca2+ release from intracellular stores . Blood delivery within the brain is mediated by an ever-narrowing vascular tree comprising surface arteries , penetrating ( parenchymal ) arterioles and a vast network of capillaries , which enormously extend the territory of perfusion ( Blinder et al . , 2013 ) . Because the brain lacks substantial energy reserves , it relies on an on-demand mechanism for redistributing oxygen and nutrients to regions of higher neuronal activity , a process in which products released by active neurons trigger a local increase in blood flow . This use-dependent increase in local blood flow ( functional hyperemia ) , mediated by a process termed neurovascular coupling ( NVC ) , is essential for normal brain function ( Iadecola and Nedergaard , 2007 ) and represents the physiological basis for functional magnetic resonance imaging ( Raichle and Mintun , 2006 ) . We recently reported that brain capillaries act as a neuronal activity-sensing network , demonstrating that brain cECs are capable of initiating an electrical ( hyperpolarizing ) signal in response to neuronal activity that rapidly propagates upstream to dilate feeding parenchymal arterioles and increase blood flow locally at the site of signal initiation ( Longden et al . , 2017 ) . We also established the molecular mechanism underlying this process , showing that extracellular K+—a byproduct of every neuronal action potential—is the critical mediator and identifying the Kir2 . 1 channel as the key molecular player ( Longden et al . , 2017 ) . Kir2 . 1 channels are activated by external K+ and exhibit steep activation by hyperpolarization ( Hibino et al . , 2010; Longden and Nelson , 2015 ) , characteristics that facilitate regenerative K+ conductance in neighboring cECs and enable long-range propagation of the hyperpolarizing signal ( Longden et al . , 2017 ) . Intriguingly , we have since discovered that decreases in capillary endothelial PIP2 levels induced by GqPCRs agonists suppress Kir2 . 1 channel currents , reflecting the fact that PIP2 is required for Kir2 . 1 channel activity ( Harraz et al . , 2018 ) . Importantly , this suppressive effect of PIP2 depletion exerts a major modulatory influence on K+-evoked hyperemic responses in vivo . In addition to regulating Kir2 family members , PIP2 has been shown to bind to and regulate a diverse array of ion channels ( Hille et al . , 2015 ) . Notable in this context , PIP2 binding has been shown to inhibit several members of the transient receptor potential ( TRP ) family of non-selective cation channels , including the vanilloid subtype TRPV4 ( Nilius et al . , 2008; Rohacs , 2009; Takahashi et al . , 2014 ) , which we and others have shown is an important Ca2+ influx pathway in arterial and arteriolar ECs ( Earley and Brayden , 2015; Sonkusare et al . , 2014;Sonkusare et al . , 2012; White et al . , 2016 ) . The Kir2 . 1 channel appears to be the major K+ channel type in brain cECs ( Longden et al . , 2017 ) . However , the identity of depolarizing ( Na+/Ca2+-permeable ) channels in cECs is not known . Here , we show that TRPV4 channels are present in cECs and exhibit an exceedingly low open probability under basal conditions due to tonic inhibition by PIP2 . We have further found that this inhibition is relieved through PIP2 depletion , independent of the action of the PIP2 hydrolysis products , DAG and IP3 . These findings provide a counterpoint to our recent demonstration that Kir2 . 1 channel activity is sustained by basal levels of PIP2 and suppressed by GqPCR-mediated PIP2 depletion ( Harraz et al . , 2018 ) . Collectively , our findings indicate that PIP2 exerts opposite effects on TRPV4 and Kir2 . 1 channels in brain cECs , demonstrating that a single regulatory pathway governs the balance between two divergent signaling modalities—one depolarizing and the other hyperpolarizing—in the capillary endothelium . 2 Results We previously reported that the selective TRPV4 agonist GSK1016790A ( hereafter GSK101 ) is a potent activator of TRPV4 currents in mesenteric artery ECs that induces maximal arterial dilation at concentrations in the low nanomolar range ( Sonkusare et al . , 2014; Sonkusare et al . , 2012 ) . To assess TRPV4 channel expression and function in brain cECs , we first performed patch-clamp electrophysiology experiments on freshly isolated cECs from C57BL/6J mouse brain slices , prepared as described in Materials and methods . Specifically , we recorded outward K+ currents mediated by TRPV4 channels in the cytoplasm-intact , perforated whole-cell configuration using a 300 ms ramp protocol ( −100 to +100 mV , from a holding potential of −50 mV ) . Recordings were made in the presence of the voltage-dependent pore blocker ruthenium red ( RuR; 1 µM ) , an approach we have previously used to assess TRPV4 currents in mesenteric artery ECs ( Sonkusare et al . , 2012 ) . Under these conditions , depolarizing ramps rapidly displace RuR , allowing unimpeded outward K+ currents to be detected while preventing Na+/Ca2+ influx and associated Ca2+ overload and cell death ( Sonkusare et al . , 2012 ) . Unexpectedly , we found that GSK101 was unable to evoke a detectable whole-cell TRPV4 current in cECs at concentrations that maximally activate TRPV4 channels in mesenteric artery ECs; in fact , even GSK101 concentrations as high as 100 nM failed to stimulate a detectable TRPV4 current in isolated cECs ( Figure 1A ) . However , we serendipitously found that breaking through the cell membrane from a perforated patch in the presence of an otherwise ineffective GSK101 concentration ( 100 nM ) resulted in the gradual ( ~5 min ) development of a robust TRPV4 current , suggesting that a factor that suppresses TRPV4 channels had been washed out of the cell . In the conventional whole-cell configuration with physiological levels of Mg-ATP ( 1 mM ) included in the patch pipette , application of 100 nM GSK101 also failed to evoke an outward current . In striking contrast , this same concentration of GSK101 caused the gradual ( ~4–5 min ) development of a robust outward current in the conventional whole-cell configuration when Mg-ATP was omitted from the pipette solution ( Figure 1A ) . Collectively , these observations suggest that ATP is the suppressive factor in question . Consistent with this interpretation , intracellular Mg-ATP ( 1 mM ) caused a dramatic shift in the sensitivity of cEC TRPV4 channels to GSK101: at a potential of 100 mV , the EC50 of GSK101 for TRPV4 channels in the presence of Mg-ATP was 415 nM . However , in the absence of Mg-ATP , the EC50 was reduced ~23 fold to 18 nM ( Figure 1C; Figure 1—figure supplement 1A , B ) , a value comparable to that observed in mesenteric artery ECs ( Sonkusare et al . , 2014 ) . The suppressive effect of ATP was specific for adenosine nucleotides , as inclusion of 1 mM GTP in the patch pipette did not alter currents ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1C ) . GSK101-induced currents were completely abolished by the selective TRPV4 channel antagonist HC-067047 ( 1 µM ) and were absent in cECs from TRPV4-knockout ( TRPV4-/- ) mice ( Figure 1B; Figure 1—source data 1 ) , confirming that these currents are attributable to TRPV4 channels . The inhibitory effect of intracellular Mg-ATP ( 1 mM ) was not limited to GSK101-activated TRPV4 currents . As shown ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ) , it also suppressed both inward and outward currents in cECs activated by the TRPV4 agonist 4α-phorbol 12 , 13-didecanoate ( 4α-PDD; 5 µM , in the absence of RuR ) . There was no detectable whole-cell TRPV4 current in the absence of a TRPV4 activator ( Figure 1A ) , suggesting that these channels have a very low basal open probability . To further investigate this , we monitored single TRPV4 channel openings using dialyzed cECs in the conventional whole-cell configuration , an approach that should allow detection of openings of all channels throughout the cEC plasma membrane while controlling intracellular composition . First , we measured TRPV4 unitary currents in dialyzed cECs ( 0 mM Mg-ATP ) held at +50 mV before and after the application of 100 nM GSK101 . The unitary current amplitude in the presence of GSK101 , estimated from amplitude histograms , was 4 . 6 ± 0 . 3 pA ( n = 3 ) ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3A ) . This value corresponds to a single-channel conductance of 92 ± 6 pS , in line with values reported in an earlier investigation of TRPV4 channels in native arterial ECs ( Watanabe et al . , 2002 ) and heterologous expression systems ( Loukin et al . , 2010 ) . Extending these results , we next performed a series of single-channel recordings in the absence of GSK101 . cECs held at +50 mV and dialyzed with Mg-ATP ( 1 mM ) displayed infrequent openings ( NPO = 0 . 038 ± 0 . 006 ) , but removing ATP increased single-channel opening by ~6 fold ( NPO = 0 . 209 ± 0 . 044 ) ( Figure 1D; Figure 1—source data 3 ) . Single-channel openings in the absence of agonist exhibited a unitary current of 4 . 5 ± 0 . 3 pA at +50 mV ( Figure 1D , Figure 1—figure supplement 3B ) , similar to that evoked using a specific TRPV4 agonist ( 4 . 6 pA ) ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3A ) and corresponding to a conductance of 90 ± 6 pS . Single-channel currents recorded in the absence of GSK101 were inhibited by the TRPV4 blocker HC-067047 ( NPO = 0 . 063 ± 0 . 028 ) ( Figure 1D; Figure 1—source data 3 ) , confirming their identity as TRPV4 channel-mediated currents . Based on our estimate of ~225 functional TRPV4 channels per cEC ( see Materials and methods ) , we calculate that capillary TRPV4 channels have a basal open probability ( PO ) of ~0 . 0002 . These observations collectively indicate that capillary TRPV4 channels exhibit a low open probability under basal conditions , and that both constitutive and agonist-induced TRPV4 activities are suppressed by intracellular ATP and recover following ATP washout/dialysis . The Mg2+ salt of ATP is readily hydrolyzable and can be utilized by kinases ( O'Rourke , 1993 ) . To test whether TRPV4 suppression requires ATP hydrolysis , we replaced ATP in the patch pipette with the poorly hydrolyzable analog , ATP-γ-S ( 1 mM ) . Under these conditions , GSK101 ( 100 nM ) increased TRPV4 currents to same extent as observed in cells dialyzed with 0 mM Mg-ATP , indicating that ATP hydrolysis is required for channel inhibition ( Figure 2A , B; Figure 2—source data 1 ) . This implies an energy-consuming process , and suggests the involvement of an enzyme , possibly a kinase . Coordination of Mg2+ is critical for kinase-mediated phosphoryl transfer reactions ( O'Rourke , 1993; Ryves and Harwood , 2001; Zakharian et al . , 2011 ) . Thus , the prediction is that ATP would be unable to inhibit TPRV4 currents in the absence of the cofactor Mg2+ if a kinase underlies Mg-ATP–mediated TRPV4 inhibition . Consistent with this prediction , replacing Mg-ATP in the patch pipette with the Na+ salt of ATP ( Na-ATP , 1 mM ) while eliminating Mg2+ from the pipette solution abolished the suppressive effect of ATP ( Figure 2B; Figure 2—source data 1 ) , suggesting the contribution of a kinase to this process . On the basis of these observations , we next tested the involvement of protein kinases by bath-applying the protein kinase A ( PKA ) inhibitor H-89 ( 1 µM ) , protein kinase G ( PKG ) inhibitor KT5823 ( 1 µM ) , or protein kinase C ( PKC ) inhibitor calphostin C ( 0 . 5 µM ) . We then monitored outward TRPV4-mediated currents as described above . None of these inhibitors affected currents in cells dialyzed with Mg-ATP ( Figure 2C; Figure 2—source data 2 ) , ruling out a role for these protein kinases in TRPV4 inhibition . Further support for this conclusion is provided by the observation that lower concentrations of Mg-ATP ( 10 and 100 µM ) —which activate the majority of protein kinases ( Knight and Shokat , 2005 ) —failed to effectively inhibit TRPV4 currents in cECs ( Figure 2D; Figure 2—source data 3 ) . Lipid kinases , like protein kinases , also hydrolyze ATP , but typically require higher ATP concentrations ( Hilgemann , 1997; Knight and Shokat , 2005; Xie et al . , 1999 ) . The requirement for millimolar Mg-ATP concentrations to effectively inhibit TRPV4 currents ( Figure 1C , Figure 2D ) is thus more consistent with lower ATP-affinity lipid kinases like those involved in phosphoinositide synthesis ( Balla and Balla , 2006 ) . In this cascade ( Figure 3A ) , phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase ( PI4K ) utilizes ATP to phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol ( PI ) , converting it to phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate ( PIP ) , which in turn is phosphorylated to PIP2 by phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase ( PIP5K ) , a step that also requires ATP . Thus , the cellular levels of PIP2 are maintained through an ATP-hydrolysis–dependent process ( Baukrowitz et al . , 1998; Hilgemann , 1997; Suh and Hille , 2002 ) . To assess the possible involvement of this pathway in capillary TRPV4 suppression , we tested the effects of four structurally unrelated pharmacological inhibitors of PI4K: wortmannin ( 50 µM ) , PIK93 ( 300 nM ) , phenylarsine oxide ( PAO; 30 µM ) , and LY294002 ( 300 µM ) . In each case , inhibitors of PIP2 synthesis significantly reversed TRPV4 channel inhibition by ATP ( Figure 3B; Figure 3—source data 1 ) , despite the high intracellular Mg-ATP concentration ( 1 mM ) . Notably , at concentrations below those necessary to inhibit PI4K ( but sufficient to suppress phosphoinositide 3-kinases ) , the inhibitors wortmannin ( 0 . 1 µM ) and LY294002 ( 10 µM ) failed to increase TRPV4 current in cECs ( Figure 3B; Figure 3—source data 1 ) . Collectively , these observations indicate the involvement of the ATP/PI4K regulatory axis , and presumably PIP2 , in suppressing TRPV4 channels in cECs . PIP2 is a well-established regulator of membrane proteins , including ion channels ( Hille et al . , 2015; Huang et al . , 1998; Nilius et al . , 2008 ) . To directly test whether PIP2 inhibits TRPV4 channels in cECs , we introduced the water-soluble , short acyl chain dioctanoyl PIP2 ( diC8-PIP2 ) via the patch pipette . In the absence of Mg-ATP , diC8-PIP2 inhibited GSK101-induced TRPV4 currents , reducing them by 70–80% at concentrations of 10 to 50 µM ( Figure 3C , D; Figure 3—source data 2 ) . Similar inhibition was observed with the longer-chain PIP2 analog , diC16-PIP2 ( 10 µM ) ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) . Moreover , scavenging endogenous , negatively charged PIP2 with intracellular poly-L-lysine ( 3 µg/ml , molecular weight 15 , 000–30 , 000 ) , included in the patch pipette , attenuated Mg-ATP effects on GSK101-induced TRPV4 currents ( Figure 3E , F; Figure 3—source data 3 ) . Taken together , these data show that PIP2 inhibits both GSK101-induced and constitutive TRPV4 channel activity in cECs . The primary mechanism responsible for reducing PIP2 levels is activation of GqPCRs and subsequent PLC-mediated PIP2 hydrolysis . To determine whether endothelial GqPCR-activation–mediated PIP2 depletion relieves the inhibition of TRPV4 channels , we examined the effects of GqPCR agonists on constitutive single-channel TRPV4 currents in cECs under simulated physiological conditions ( i . e . dialyzed with Mg-ATP ) ( Figure 1D ) . We first tested the effects of prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2 ) , a postulated NVC agent that acts on Gq-coupled EP1 receptors in cECs to deplete PIP2 ( Harraz et al . , 2018 ) and has previously been proposed to act through Gs-protein-coupled EP2 and EP4 receptors to cause vasodilation ( Lacroix et al . , 2015; Zonta et al . , 2003 ) . PGE2 significantly increased TRPV4 single-channel open probability in the absence of GSK101 ( Figure 4A , B ) , increasing NPO ~6 fold ( Figure 4C; Figure 4—source data 1 ) . This enhancement was similar to that observed under conditions in which intracellular Mg-ATP was excluded from the pipette solution ( in the absence of either a receptor agonist or GSK101; Figure 1D ) , suggesting that PGE2 acts through PIP2 depletion to relieve PIP2-mediated inhibition and restore TRPV4 channel activity . To confirm that PIP2 depletion underlies PGE2-induced activation of TRPV4 channels , we next employed a series of conventional whole-cell recordings and pharmacological interventions to test the different components in the proposed pathway . In these experiments , cECs were dialyzed with 1 mM Mg-ATP—a maneuver sufficient to significantly suppress TRPV4 channels even in the presence of 100 nM GSK101 ( Figure 1A , C ) . As predicted , application of PGE2 ( 2 µM ) in the presence of GSK101 greatly increased TRPV4 currents in cECs dialyzed with Mg-ATP ( Figure 5A , B; Figure 5—source data 1 ) . Currents evoked by PGE2 application were inhibited by the TRPV4 antagonist HC-067047 ( 1 µM ) and were absent in cECs from TRPV4-/- animals , confirming that they are mediated by TRPV4 channels ( Figure 5C; Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) . Introduction of the PIP2 analog diC8-PIP2 ( 10 µM ) in the pipette solution or inhibition of PLC using U73122 ( 10 µM ) —pharmacological interventions that serve to compensate for or prevent PLC-dependent PIP2 degradation , respectively—prevented the increase in TRPV4 currents by PGE2 ( Figure 5C; Figure 5—figure supplement 1; Figure 5—source data 2 ) . The non-selective prostanoid receptor ( EP1/EP2/EP3 ) antagonist AH6809 ( 10 µM ) also prevented this effect of PGE2 , as did the selective EP1 antagonist SC51322 ( 1 µM ) , suggesting that PGE2 acts through the EP1 receptor . U73343 , the inactive analog of the PLC inhibitor U73122 , did not alter PGE2 effects ( Figure 5C; Figure 5—source data 2 ) . Collectively , these observations suggest that PGE2 signals through the EP1-PLC pathway to deplete PIP2 and thereby relieve PIP2-mediated TRPV4 inhibition . The PIP2 breakdown products , DAG and IP3 , stimulate PKC activity and promote Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum , respectively . To rule out the involvement of these pathways in the PGE2-induced increase in TRPV4 currents , we first tested the effects of the PKC inhibitors , Gö6976 ( 1 µM ) and calphostin C ( 0 . 5 µM ) , and found that neither altered PGE2-induced activation of TRPV4 channels ( Figure 5C; Figure 5—source data 2 ) . To determine whether intracellular Ca2+ signals downstream of EP1-PLC activation by PGE2 are involved in TRPV4 disinhibition , we blocked Ca2+ reuptake into intracellular stores by inhibiting the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase ( SERCA ) pump with cyclopiazonic acid ( CPA; 30 µM ) or by rapidly chelating cytoplasmic Ca2+ with BAPTA ( 5 . 4 mM ) . Neither maneuver attenuated PGE2-induced disinhibition of TRPV4 channel activity ( Figure 5C; Figure 5—source data 2 ) , arguing against a major contribution of DAG-PKC or IP3-Ca2+ signaling to this effect . Taken together , our data show that PGE2 activates EP1 receptors and downstream PLC to deplete PIP2 and thereby relieve TRPV4 channel inhibition , independently of PIP2 metabolites . Carbachol ( 10 µM ) , which can signal through Gq-coupled muscarinic receptors , induced an increase in TRPV4 currents comparable to that produced by PGE2 ( Figure 5—figure supplement 2 ) , indicating that GqPCR-mediated TRPV4 activation is not restricted to prostanoid EP1 receptors . However , neither the purinergic receptor agonist , ATP ( 50 µM ) , nor the protease-activated receptor-2 ( PAR2 ) -activating peptide , SLIGRL-NH2 ( 5 µM ) , affected TRPV4 channel activity ( Figure 5—figure supplement 2 ) . The reason for these apparent differential effects of various GqPCRs is currently unclear , but could reflect differences in expression levels or cellular localization of the corresponding receptors , or receptor desensitization owing to ligand-dependent proteolysis ( PAR2 ) or receptor internalization ( e . g . P2Y subtypes ) ( Cho et al . , 2005a , 2005b; Dickson et al . , 2013; Jung et al . , 2016; Sromek and Harden , 1998; Vanlandewijck et al . , 2018 ) . PIP2 levels are key to the maintenance and activation of inward rectifier K+ channels , as reported recently by our group ( Harraz et al . , 2018 ) and others ( D'Avanzo et al . , 2010; Hansen et al . , 2011; Huang et al . , 1998 ) . Our current ( Figure 5 ) and previous ( Harraz et al . , 2018 ) findings indicate that GqPCR-activation–induced depletion of PIP2 exerts opposite effects on endothelial TRPV4 ( activation ) and Kir2 . 1 ( inhibition ) channels . In fact , GqPCR activation in cECs deactivates Kir2 . 1 currents through PIP2 hydrolysis and cripples capillary-to-arteriolar electrical signaling ( Harraz et al . , 2018 ) . It is thus conceivable that GqPCR-mediated signaling could shift the balance between TRPV4 and Kir2 . 1 signaling in brain capillaries through perturbation of endothelial PIP2 levels . To test this , we designed an experiment that allowed simultaneous monitoring of TRPV4 and Kir2 . 1 currents in the context of GqPCR-mediated changes in endothelial PIP2 levels . Using the perforated-patch configuration to maintain physiological levels of ATP and PIP2 , and bathing cECs in a solution containing an extracellular K+ concentration ( [K+]o ) of 60 mM to facilitate monitoring of Kir2 . 1 currents , we evoked TRPV4 currents with 2 µM GSK101 , a concentration sufficient to sub-maximally activate an outward current in this configuration ( in the presence of 1 µM RuR to block inward TRPV4 current ) . In this setting , application of PGE2 ( 2 µM ) enhanced TRPV4 currents and simultaneously inhibited Kir2 . 1 currents ( Figure 6A , B; Figure 6—source data 1 ) compared with matching time controls , which showed no significant change in either current ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1 ) . The onset of changes in TRPV4 and Kir2 . 1 currents in response to PGE2 was rapid ( <60 s ) . A kinetic analysis revealed that TRPV4 activation and Kir2 . 1 suppression were kinetically comparable , with times for half-maximal change in activity ( t0 . 5 ) of 3 . 4 min for TRPV4 and 4 . 4 min for Kir2 . 1 channels , and corresponding time constants ( τ ) of 4 . 9 and 6 . 4 min , respectively ( Figure 6C; Figure 6—source data 2 ) . The muscarinic receptor agonist carbachol ( 10 µM ) similarly facilitated TRPV4 currents and inhibited Kir2 . 1 currents ( Figure 6—figure supplement 2 ) . In contrast , purinergic receptor stimulation with ATP did not affect TRPV4 currents ( Figure 5—figure supplement 2; Figure 6—figure supplement 3 ) despite inhibiting Kir2 . 1 currents ( Figure 6—figure supplement 3 ) , as we reported previously ( Harraz et al . , 2018 ) . These findings collectively establish a potential mechanism by which PGE2 or other suitable GqPCR agonists , could alter the balance between electrical ( hyperpolarizing ) signaling mediated by Kir2 . 1 channels and TRPV4 channel signaling in capillaries through modulation of PIP2 levels ( Figure 7 ) . 3 Discussion We previously demonstrated that increases in [K+]o associated with neuronal activity alter cerebral blood flow at the capillary level , showing that extracellular K+ activates capillary Kir2 . 1 channels , triggering a retrograde electrical ( hyperpolarizing ) signal that propagates upstream to dilate feeding arterioles and enhance blood flow to the active region ( Longden et al . , 2017 ) . We have also shown that GqPCR-mediated PIP2 depletion inhibits capillary electrical signaling ( Harraz et al . , 2018 ) , identifying a point of intersection between electrical signaling and endothelial GqPCR activity . In the present study , we show that cECs express TRPV4 channels , and demonstrate that these channels are tonically suppressed by basal levels of PIP2 . Furthermore , we show that GqPCR activation relieves TRPV4 channel inhibition through PIP2 depletion . This paradigm introduces the phosphoinositide PIP2 as a master regulator of TRPV4 and Kir2 . 1 signaling in the capillary endothelium and highlights the ability of GqPCR activity to tune the balance of these signaling modalities to favor TRPV4 signaling ( Figure 7 ) . The repertoire of functional ion channels in brain cECs remains incompletely characterized , although certain molecular features have recently come into focus . For instance , our evidence suggests that the inward rectifier Kir2 . 1 channel is the major K+ channel type in brain cECs ( Longden et al . , 2017 ) , whereas Ca2+-sensitive SK and IK channels , which are present in arterial and arteriolar ECs and play a prominent role in regulating vascular tone ( Ledoux et al . , 2008; Sonkusare et al . , 2012; Taylor et al . , 2003 ) , are not expressed in brain cECs ( Longden et al . , 2017 ) . Notably , the identity of depolarizing ( Na+ and/or Ca2+-permeable ) channels in cECs , which we predict must be present to allow the membrane potential to reset to support repeated operation of our previously reported Kir2 . 1-dependent electrical signaling-based NVC mechanism , is not known . Our demonstration that the highly selective TRPV4 agonist , GSK101 , induced currents in brain cECs that were eliminated by the TRPV4-specific antagonist , HC-067047 , and were absent in cECs from TRPV4-/- mice firmly establishes the presence of this non-selective cation channel in capillaries . In arterial and arteriolar ECs , TRPV4 channel-mediated Ca2+ influx is closely linked to activation of Ca2+-sensitive SK and IK channels and subsequent membrane potential hyperpolarization ( Sonkusare et al . , 2012 ) . However , because cECs lack functional Ca2+-activated K+ channels ( Longden et al . , 2017 ) , TRPV4-mediated influx of Na+/Ca2+ in these cells instead would lead to membrane potential depolarization ( Behringer et al . , 2017; Earley and Brayden , 2015 ) . Collectively , these observations suggest that the TRPV4 channel is a major depolarizing element in cECs , although we cannot rule out the possibility that other , as yet unidentified , cation channels may contribute to membrane depolarization , as suggested by earlier studies ( Csanády and Adam-Vizi , 2004; Popp and Gögelein , 1992; Csanády and Adam-Vizi , 2003 ) . Our observations also highlight the fact that the functional role of TRPV4 channels is critically dependent on the expression and function of key associated proteins . Intriguingly , and in striking contrast to the case in peripheral arterial ECs ( Sonkusare et al . , 2014; Sonkusare et al . , 2012 ) , the open probability of capillary TRPV4 channels in cECs was remarkably low under basal conditions and was increased by dialyzing out intracellular contents—the first link in the chain leading to our discovery that TRPV4 channels in cECs are intrinsically inhibited by intracellular ATP . It is well established that lipid kinases involved in PIP2 synthesis require millimolar ATP for their activity ( Balla and Balla , 2006; Hilgemann , 1997; Knight and Shokat , 2005; Suer et al . , 2001 ) , and it has been amply demonstrated that PIP2 maintenance is dependent on ATP in multiple cell types ( Suh and Hille , 2008; Ye et al . , 2018; Zakharian et al . , 2011 ) , including cECs ( Harraz et al . , 2018 ) . Three major lines of evidence presented here support the conclusion that cytosolic ATP-dependent maintenance of sustained , basal levels of PIP2 suppresses TRPV4 channel activity . First , millimolar concentrations of hydrolyzable ATP suppressed capillary TRPV4 channel activity . Second , inclusion of PIP2 analogs in the patch pipette inhibited TRPV4 currents . Third , scavenging PIP2 or inhibiting its synthesis abrogated ATP-mediated inhibition . Notably , PIP2 has been reported to directly interact with different residues on the TRPV4 N-terminus in heterologous expression systems ( Garcia-Elias et al . , 2013; Takahashi et al . , 2014 ) . However , these studies reached discrepant conclusions , with one suggesting that direct binding of PIP2 to the ankyrin repeat domain of the TRPV4 channel inhibits different modes of TRPV4 activation ( Takahashi et al . , 2014 ) and the other reporting that PIP2 is necessary for heat- , hypotonicity- or epoxyeicosatrienoic acid ( EET ) -induced channel activation by facilitating structural rearrangements of the channel ( Garcia-Elias et al . , 2013 ) . These discrepancies may reflect divergent effects of PIP2 on channel behavior through binding to multiple sites in the channel . Intriguingly , the putative endogenous TRPV4 channel activator ( Earley and Brayden , 2015; Watanabe et al . , 2003 ) 11 , 12-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid ( 11 , 12-EET , 1 µM ) evoked currents in cECs even in the absence of dialyzed PIP2 ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2 ) . In any case , our results are the first to report PIP2-mediated suppression of TRPV4 channels in the endothelium and more broadly in native cells and are congruent with the results of Takahashi et al . , 2014 . Interestingly , a recent study provided structural evidence that lipid molecules are tightly bound to the selectivity filter of the TRPV4 channel pore , although the identity and function of these lipids were not characterized ( Deng et al . , 2018 ) . Canonical GqPCR signaling involves PLC activation and subsequent PIP2 breakdown into DAG and IP3 . Receptor agonists that activate GqPCRs can dramatically lower PIP2 by promoting its hydrolysis at rates that exceed those of PIP2 re-synthesis . We show here that PGE2 , which has previously been postulated to act as an NVC agent through actions on Gs-coupled EP2/EP4 receptors in arteriolar smooth muscle ( Lacroix et al . , 2015; Zonta et al . , 2003 ) , activates TRPV4 channels in cECs independent of the action of the PIP2 metabolites , DAG and IP3 , by relieving PIP2-mediated suppression ( Figure 4 , Figure 5 ) . In contrast , we recently showed that GqPCR agonists exert the opposite effect on capillary Kir2 . 1 channels , inhibiting their ability to mediate capillary-to-arteriole electrical signaling ( Harraz et al . , 2018 ) . In keeping with these previous findings and our current observations , simultaneous monitoring of TRPV4 and Kir2 . 1 channel currents confirmed the bidirectional effects of GqPCR agonists on the two channels ( Figure 6 ) . This two-way modulation ( Figure 7 ) is unique as it indicates that a single GqPCR signaling cascade is capable of altering the balance between electrical Kir2 . 1 signaling ( inhibition ) and TRPV4 signaling ( facilitation ) . Given the absence of Ca2+-activated K+ channels in cECs , noted above , GqPCR signaling-induced PIP2 depletion would likely depolarize cECs through the simultaneous disinhibition of depolarizing TRPV4 channels ( this study ) and deactivation of hyperpolarizing Kir2 . 1 channels ( Harraz et al . , 2018 ) . Based on our direct Kir2 . 1 current measurements ( Harraz et al . , 2018; Longden et al . , 2017 ) and the known voltage- and K+-dependence of Kir2 . 1 channels ( Longden and Nelson , 2015 ) , we estimate that the outward current through these channels at physiological membrane potentials ( about −40 mV ) and external K+ ( 3 mM ) is ~6 fA . Elevation of external K+ to 10 mM would increase Kir2 current at this voltage to ~260 fA . Though seemingly miniscule , such small membrane currents are precisely what is needed to ensure conduction fidelity . We have measured a sustained and profound hyperpolarization of about −25 mV in arteriolar smooth muscle in response to capillary stimulation with 10 mM K+ ( Longden et al . , 2017 ) . Our computational modeling indicates that a stable membrane hyperpolarization of 25 mV requires the outward ( hyperpolarizing ) current to greatly exceed the inward ( depolarizing ) current . Our estimate of basal , PIP2-suppressed TRPV4 current at −40 mV is about −80 fA . GqPCR activation increases open probability ~6 fold , producing a current ( 400–500 fA ) sufficient to effectively short circuit K+-induced hyperpolarization and cripple this key Kir2 . 1-based NVC mechanism . In conclusion , the low level of TRPV4 channel activity aligns with the functional role of capillaries . Activation of capillary GqPCRs should also trigger Ca2+ signals in cECs , presumably through IP3-mediated Ca2+ release from intracellular stores as well as disinhibition of TRPV4 channels ( as described here ) and subsequent Ca2+ influx . Such capillary Ca2+ signals should positively influence hemodynamics—and thus functional hyperemia—providing a plausible explanation for the role of GqPCR agonists in the NVC process , presumably through the Ca2+-dependent activation of nitric oxide synthase ( NOS ) and subsequent release of the vasodilator , NO ( Förstermann et al . , 1991; Marziano et al . , 2017 ) . Capillary Ca2+ signaling might also serve an entirely different purpose in functional hyperemia: because local Ca2+ signals represent sites of PIP2 depletion ( through GqPCR signaling ) , and thus membrane potential depolarization ( through TRPV4 disinhibition and Kir2 . 1 deactivation ) , they are likely to interfere with the progression of electrical signals generated further down the vascular tree . Accordingly , these signals may represent ‘stop signs’ or ‘speed bumps’ that play a role in redirecting hyperpolarizing ( vasodilatory ) signals away from certain brain areas , in addition to their role in resetting the capillary membrane potential , noted above . Given the role of PIP2 in negatively regulating TRPV4 channels , the exceedingly low basal TRPV4 activity and diminished sensitivity to GSK101 in cECs ( Figure 1 ) compared with mesenteric artery ECs ( Sonkusare et al . , 2012 ) suggest differences in the PIP2 ‘set point’ in these two vascular beds . This supposition has important physiological implications for electrical signaling in the brain . Our data suggest that PIP2 levels in brain cECs are sufficient to saturate Kir2 . 1 channels ( Harraz et al . , 2018 ) and tune TRPV4 channel currents to levels that prevent inappropriate depolarization of the membrane potential ( Figure 3 ) . In the absence of PIP2 suppression of TRPV4 channel-mediated inward currents , it is unlikely that increased outward K+ currents through Kir2 . 1 channels in response to elevated K+ would be sufficient to cause membrane potential hyperpolarization . The mechanistic basis for the apparently higher PIP2 set point in brain cECs is currently unknown , but could include lower constitutive GqPCR activity , lower microenvironmental levels of GqPCR agonists and/or decreased GqPCR expression—and thus diminished PIP2 breakdown . Along these lines , a recent single-cell transcriptomics analysis showed that Gαq ( Gnaq ) transcript levels in the mouse brain endothelium are reduced compared with those in peripheral pulmonary ECs ( Vanlandewijck et al . , 2018 ) . Alternatively , differences in the set point could be indicative of more robust PIP2 synthesis in brain capillaries , a speculation that is supported by the higher mitochondrial content—and hence ATP synthesis—in highly active brain cECs compared with other ECs ( Oldendorf and Brown , 1975; Oldendorf et al . , 1977 ) . In conclusion , this study provides compelling evidence that brain capillaries express TRPV4 channels and further shows that the activity of these channels is physiologically suppressed by basal levels of PIP2 . This introduces PIP2 and its modulation by GqPCR agonists as major regulators of brain capillary signaling . When maintained at sufficient levels , PIP2 inhibits TRPV4 channels and supports capillary-to-arteriole electrical signaling , but in response to GqPCR activation , PIP2 levels are reduced , enhancing TRPV4 signaling and inhibiting retrograde electrical signaling via Kir2 . 1 channels . Capillary GqPCRs can therefore be envisioned as molecular switches that dictate the signaling modality in the brain microvasculature . 4 Materials and methods All procedures involving animals received prior approval from the University of Vermont Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee . Adult ( 2–3 month old ) male C57BL/6J mice ( Jackson Laboratories , USA ) and TRPV4-/- mice ( Thorneloe et al . , 2008 ) were group-housed on a 12 hr light:dark cycle with environmental enrichment and free access to food and water . Animals were euthanized by intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital ( 100 mg/kg ) followed by rapid decapitation . 1 , 2-Dioctanoyl phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5-bisphosphate sodium salt ( diC8-PIP2 ) and 1 , 2-dipalmitoyl phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5-bisphosphate sodium salt ( diC16-PIP2 ) were purchased from Cayman Chemical ( USA ) . 12- ( 2-Cyanoethyl ) −6 , 7 , 12 , 13-tetrahydro-13-methyl-5-oxo-5H-indolo ( 2 , 3-a ) pyrrolo ( 3 , 4 c ) -carbazole ( Gö6976 ) was from Calbiochem ( USA ) .

Unless otherwise noted , all other chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich . Single ECs and capillary fragments were obtained from mouse brains by mechanical disruption of two 160 μm–thick brain slices using a Dounce homogenizer . Slices were homogenized in ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid ( 124 mM NaCl , 3 mM KCl , 2 mM CaCl2 , 2 mM MgCl2 , 1 . 25 mM NaH2PO4 , 26 mM NaHCO3 , 4 mM glucose ) , and debris was removed by passing the homogenate through a 62 µm nylon mesh . Retained capillary fragments were eluted into dissociation solution composed of 55 mM NaCl , 80 mM Na-glutamate , 5 . 6 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl2 , 4 mM glucose and 10 mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 3 ) , containing neutral protease ( 0 . 5 mg/mL ) and elastase ( 0 . 5 mg/mL ) ( Worthington , USA ) plus 100 µM CaCl2 , and incubated for 24 min at 37°C . Thereafter , 0 . 5 mg/ml collagenase type I ( Worthington ) was added and the sample was incubated for an additional 2 min at 37°C . The cell suspension was filtered and the residue was washed to remove enzymes . Single cells and small capillary fragments were dispersed by triturating 4–6 times with a fire-polished glass Pasteur pipette . Cells were stored in ice-cold isolation medium for use the same day ( within ~6 hr ) . All patch-clamp electrophysiological recordings were performed at room temperature ( ∼22°C ) in either the conventional or perforated whole-cell configuration . Currents were amplified using an Axopatch 200B amplifier , filtered at 1 kHz , digitized at 10 kHz , and stored on a computer for offline analysis with Clampfit 10 . 5 software . Recording pipettes were fabricated by pulling borosilicate glass ( 1 . 5 mm outer diameter , 1 . 17 mm inner diameter; Sutter Instruments , USA ) using a Narishige puller . Pipettes were fire-polished to reach a tip resistance of ~4–6 MΩ . The bath solution consisted of 80 or 134 mM NaCl , 60 or 6 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl2 , 10 mM HEPES , 4 mM glucose , and 2 mM CaCl2 ( pH 7 . 4 ) . For the conventional whole-cell configuration , pipettes were backfilled with a solution consisting of 10 mM NaOH , 11 . 4 mM KOH , 128 . 6 mM KCl , 1 . 1 mM MgCl2 , 2 . 2 mM CaCl2 , 5 mM EGTA , and 10 mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 2 ) . A subset of experiments utilized a Mg2+-free solution , obtained by excluding MgCl2 from the pipette solution . In another group of cells , EGTA was replaced with BAPTA ( 5 . 4 mM ) . For perforated-patch electrophysiology , the pipette solution was composed of 10 mM NaCl , 26 . 6 mM KCl , 110 mM K+ aspartate , 1 mM MgCl2 and 10 mM HEPES; amphotericin B ( 200–250 µg/ml ) was freshly added on the day of the experiment . Whole-cell capacitance , measured using the cancellation circuitry in the voltage-clamp amplifier , averaged 8 . 6 pF . TRPV4 membrane currents were measured using the conventional whole-cell configuration and physiological concentrations of salts . Ruthenium red ( RuR; 1 µM ) was used to block Ca2+ influx and thereby prevent Ca2+ overload . We have shown previously that RuR causes a voltage-dependent block of TRPV channels and is rapidly driven out of the pore by membrane depolarization; at +100 mV , RuR ( 1 µM ) blocks approximately 19% of the TRPV4 current ( Sonkusare et al . , 2012 ) . The number of TRPV4 channels activated by 100 nM GSK101 was estimated by dividing the GSK101-induced current at +100 mV by the unitary current at this voltage ( i . e . 10 pA ) ( Loukin et al . , 2010; Watanabe et al . , 2002 ) and correcting for the degree of RuR block . Data are expressed as means ± standard error of the mean ( SEM ) . Effects of a given condition/treatment on whole-cell current were compared using paired or unpaired t tests or analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) , as appropriate , using Graphpad Prism 7 . 01 software . p values≤0 . 05 were considered statistically significant .

One such process is bacterial sporulation: in stressful conditions , bacteria like Bacillus subtilis can divide to produce a smaller cell called a forespore , which the larger mother cell then engulfs . The forespore matures into a hardy spore , which is able to survive in harsh environments and only transform into an active bacterium when conditions improve . Bacterial cells are surrounded by a stiff layer of a material called peptidoglycan . This wall sits outside of the bacterium’s thin flexible membrane and determines the bacterium’s shape . At the beginning of sporulation , the forespore is separated from the mother cell by a peptidoglycan wall . Engulfment of the spore by the mother cell requires a dramatic change in the shape of this partition . Microbiologists had thought that all the rigid peptidoglycan must be degraded to allow the partition to deform flexibly during engulfment; however , no one had yet observed the tiny structures involved . Khanna et al . directly visualized sporulation in B . subtilis using a technique called cryo-electron tomography ( or cryo-ET for short ) . In cryo-ET , samples are cooled to low temperatures and then imaged with a beam of electrons . Cryo-ET requires thin samples , thinner even than most bacteria . By combing cryo-ET with another methodology that allowed them to focus in on thin sections of their sample , Khanna et al . generated high resolution images , which provided a look at forespore engulfment in unprecedented detail . These images revealed that the peptidoglycan wall separating the mother cell from forespore is not completely degraded: a thin layer of peptidoglycan persists . Comparing these images to cryo-ET images of cells treated with drugs that block the production of peptidoglycan suggested a new engulfment mechanism . This includes a cycle of peptidoglycan production and degradation that accompanies the advancing mother cell membrane as it surrounds the forespore during engulfment . Khanna et al . could also see that the mother cell’s membrane formed finger-like projections as it moved around the forespore , something that was not visible with previous techniques . This detailed engulfment mechanism is an important advance in the understanding of bacterial spore formation . Additionally , Khanna et al . have generated a collection of images , methods and analyses that may prove useful to a wide community of biologists attempting to understand sporulation and other fundamental processes that occur on a small scale .", "article": "1 Introduction From an architectural point of view , bacterial cells are among the simplest forms of life on the planet . Their cytoplasm is typically devoid of membrane bound organelles , and their cellular morphology relies upon a semi-rigid peptidoglycan ( PG ) cell wall that imposes its shape on the malleable cell membrane ( s ) . Bacterial cells are inflated by their high internal turgor pressure , which pushes the membranes against the cell wall , causing the PG to stretch and the cell to adopt its appropriate shape . Despite the apparent simplicity , studies in the past few decades have demonstrated that bacterial cellular architecture is far more complex than previously thought , in terms of both its ultrastructure and dynamic capabilities ( Hawver et al . , 2016; Wagstaff and Löwe , 2018; Wang et al . , 2013 ) . Endospore formation in Bacillus subtilis represents a striking example of the dynamic capabilities of bacterial cells , as it entails dramatic changes in cellular architecture . First , the division site shifts to polar position , generating a sporangium comprised of two cells: a larger mother cell and a smaller forespore ( Figure 1A; Errington , 2003; Higgins and Dworkin , 2012; Tan and Ramamurthi , 2014 ) . The polar septum traps the forespore chromosome , which is subsequently transported to the forespore by SpoIIIE , a membrane-anchored ATPase that assembles a translocation complex at septal midpoint ( Bath et al . , 2000; Yen Shin et al . , 2015; Wu and Errington , 1994; Wu and Errington , 1997 ) . Chromosome translocation increases the turgor pressure in the forespore , causing it to inflate and expand into the mother cell ( Lopez-Garrido et al . , 2018 ) . Simultaneously , the mother cell engulfs the forespore in a process that resembles eukaryotic phagocytosis ( Figure 1A ) . After engulfment , the forespore is fully enclosed within the cytoplasm of the mother cell , where it matures in a process that involves the synthesis of protective layers of cortex and coat , and the partial dehydration of the forespore cytoplasm . Finally , the mother cell lyses and the mature spore is released to the environment , where it remains dormant until the conditions are appropriate for germination . Engulfment represents a major rearrangement of the sporangium , from two cells that lie side by side to a cell within a cell . Such rearrangement likely involves a profound remodeling of the PG cell wall around the forespore , which would otherwise constrain the movement of the engulfing membrane . At the onset of engulfment , the engulfing mother cell membrane must circumvent the physical barrier posed by the septal PG in order to migrate around the forespore . This has led to the logical proposal that engulfment must entail the complete dissolution of the septal PG , a process often referred to as ‘septal thinning’ ( Chastanet and Losick , 2007; Illing and Errington , 1991; Perez et al . , 2000 ) . This proposal was supported by early electron microscopy studies of fixed and stained sporangia showing that engulfment-defective mutants had thicker septa than wild type sporangia ( Holt et al . , 1975; Illing and Errington , 1991; Rousseau and Hermier , 1975 ) . Further studies showed that engulfment requires three mother cell proteins: SpoIID , SpoIIM and SpoIIP , which form a complex ( DMP ) with PG degradation activity ( Abanes-De Mello et al . , 2002; Aung et al . , 2007; Chastanet and Losick , 2007; Morlot et al . , 2010 ) . In principle , DMP could mediate the complete dissolution of the septal PG to remove the steric block to the movement of the mother cell membrane around the forespore . The idea that septal PG is completely degraded has been more recently challenged by cryo-electron tomography ( cryo-ET ) images showing that a thin PG layer is present between the forespore and the mother cell membranes throughout engulfment ( Tocheva et al . , 2013 ) . It has also been shown that DMP-mediated PG degradation is required and rate-limiting for membrane migration even after the septal barrier has been bypassed , suggesting that DMP plays a role separate from the dissolution of septal PG ( Abanes-De Mello et al . , 2002; Gutierrez et al . , 2010 ) . In addition , the movement of the mother cell membrane also requires PG synthesis at the leading edge of the engulfing membrane ( Meyer et al . , 2010; Ojkic et al . , 2016 ) . Based on these observations , we proposed a revised model for engulfment membrane migration in which coordinated PG synthesis and degradation at the leading edge of the engulfing mother cell membrane moves the junction between the septum and the lateral cell wall around the forespore , making room for the engulfing membrane to advance ( Figure 1B; Ojkic et al . , 2016 ) . This model eliminates the need for complete dissolution of the septal PG and predicts that PG synthesis happens ahead of the leading edge of the engulfing membrane . Then , the mother cell DMP degrades this new PG to mediate membrane migration . However , due to the limited resolution of optical microscopy , conclusive evidence that PG synthesis occurs ahead of PG degradation is lacking . Cryo-ET allows the visualization of three-dimensional ( 3D ) architecture of bacterial membranes and cell wall in a hydrated near-native state that cannot be achieved by methods reliant on chemical fixation and staining ( Ben-Harush et al . , 2010; Matias and Beveridge , 2005; Oikonomou et al . , 2016 ) . However , a limitation of cryo-ET is that the samples must be less than ~500 nm thick to obtain high-resolution tomograms , constraining its application to only a handful of bacteria that are either naturally slender , or , as in the case of B . subtilis , for which slender mutant strains are available ( Tocheva et al . , 2013 ) . But the latter typically contain mutations in genes involved in PG metabolism and may not be ideal to study cell wall remodeling . Recent application of cryo-focused ion beam ( cryo-FIB ) milling has produced artifact-free thin sample sections of ~100–300 nm , which allows the acquisition of high-resolution tomograms of sections of wild type cells ( Figure 1C; Marko et al . , 2007; Rigort et al . , 2012; Villa et al . , 2013 ) . Cryo-FIB milling coupled with cryo-ET ( or cryo-FIB-ET ) is therefore becoming the method of choice for studies of cellular architecture of both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells ( Chaikeeratisak et al . , 2017; Engel et al . , 2015; Lopez-Garrido et al . , 2018; Mahamid et al . , 2016 ) . Here , we have used cryo-FIB-ET to study sporulation in B . subtilis , revealing the different stages of engulfment with a resolution that has not been achieved previously . We have analyzed wild type sporangia , engulfment mutants , and sporangia treated with PG synthesis inhibitors to obtain new mechanistic insights into the PG transformations that occur during engulfment . First , we provide evidence that septal PG is not degraded completely at the onset of engulfment . Second , we show that during membrane migration , the newly synthesized PG deforms the forespore membrane ahead of the leading edge of the engulfing mother cell membrane , indicating that PG synthesis precedes PG degradation . Third , we observe that the mother cell membrane migrates around the forespore by forming tiny finger-like projections , the formation of which depends on DMP complexes tethering to and degrading the PG ahead of the engulfing membrane . The methodology , images and analyses presented here will provide valuable resources for future studies of spore assembly and other fundamental cell biological processes . 2 Results Recently , we used cryo-FIB-ET to illustrate the role of DNA translocation in inflating the forespore ( Lopez-Garrido et al . , 2018 ) . These data confirmed the presence of a thin layer of PG between the forespore and the mother cell membranes in the wild type strain , as previously visualized by cryo-ET of a slender ponA mutant of B . subtilis ( Tocheva et al . , 2013 ) . We expanded our cryo-FIB-ET studies to investigate the architecture of B . subtilis cells during different stages of sporulation ( Figure 1C; see Materials and methods ) . We acquired high-quality data of wild type cells during engulfment ( Stage II , Figure 1D–I; Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) and during later stages of sporulation , when cortex and coat were being assembled ( Stages III-VI , Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ) . Data of very late stages of sporulation failed to provide high-resolution information inside the forespore , likely due to the dehydration of this cell , which increases sensitivity of cryo-ET samples to the electron beam ( Wu et al . , 2012 ) . Our data showed that the external cell wall of sporulating cells was ~20–30 nm thick , consistent with other EM studies ( Matias and Beveridge , 2005; Tocheva et al . , 2013 ) . The polar septum formed close ( within 500 nm ) to one cell pole , and was initially flat ( Figure 1D , E , Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–D , Video 1 ) . Eventually , the septum bent smoothly into the mother cell ( Figure 1F , G , Figure 1—figure supplement 1E–H , Video 2 ) and the mother cell membrane moved forward to engulf the forespore , at which stage the forespore was roughly rounded ( Figure 1H , I , Figure 1—figure supplement 1I–L , Video 3 ) . Visual inspection of tomograms also revealed several structures that have not been characterized previously . Immediately after polar septation , we observed ellipsoidal complexes that were present only in the forespore , adjacent to the membrane and often close to the intersection between the septum and the lateral cell wall ( Figure 1J , Figure 1—figure supplement 3A–C ) . These structures were observed in 2 out of 7 tomograms of wild type sporangia with flat septa , with ~4 ellipsoidal complexes observed in ~200 nm slices . The 3D reconstruction of these complexes revealed that the ellipsoidal structures had a mean radius of ~45 nm ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3A–C , see Materials and methods ) . The molecular identity of these structures remains undetermined . We also identified a region approximately in the center of a flat septum where the two membranes are closer together than elsewhere on the septum ( 14 nm vs . 23 nm , Figure 1K , Figure 1—figure supplement 3D , E ) . This constriction may correspond to paired hexameric SpoIIIE channels ( Fleming et al . , 2010; Liu et al . , 2006; Yen Shin et al . , 2015 ) . We also observed structures that appear to be channels crossing the septum ( Figure 1L ) that may correspond to SpoIIIA-SpoIIQ complexes ( Blaylock et al . , 2004; Levdikov et al . , 2012; Morlot and Rodrigues , 2018; Zeytuni et al . , 2017 ) . We observed this thin region in the polar septum and channel-like features ( Figure 1K , L ) in 2 out of 15 tomograms of wild type sporangia with flat and curved septa . The low frequency of observation could be attributed to the fact that we are imaging only ~150–250 nm slices of cells that are over 1 μm wide . So , many tomograms would not include low abundance structures such as SpoIIIE , which is comprised of two adjacent channels . Next , we observed a basement coat layer adjacent to the outer forespore membrane that is likely comprised of SpoVM and/or SpoIVA ( Figure 1M; Ramamurthi and Losick , 2009 ) . This layer is visible as an array of dots spaced ~4–6 nm apart , similar to that observed previously in Acetonema longum sporulating cells ( Tocheva et al . , 2011 ) . Moving outward , we observed a dense amorphous layer and a filamentous layer ( Figure 1L–N , Figure 1—figure supplement 3F , G ) that may contain CotE , SpoIVA and other coat proteins that are recruited to the outer forespore membrane during engulfment ( McKenney et al . , 2013 ) . Further studies are required to determine the molecular identity of these structures unambiguously . The cryo-FIB-ET images provided high-resolution details of the septum and the engulfing membrane . Hence , we focused on those details to obtain mechanistic insights about engulfment . The complete degradation of the septal PG during septal thinning has been traditionally considered a prerequisite for engulfment ( Abanes-De Mello et al . , 2002; Chastanet and Losick , 2007; Eichenberger et al . , 2001; Perez et al . , 2000 ) . However , we observed a thin PG layer between the mother cell and the forespore membranes throughout engulfment in both wild type ( Figure 2A; Lopez-Garrido et al . , 2018 ) and a slender ponA mutant ( Tocheva et al . , 2013 ) , suggesting that the septal PG is either not completely degraded or is quickly resynthesized after degradation . To probe this , we imaged engulfing sporangia after treatment with antibiotics that block PG synthesis . When PG synthesis is inhibited , engulfment membrane migration does not continue , although the septum still stretches and curves into the mother cell ( Ojkic et al . , 2016 ) . We reasoned that , if the septal PG was completely degraded , we would observe sporangia lacking PG between the mother cell and the forespore membranes after antibiotic treatment . However , if the septal PG was not completely degraded , the sporangia would show a layer of PG around the forespore , independent of antibiotic treatment . To inhibit PG synthesis , we treated the cells with bacitracin , cephalexin , penicillin V or a combination of penicillin V and cephalexin ( Figure 2 ) . We previously assessed the extent of PG inhibition after antibiotic treatment by determining the frequency of division events , which rely on the synthesis of new PG ( Ojkic et al . , 2016 ) . As expected , our results showed that untreated cells continued to grow and divide under the experimental conditions ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1A ) but when treated with cephalexin and penicillin V , cell division was completely blocked . These results also indicated that PG synthesis was inhibited within a few minutes of antibiotic treatment , because cells that were already undergoing septation were unable to complete septum formation ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–D , top panels ) . To complement this analysis , we tested if these drugs also inhibited elongation , which also depends on PG synthesis ( Spratt , 1975 ) . To do so , we measured the elongation of vegetative cells present in sporulating cultures over a period of one hour after antibiotic treatment ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1E , see Materials and methods ) . The length of wild type untreated vegetative cells increased by ~35% in an hour , but when treated with cephalexin or penicillin V alone , they elongated only ~10% . Furthermore , when treated with a combination of cephalexin and penicillin V , the cells elongated negligibly , indicating complete blockage of both septation and elongation ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 , Videos 4–7 ) . For cryo-FIB-ET , we added the antibiotics two hours after inducing sporulation , when ~ 40–50% of the cells have undergone polar septation ( Ojkic et al . , 2016 ) , and plunge froze the samples either one ( for bacitracin ) or two hours ( for cephalexin , penicillin V , and combination of cephalexin and penicillin V ) later . Indeed , we observed a thin PG layer in both untreated and antibiotic-treated sporangia ( Figure 2 , Figure 2—figure supplement 2 ) , suggesting that septal PG is not completely degraded at the onset of engulfment . The above observation prompted us to re-evaluate the process of septal thinning . The current model for septal thinning proposes that DMP initially localizes to the septal midpoint , where it starts degrading the septal PG as it moves towards the edge of the septal disk ( Abanes-De Mello et al . , 2002; Chastanet and Losick , 2007; Illing and Errington , 1991; Meyer et al . , 2010 ) . This enzymatic septal thinning model predicts that , during the transition from flat to curved septa , the septum should be thinner in the middle than at the edges ( Figure 3A ) . To test this , we measured the distance between the forespore and the mother cell membranes across the length of the septum ( see Materials and methods ) for cells with flat ( Stage IIi ) , curved ( Stage IIii ) and engulfing ( Stage IIiii ) septa ( Figure 3B–D , Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) . Sporangia with flat septa had an average septal thickness of ~23 nm±3 . 3 nm ( Figure 3B , E , F ) with 3 out of 5 septa being thicker at the middle ( ~28 nm ) than at the edges ( ~22 nm ) ( Figure 3B , E , Figure 3—figure supplement 1A ) , contrary to what is proposed by the enzymatic septal thinning model . The septal thickness decreased by ~25% to~18 nm during later stages of engulfment ( Figure 3C–F , Figure 3—figure supplement 1B , C ) and a thin layer of PG was observed in all septa ( Figure 2A , Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–C ) . Importantly , septal thickness was uniform across the entire septum during later stages ( Figure 3C , D , E , Figure 3—figure supplement 1B , C ) and no septum was thinner in the middle than in the edges . These results show that the transition from thick to thin septum is homogenous , contrary to the prediction of the enzymatic septal thinning model , and consistent with the model that DNA translocation dependent forespore growth stretches septal PG . Next , we tested whether DMP was required to mediate the slight thinning observed during the transition from flat to curved septum . To address this question , we measured septal thickness in DMP mutants . In single mutants lacking D , M or P , engulfment is blocked but the septum bulges towards the mother cell , which complicates the analysis ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2 ) . However , bulge formation is largely abolished in a triple mutant lacking functional versions of D , M and P simultaneously ( Eichenberger et al . , 2001 ) . Therefore , we imaged the DMP triple mutant by cryo-FIB-ET and measured its septal thickness ( Figure 3G–I , Figure 3—figure supplement 3 ) . Most sporulation septa of the DMP triple mutant were either flat or slightly curved into the mother cell ( Figure 3G–I , Figure 3—figure supplement 3A–D ) . In some cells , we observed membrane accumulation in the mother cell ( Figure 3H , I , Figure 3—figure supplement 3A , B ) and small bulges approximately in the middle of the septum ( Figure 3—figure supplement 3C , D , Video 8 ) . Septal thickness ranged from ~25 nm to ~45 nm , with an average thickness of 28 nm ±2 . 09 nm ( Figure 3E–G , Figure 3—figure supplement 3E ) , which is ~5 nm greater than that of wild type sporangia with flat septa . Importantly , there were no significant differences in septal thickness between flat and curved septa in DMP mutant sporangia ( Figure 3G , Figure 3—figure supplement 3E ) , indicating that DMP is in fact necessary for the slight thinning of the septum observed in wild type sporangia . Surprisingly , the thickness of individual DMP mutant septum was irregular across the septal length , with thicker regions of more than 45 nm , that were not observed in wild type cells ( Figure 3G , Figure 3—figure supplement 3E ) . One possible explanation for this finding is that in the absence of DMP , proteins involved in PG synthesis persist at the septum , and their continued activity leads to thicker and less flexible septal regions ( Figure 3J ) . To test this model , we stained wild type and DMP mutant sporangia with BOCILLIN-FL , a fluorescent-derivative of penicillin V with affinity for multiple penicillin-binding proteins ( PBPs ) ( Zhao et al . , 1999 , see Materials and methods ) . We observed continuous fluorescent signal around the septa in both strains , but the signal was brightest at the leading edge in wild type sporangia ( Ojkic et al . , 2016 ) and at different positions across the septum in DMP mutant sporangia ( Figure 3—figure supplement 4 ) . This mislocalization might allow ongoing synthesis of septal PG , leading to abnormally thick sporulation septa . Once the septum curves , the mother cell membrane starts to migrate around the forespore . Since the PG is not completely degraded , it will represent a major obstacle for the advancement of the engulfing membrane . To explain how cells overcome this hurdle , we previously proposed a conceptually new model for engulfment in which coordinated PG synthesis and degradation at the leading edge of the engulfing membrane moves the junction between the septum and the lateral cell wall around the forespore , making room for the engulfing mother cell membrane to advance ( Figure 1B; Ojkic et al . , 2016 ) . In this ‘make before break’ model , new PG would be synthesized ahead of the engulfing membrane by forespore-associated PG biosynthetic complexes and subsequently degraded by DMP . To test this model , we first focused on the shape of the forespore membrane opposing the leading edge of the engulfing mother cell membrane . In wild type sporangia , the forespore membrane was rounded immediately ahead of the engulfing membrane ( Figure 4A ) . This could be due to accumulation of additional PG at this site , which might push and deform the forespore membrane , introducing a broader curve . To confirm this , we analyzed the shape of the forespore membrane of sporangia in which PG synthesis was blocked with either bacitracin or cephalexin ( Figure 4B , Figure 4—figure supplement 1 , see Materials and methods ) . The forespore membrane was less rounded and had a sharp corner with a radius of curvature that was four times smaller than that of untreated cells ( ~30 nm vs . ~120 nm , Figure 4C ) . These results indicate that new PG is indeed synthesized ahead of the leading edge of the engulfing membrane , and that it deforms the forespore membrane at the junction between the septum and the lateral cell wall . To exclude the possibility that new PG synthesis also happened behind the leading edge of the engulfing membrane , we analyzed septal thickness in sporangia treated with cephalexin and a combination of cephalexin and penicillin V using cryo-FIB-ET . If the septum is thinner in the presence of antibiotics , it would suggest that additional septal PG is synthesized after the DMP complex advances and degrades the PG ahead of the leading edge of the engulfing membrane . However , if septal thickness is independent of the presence of antibiotics , it would suggest that PG is not normally synthesized behind the DMP complex . Our data showed that the septal thickness of cells treated with cephalexin was comparable to that of untreated cells . Surprisingly , the septal thickness of cells treated with a combination of cephalexin and penicillin V was ~3 nm greater than that of untreated cells ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2 ) . This modest increase in septal thickness is of a magnitude that is consistent with recent molecular dynamics simulations which show that relaxed PG is thicker than stretched PG ( Beeby et al . , 2013 ) . It is possible that treatment with antibiotics blocking PG synthesis inhibits the stretching of septal PG due to the absence of membrane migration which could pull the septal PG around the forespore . Alternatively , the residual DMP might partially cleave septal PG , releasing the tension and leading to slightly thicker septa . Taken together , in both cases of antibiotic treatment the septal thickness did not decrease compared to untreated sporangia , suggesting that PG is not synthesized behind the DMP complex . The new PG synthesized ahead of the leading edge of the engulfing membrane might interfere with the movement of the engulfing membrane , until it is degraded by DMP . To obtain insights about the movement of the engulfing membrane , we annotated the forespore and the mother cell membranes in our tomograms to visualize the architecture of the leading edge in 3D . Our data showed that the leading edge of the engulfing membrane in wild type sporulating cells moved around the forespore in tiny finger-like projections ( Figure 4D–G , Figure 4—figure supplement 3 ) . The projections were ~10–30 nm wide and ~5–20 nm long , with significant variations from cell to cell . We hypothesized that those projections could be due to the uneven degradation of PG ahead of the leading edge of the engulfing membrane . To test this possibility , we imaged spoIIP mutant sporangia , which lack a functional DMP complex . As expected , the septum bulged towards the mother cell cytoplasm , but the mother cell membrane did not move forward in these cells . No membrane projections anywhere were observed in the mother cell membrane in any of the tomograms that were annotated ( Figure 4H–K , Figure 4—figure supplement 4 , Video 9 ) . Also , no projections were observed in the DMP triple mutant , most of which did not form bulges ( Figure 4—figure supplement 5 ) . These findings suggest that SpoIIDMP is necessary for the formation of finger-like projections in the engulfing mother cell membrane . We next tested whether PG synthesis was also required for the formation of finger-like projections . To study this possibility , we focused on sporangia in which PG synthesis was blocked using cephalexin ( Figure 4L–O , Video 10 ) . When treated with antibiotics that block PG synthesis , membrane migration is blocked although the forespore continues to grow into the mother cell ( Ojkic et al . , 2016 ) . The case of cephalexin-treated cells is more complicated than other antibiotics , because after the septum curves into the mother cell , the leading edge sometimes retracts on one side while advancing slightly on the other ( Video 10; Ojkic et al . , 2016 ) . This appears to consist of rotation of the ‘cup’ formed by the bulging septum relative to the lateral cell wall , rather than membrane migration , because the distance between the leading edges does not decrease during this process . Thus , rotation of the septal cup does not reflect the degree to which the forespore is engulfed . Cephalexin inhibits the earliest stages of cell division ( Eberhardt et al . , 2003; Kocaoglu and Carlson , 2015 ) , and therefore we speculate that it might be required to tether the extending septum to the lateral cell wall . In the absence of these bridges , the septum might be free to rotate according to Brownian motion , perhaps anchored by the Q-AH ratchet that can also mediate engulfment in the absence of the cell wall ( Broder and Pogliano , 2006 ) . We used cryo-FIB-ET to compare the architecture of both sides of the engulfing membrane in cephalexin-treated sporangia ( Figure 4L–O ) . We did not observe finger-like projections in the side of the membrane that retracts ( Figure 4M ) but observed a few projections in the opposite side ( Figure 4N ) , which might remain tethered to PG ahead of the engulfing membrane . Also , when cells were treated with penicillin V , we observed fewer projections that were shorter compared to untreated cells ( Figure 4—figure supplement 6 ) . Taken together , these results suggest that the finger-like projections at the leading edge of the engulfing membrane might be caused by tethering of the engulfing membrane to the PG via DMP ( Figure 4P ) . 3 Discussion In this study , we have visualized the developmental process of sporulation in Bacillus subtilis using cryo-FIB-ET . We have obtained images of cells during different stages of sporulation at a resolution of a few nanometers , revealing new details about the architecture of spore assembly , as well as several hitherto unknown structures inside and around the developing spore ( Figure 1 ) . Our results also provide mechanistic insights into engulfment , including the early step of septal thinning ( Figures 2 and 3 ) and membrane migration ( Figure 4 ) which are captured in the model presented in Figure 5 . We provide evidence that the septal PG is not completely degraded at the onset of engulfment . Instead , the septum gets slightly ( ~25% ) thinner as it curves into the mother cell , with PG continuously present between the mother cell and the forespore membranes . In addition , the whole septum transitions from thick to thin homogenously , contrary to previous results that suggested that septal thinning started in the middle and progressed towards the edges . The homogenous thinning of the septum can be explained by our previous finding that septal PG is stretched as the forespore grows towards the mother cell due to increased turgor pressure caused by SpoIIIE-mediated chromosome translocation ( Lopez-Garrido et al . , 2018 ) . Thus , septal thinning could simply represent a change in the conformation of the septal PG , from a relaxed to a stretched state , triggered by the increased turgor pressure in the forespore . This is consistent with recent molecular dynamics simulations on Gram-positive cell walls , which show that relaxed PG fragments are ~25% thicker than those in a strained conformation ( Beeby et al . , 2013 ) . Our results also indicate that DMP is required to maintain a flexible septum that can curve as the forespore grows into the mother cell ( Figure 3 ) . We found that the septa of DMP triple mutants have irregular thickness and are on average thicker than wild type septa ( Figure 3E–G ) . Since DMP is produced after polar septation , the septa of DMP mutant sporangia must have thickened after they have been formed . Thus , it is possible that DMP prevents septal thickening by clearing PG synthases from the septum , where they would accumulate after polar septation . This model is consistent with the increased localization of PBPs throughout the septum in DMP mutants ( Figure 3—figure supplement 4 ) . Nevertheless , we cannot rule out the possibility that DMP degrades the septal PG partially to generate a flexible septum . If this was the case , the partial degradation should happen simultaneously across the whole septum to enable the homogenous transition from thick to thin . However , since DMP is rate limiting for engulfment , it seems unlikely that there may be enough DMP complexes to mediate the homogeneous thinning of the septum . We therefore favor the model that septal thinning is primarily driven by stretching of septal peptidoglycan . Our data also provide insights into the mechanism of membrane migration during engulfment . Using fluorescence microscopy , we previously observed that new PG is synthesized at the leading edge of the engulfing membrane ( Ojkic et al . , 2016; Tocheva et al . , 2013 ) . We also showed that many forespore penicillin binding proteins ( PBPs ) can track the leading edge of the engulfing mother cell membrane ( Ojkic et al . , 2016 ) , suggesting that PG synthesis at the leading edge of the engulfing membrane is carried out by forespore PBPs . The cryo-FIB-ET images presented here provide further support to this idea: the comparison of the architecture of the leading edge of the engulfing membrane between native sporangia and sporangia in which PG synthesis is blocked by antibiotics shows that new PG deforms and rounds the forespore membrane ahead of the leading edge of the engulfing membrane ( Figure 4A–C ) , indicating that new PG is synthesized by forespore PBPs immediately ahead of the leading edge of the engulfing mother cell membrane . We propose that DMP complexes at the leading edge of the engulfing membrane target this new PG for degradation , making room for the engulfing membrane to advance ( Figures 1B and 5C ) . This relatively simple model suggests that engulfment could have evolved by developing new mechanisms to spatially and temporally regulate the conserved protein machineries that synthesize and degrade peptidoglycan . The 3D reconstruction of the leading edge of the engulfing mother cell membrane shows the presence of finger-like projections that resemble the filopodia of eukaryotic cells ( Mattila and Lappalainen , 2008 ) . In eukaryotic cells , these membrane projections are produced by cytoskeletal proteins , and the projections are typically a few micrometers wide . In contrast , no cytoskeletal elements contributing to engulfment have been described so far ( or visualized in our tomograms ) and the finger-like projections at the leading edge of the engulfing membrane are only a few nanometers wide . Instead , our results demonstrate that DMP is required for the formation of these finger-like projections . The simplest model to explain these data is that DMP tethers the engulfing membrane to the PG ahead of the leading edge of the engulfing membrane , as it degrades the new PG to make room for the engulfing membrane to expand . DMP activity is rate limiting for membrane migration ( Abanes-De Mello et al . , 2002; Meyer et al . , 2010 ) , suggesting that there is a discrete number of DMP complexes to remove the steric barrier posed by the newly synthesized PG ahead of the leading edge . The limited number of DMP complexes might cause the PG to be degraded irregularly , generating an uneven membrane front in the form of finger-like projections . The distance between the tips of the finger-like projections is ~5–20 nm , which would require that some DMP complexes are ahead of others by 2 to 8 glycan strands ( Turner et al . , 2018 ) . Our observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the finger-like projections are produced via the tethering of the DMP complex to existing peptidoglycan , since short fingers are observed when PG synthesis is inhibited , and that these fingers are either stabilized or enhanced by binding newly synthesized peptidoglycan , since longer fingers are observed in the presence of ongoing PG synthesis . This is supported by prior studies of the two enzymes that degrade peptidoglycan ( D and P ) , which have shown that these comprise a processive enzyme complex in which P binds and cleaves PG first , allowing D to bind and cleave PG ( Morlot et al . , 2010 ) . Our cell biological data showed that localization of P to the leading edge of the engulfing membrane is decreased but not completely absent when PG synthesis is inhibited ( Ojkic et al . , 2016 ) , suggesting that P can bind to existing PG , but that high affinity binding requires newly synthesized peptidoglycan . This increased binding of P would likely allow the formation of longer finger-like projections . From a functional perspective , we speculate that the finger-like projections could be compared to ‘friction ridges’ , the minutely raised ridges of the epidermis that provide a grasping surface on our fingers ( Tomlinson et al . , 2007 ) . During engulfment , these membrane projections may provide the engulfing membrane a tighter lateral grip while moving around the forespore , hence serving as a ratchet that prevents backward movement of the membrane . The application of cryo-FIB-ET has been instrumental in allowing us to visualize and accurately measure structural details of engulfing sporangia , which transpire at a scale of a few nanometers . Our studies support a mechanistic model for the enigmatic process of engulfment , while revealing novel architectural details about engulfment and spore assembly , including intriguing new molecular structures that will require further study to unambiguously identify them . Our findings reveal details about sporulation at an unprecedented resolution and further illustrate the potential of cryo-FIB-ET to reveal critical new information about dynamic biological processes . 4 Materials and methods We used Bacillus subtilis PY79 background for all data acquisition . The strains ( see Key Resources Table ) were grown in LB plates at 30°C . The bacteria were first grown in ¼ diluted LB to OD600 ~0 . 5–0 . 7 . Sporulation was then induced by resuspension in A + B media at 37°C . For cryo-FIB-ET , we collected wild type sporulating cells 1 . 5–3 hr after sporulation induction . For cells treated with antibiotics , 50 μg/ml of bacitracin , 50 μg/ml of cephalexin and 500 μg/ml of penicillin V were used . Antibiotics were added two hours after induction of sporulation and samples for cryo-FIB-ET were collected either one ( for bacitracin ) or two hours ( for cephalexin , penicillin V and a combination of cephalexin and penicillin V ) later . For spoIIP and spoIIDMP mutant sporangia , cells were collected 2 . 5 hr after induction of sporulation for cryo-ET . 7 μl of diluted liquid culture was deposited onto glow-discharged ( using Pelco easyGlow ) holey carbon coated QUANTIFOIL R 2/1 200 mesh copper grids . Manual blotting was performed using Whatman No . one filter paper from the reverse side to remove excess resuspension media such that cells form a monolayer on the grids . They were then immediately plunge-frozen into a liquid ethane/propane mixture cooled by liquid nitrogen using a custom-built vitrification device ( Max Planck Institute for Biochemistry , Munich ) . These grids were then stored in storage boxes in liquid nitrogen until further use . Vitrified bacterial samples forming a monolayer on the grids were mounted into modified autogrids ( Max Planck Institute for Biochemistry ) for milling inside a Thermo Scientific Scios DualBeam ( cryo-FIB/SEM ) ( Materials and methods ) . 100–250 nm thin sections or lamellae ( 12–15 μm in width ) were then prepared using rectangular milling patterns and beam current of 0 . 1 nA or 0 . 3 nA for rough milling and 10 pA or 30 pA for fine milling as described in Chaikeeratisak et al . ( 2017 ) . Tilt series were collected in a 300-keV Tecnai G2 Polara ( Thermo Scientific ) equipped with a K2 Summit direct detection camera ( Gatan ) and a post-column Quantum energy filter ( Gatan ) . The samples were usually tilted from −66° to +66° ( the range per tilt series depending on the quality of the lamellae ) with an increment of 1 . 5° or 2° . The tilt series were acquired using SerialEM ( Mastronarde , 2005 ) . The images were recorded at a defocus of −5 to −6 μm at nominal magnifications of 34 , 000 ( pixel size: 0 . 61 nm ) or 41 , 000 ( pixel size: 0 . 49 nm ) with a cumulative dose of ~60–130 e-/Å2 . Images for later stages of sporulation ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2B ) were acquired at nominal magnification of 22 , 500 ( pixel size: 0 . 92 nm ) as these samples were highly sensitive to radiation damage . The patch-tracking feature of IMOD was used to reconstruct the tilt-series ( Kremer et al . , 1996 ) . TomosegmemTV ( Martinez-Sanchez et al . , 2014 ) was used for semi-automatic segmentation of membranes followed by manual refinement in the Amira software package . The mean radius ( r ) of an ellipse is given by:r= a2+ b22where a is the semi-major axis of the ellipse and b is the semi-minor axis of the ellipse . For ellipsoidal complexes observed in our tomograms ( Figure 1J , Figure 1—figure supplement 3A–C ) , average value of a is ~45 nm and that of b is ~42 nm . ‘Surface distance’ feature of Amira was used to calculate the septal distances between the forespore and mother cell membranes . The septal-disc was color coded according to these values ( Figure 3B–D , G , Figure 3—figure supplement 2E ) . Five tomograms each of wild type cells representing different stages of engulfment ( flat , curved and engulfing septa ) were used for analysis . For engulfment mutants , five spoIIP sporangia and seven spoIIDMP sporangia were analyzed . For antibiotic treated cells , six cephalexin-treated sporangia and five cephalexin- and penicillin V- combination treated sporangia were analyzed . To get the linear profiles of the distances , the data was grouped into smaller bins of approximately equal area for each tomogram . Then the average of the distance within a bin was used to represent the distance between the membranes at that location of the bin ( see Source code 1 ) . Figure 3E represents an average of all the profiles for each cell type in Figure 3—figure supplement 1 and Figure 3—figure supplement 3E . Cells were visualized on an Applied Precision DV Elite optical sectioning microscope equipped with a Photometrics CoolSNAP-HQ2 camera and deconvolved using SoftWoRx v5 . 5 . 1 ( Applied Precision ) . For experiment outlined in Figure 3—figure supplement 4 , the median focal plane of the image is shown . Membranes were stained with 0 . 5 μg/ml of FM4-64 ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) that was added directly to 1 . 2% agarose pads prepared using sporulation resuspension medium . 10 μg/μl of BOCILLIN-FL was added to 1 ml of culture aliquoted ~2 . 5 hr after sporulation induction ( at 37°C ) and washed with sporulation resuspension medium three times . 12 μl of washed cells were then transferred to agarose pads for imaging . For time-lapse microscopy , sporulation was induced at 30°C . 0 . 5 μg/ml FM4-64 was added to the cultures ~1 . 5 hr after sporulation induction and incubation continued for another hour . Composition of agarose pads for time-lapse microscopy is as follows: 2/3 vol of supernatant from the sporulation culture , 1/3 vol 3 . 6% agarose in fresh A + B sporulation medium , 0 . 17 μg/ml FM4-64 , supplemented with antibiotics according to concentrations mentioned above in ‘Strains and culture conditions’ . 12 μl samples were taken 3 hr after resuspension and transferred to the agarose pads . Pads were covered with a glass slide and sealed with petroleum jelly to avoid dehydration during time-lapse imaging . Pictures were taken in an environmental chamber at 30°C every 5 min for ~5 hr . Excitation/emission filters were TRITC/CY5 for membrane imaging . Excitation light transmission was set to 5% to minimize phototoxicity and exposure time was set to 0 . 1 s . To determine the length of vegetative cells over time ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1E ) , membrane contours were extracted from microscopy images for each time frame ( up to 60 min post treatment with antibiotics ) using semi-automated active contour software JFilament , available as a Fiji plugin ( Schindelin et al . , 2012; Smith et al . , 2010 ) . The cell length was then calculated by measuring along the long axis of the contours using a custom-built MATLAB script ( see Source code 2 ) . To plot the average cell length , the data was normalized to the initial cell length for each of the cases . To calculate radius of curvature ( Figure 4A–C , Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) , a slice was taken approximately from the center of the z-stack for each of the tomograms . ‘Measure spline curvature’ feature of sabl_mpl ( Yao et al . , 2017 ) was then used to plot radii of curvatures around the forespore membranes just ahead of the leading edge for seven native sporangia and five antibiotic-treated sporangia wherein membrane migration appears to be blocked ."}

Yet signals from outside of the cell can still influence how that cell behaves . One way this can happen is via small molecules called ligands binding to proteins embedded in the membrane and triggering a cascade of reactions inside the cell . Studying this kind of protein-ligand interaction is important for many aspects of biology . However , such studies typically require that the ligand be first labeled in some way , which is time-consuming , costly and may alter how the ligand behaves . As such , there is a need for alternative ways to measure ligands binding to proteins in membranes .

The two hallmarks of electrophysiological recordings are high sensitivity and high temporal resolution: it is technically feasible to monitor currents through single molecules and to resolve conformational transitions , which occur on the microsecond scale . In addition , voltage-clamp recordings also allow for determining the cell membrane capacitance ( CM ) . Using this approach , it has been possible to detect changes in membrane area that result from the fusion of a single vesicle with the plasma membrane ( Neher and Marty , 1982; Fernandez et al . , 1984; von Gersdorff and Matthews , 1994 ) . However , a change in membrane area is not the only factor that can affect capacitance . Several studies – most of them conducted in cells that overexpressed a membrane protein – demonstrated the contribution of the same to the CM: the effect can be accounted for by mobile charges within the protein . These add to the total charge required to recharge the membrane upon prior voltage change . Voltage-gated channels were the first membrane proteins on which capacitance measurements were conducted: the total CM of a cell expressing these proteins was shown to comprise a voltage-independent component , which was ascribed to the membrane , and a voltage-dependent component , which was attributed to mobile charges within the voltage sensors of the channel ( Bean and Rios , 1989 ) . However , capacitance measurements also allow for extracting information on the conformational switch associated with binding of ions and/or substrate to transporters: it has , for instance , been possible to infer the conformational transition associated with phosphorylation of the Na+/K+-pump from the recorded change in capacitance ( Lu et al . , 1995 ) . Similarly , binding of the co-substrate Cl- to the inward-facing conformation of the γ-aminobutyric acid transporter-1 ( GAT1/SLC6A1 ) caused a very rapid reduction in the recorded capacitance , which was proposed to reflect the suppression of a charge moving reaction induced by binding of Na+ to the outward -facing conformation of GAT1 . In the present study , we conducted current and capacitance measurements in HEK293 cells expressing human SERT . Like GAT1 , SERT is a member of the solute carrier 6 ( SCL6 ) family . The transport cycle of SERT is understood in considerable detail ( Schicker et al . , 2012; Sandtner et al . , 2014 ) , in particular the nature of substrate-induced currents , electrogenic steps associated with binding and release of co-substrate ions and decision points in the transport cycle ( Hasenhuetl et al . , 2016; Kern et al . , 2017 ) . In addition SERT , in contrast to GAT1 , has a very rich pharmacology ( Sitte and Freissmuth , 2015 ) , which allows for probing the actions of inhibitors ( Hasenhuetl et al . , 2015 ) , atypical inhibitors ( Sandtner et al . , 2016 ) , substrates and releasers ( Sandtner et al . , 2014; Kern et al . , 2017 ) , and atypical substrates/partial releasers ( Bhat et al . , 2017 ) by electrophysiological recordings . Here we explored changes in apparent CM resulting from ligand binding to SERT . A reduction in CM was seen regardless of whether the ligand was the cognate substrate or an inhibitor of SERT , e . g . cocaine . The Gouy-Chapman model ( Gouy , 1909; Chapman , 1913 ) predicts that charged ligand adsorption to membrane proteins must result in an apparent change of the CM and in ligand-induced displacement currents . We verified these predictions , by analysing both the ligand-induced currents and the related changes in CM . 2 Results When measured in the whole cell configuration , rapid application of 5-HT to SERT gives rise to an initial peak current , which is followed by a steady-state current ( Schicker et al . , 2012 ) . The peak current is caused by a synchronized conformational rearrangement that carries 5-HT through the membrane ( Hasenhuetl et al . , 2016 ) . The steady-state current on the other hand is contingent on the progression of SERT through the transport cycle . Raising intracellular Na+ impedes this cycle and eliminates the steady-state current ( Hasenhuetl et al . , 2015 ) . This allows for studying the peak current in isolation as shown in the upper panel of Figure 1A , which depicts a representative trace elicited by 30 µM 5-HT in the presence of 152 mM intracellular Na+ . We applied 100 µM cocaine to a cell expressing SERT to explore whether inhibitors of SERT also caused conformational rearrangements detectable by electrophysiological recordings . The recording in the lower panel of Figure 1A shows a cocaine-induced current , which was smaller than that elicited by 5-HT and which was absent in control cells ( data not shown ) : In paired measurement , where cells were challenged with both 30 µM 5-HT and 100 µM cocaine ( Figure 1B ) , we observed a constant amplitude ratio ( 5-HT: cocaine ~4:1 ) . The KD for cocaine binding to SERT has been estimated by radioligand binding assays , by the concentration dependence of its inhibitory action on substrate uptake and by electrophysiological means ( Hasenhuetl et al . , 2015 ) . The affinity estimates provided by these measurements range from 100 nM to 3 µM ( Han and Gu , 2006; Hasenhuetl et al . , 2015 ) . These concentrations are much lower than the 100 µM used in the above experiments . Accordingly , we measured the current in response to a wide range of cocaine concentrations ( Figure 1C ) . It is evident from these recordings that an increase in cocaine concentration was associated with larger amplitudes and accelerated peak current decays . The time courses of the decays were adequately fit by a monoexponential function . In Figure 1D , we plotted the rate estimates by the fits as a function of the applied cocaine concentration . The rates increased linearly over the tested concentration range . At concentrations below 10 µM , cocaine failed to evoke detectable currents . Binding of competitive inhibitors to SERT is dependent on Na+ ( Korkhov et al . , 2006 ) . Therefore , we measured the cocaine peak in the absence of extracellular Na+: at this condition , 100 µM cocaine failed to elicit a current ( Figure 1E ) . In contrast , when Cl- was removed from the extracellular solution , the cocaine-induced currents were present , but featured smaller amplitudes ( Figure 1F , G ) . We measured the voltage dependence of the cocaine-induced current by relying on the protocol depicted in the left panel of Figure 2A: the membrane was clamped for 1 min to a constant voltage ranging from −50 to +30 mV . During each successive voltage-clamp , 100 µM cocaine was applied for 5 s and subsequently removed to generate a family of currents ( right-hand panel of Figure 2A ) . Excessive noise precluded analysis above and below this voltage range . It is evident from Figure 2A that the cocaine peak became larger at positive potentials . The current-voltage relation was examined by averaging nine independent experiments after normalizing the current amplitudes to the current recorded at +30 mV: this current-voltage relation was linear over the explored voltage range and had a negative slope ( Figure 2B ) . It has long been known that extracellular Cl- is required for SERT-mediated substrate uptake ( Lingjaerde , 1971; Nelson and Rudnick , 1982 ) . However , the presence of Cl- is not required for 5-HT binding to SERT ( Nelson and Rudnick , 1982 ) . In fact , the absence of Cl- precludes the conversion of the substrate-loaded outward-facing transporter to the inward-facing conformation . Thus , in the following experiments , we removed Cl- from the extracellular solution to separate the event of 5-HT binding from the subsequent conformational change . Removal of Cl- reduced the peak amplitude and the area under the peak ( see Figure 3A for representative current traces and Figure 3B for the comparison of 20 independent experiments with paired recordings done in the presence and absence of Cl- ) . We also determined the current-voltage relation in the presence ( Figure 3C , D ) and absence of Cl- ( Figure 3E , F ) : in contrast to the positive slope seen in the presence of Cl- ( Figure 3C , D ) , the slope was negative in the absence of Cl- ( Figure 3E , F ) . These observations indicated that the absence of Cl- unmasked an event preceding the substrate-induced conformational change: this initial event had a small current amplitude and a negative slope in the current-voltage relationship . In contrast to 5-HT , which is the cognate substrate of SERT , cocaine is not translocated . Under our recording conditions , both compounds give rise to a transient current , which may arise by two alternative mechanisms: it is conceivable that binding of cocaine or of 5-HT to SERT occurs via an induced fit , that is local rearrangements are required within the vicinity of the binding pocket to accommodate the compound . These rearrangements can be expected to force charged residues of SERT to change their position within the membrane electric field . However , it is difficult to reconcile this with the negative slope in the current-voltage relation of both the cocaine- and the 5-HT-induced peak current in the absence of Cl- . The negative slope in the current-voltage relation was inconsistent with the conjecture that the cocaine-induced peak current originated from charges moving in the membrane electric field . The rules of electrostatics dictate that inwardly directed currents must increase at negative voltages , if they are carried by charges moving in response to a conformational change . This is also evident from the current-voltage relation for the 5-HT-induced peak current in the presence of chloride ( Figure 3C , D ) . This current reflects the conformational rearrangement that carries substrate and co-substrates through the membrane ( Hasenhuetl et al . , 2016 ) . Accordingly , the corresponding current-voltage relation had a positive slope ( Figure 3D ) . Alternative scenarios , which produce a negative slope , include a voltage-dependent gating step or a blockage of transport at negative potentials . These possibilities , however , can be discarded because cocaine is not transported , and thus there is no gating . Therefore , an alternative explanation is more plausible , if it can relate these currents to ligand binding without the need to invoke conformational changes: the Gouy-Chapman model provides a mathematical description of a simplified biological membrane ( see scheme in Figure 4A ) and allows for calculating the potentials at the inner and outer surface of the membrane . These potentials depend on the voltage difference between the intra- and extracellular bulk solution , the ionic composition of these solutions and the number of charges at the inner and outer membrane surfaces . In biological membranes , the charges at the surfaces comprise the phospholipid head groups and the solvent-accessible acidic or basic residues of membrane proteins . The number of charges at the surfaces is an important determinant of the transmembrane potential ( Φt ) , which represents the difference between the potentials at the opposite surfaces . We relied on the Gouy-Chapman model to test the hypothesis illustrated in the scheme shown in Figure 4A ( see also Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) using the following starting parameters: ( i ) in our stable cell line SERT is expressed at high levels; the number of SERT molecules was estimated in saturation binding experiments of [3H]imipramine and amounted to 2 ± 0 . 4 × 107 transporters/cell . Ligands of SERT including 5-HT and cocaine are positively charged . If all SERT moieties are saturated by stoichiometric binding ( one positively charged ligand/SERT ) , the charge density at the outer surface is expected to change by about ∆+0 . 0011 C/m2 . ( ii ) The total surface charge density on the outer surface of untransfected HEK293 cells is about −0 . 005 C/m2 ( Zhang et al . , 2001 ) . The ligand-induced change in outer surface charge density changes Фt by about – 10 mV ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) . Because the cell membrane represents a capacitor , this must result in a displacement current . Figure 4B depicts simulated displacement currents based on the voltage estimates provided by the model . The simulated currents are inwardly directed with amplitudes in the low picoampere range and thus match the observed currents . In Figure 4C , we modeled the concentration dependence of the cocaine-induced peak: it is implicit to our hypothesis that the time course of ligand-induced change in Φt must coincide with the time course of cocaine binding . We recently determined the association rate ( kon ) and dissociation rate ( koff ) of cocaine for SERT by an electrophysiological approach ( Hasenhuetl et al . , 2015 ) . These rates were used to calculate the apparent association rate ( kapp , dashed line in Figure 4D ) . At low cocaine concentrations , the simulated currents compared favorably with the observed . However , at higher cocaine concentrations the predictions deviated from the measured kapp ( red solid line in Figure 4D ) . We attribute this discrepancy to the fact that , at concentrations exceeding 30 µM , the solution exchange by our application device ( ~20 s−1 ) becomes rate-limiting; for technical reasons , the diffusion-limited association rate for cocaine is therefore currently inaccessible to an experimental determination . We applied a correction for the finite solution exchange rate ( see Material and methods ) . The corrected kapp is displayed in Figure 4D ( black solid line ) . We also calculated the current-voltage relation for the displacement current ( Figure 4E ) : consistent with our observations , the synthetic data predict larger currents at positive potentials . The hypothesis that charged ligand binding results in the generation of a displacement current therefore provides a parsimonious explanation for the negative slope of the observed current-voltage relation . The Gouy-Chapman model can be used to calculate the change in apparent CM resulting from ligand adsorption to the extracellular surface ( Figure 5A , see also Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) . This prediction was verified . Figure 5B shows a representative recording of the membrane capacitance ( CM ) with the two other circuit parameters RM and RS upon application and subsequent removal of 100 µM cocaine to HEK293 cells expressing SERT . It is evident from this recording that there was no cross talk between circuit parameters . This effect of cocaine on CM was absent in control cells ( Figure 5C ) . The reduction in CM by cocaine amounted to approx . 500 fF , which is in good agreement with the prediction ( Figure 5D ) . Figure 5E shows the concentration dependence of the cocaine-induced decrease in apparent CM . These data were adequately fit by a saturation hyperbola , which provided an estimate for the affinity of cocaine to SERT ( EC50 = 156 ± 41 nM; Figure 5F ) . This estimate is in line with the published KD of cocaine ( Hasenhuetl et al . , 2015 ) . Additionally , we explored the effect of 100 µM 5-HT on the apparent CM in the presence of external Cl- . Application of 5-HT reduced the membrane capacitance in cells expressing SERT but not in control cells ( Figure 5G ) . Upon removal of 5-HT , the membrane capacitance relaxed to the initial level in cells expressing SERT ( upper panel in Figure 5G ) . In the presence of extracellular Cl- the reduction in CM induced by 100 µM 5-HT amounted to −340 ± 140 fF ( Figure 5H ) . We also applied increasing concentrations of 5-HT to determine the concentration-response curve for the 5-HT-induced apparent reduction in CM . The resulting saturation hyperbola provided an estimate for the apparent affinity of 5-HT to SERT ( EC50 = 1 . 4 ± 0 . 1 µM , Figure 5I ) . Comparison of the apparent reduction of capacitance elicited by 100 µM cocaine and 100 µM 5-HT revealed no difference as is seen by the similar magnitude of the reduction in paired recordings ( Figure 5J ) . This equivalent capacitance change was expected because 100 µM is a saturating concentration for both ligands . Figure 5K shows the reduction in apparent CM at a saturating concentration of 5-HT ( 100 µM ) in the absence of extracellular Cl- . As can be seen the 5-HT-induced reduction in capacitance under this condition was similar to the one observed in the presence of Cl- ( cf . Figure 5I and H ) . The voltage dependence of the cocaine-induced capacitance change was analyzed using the protocol outlined in Figure 6A . We first measured the CM in the absence of cocaine at −50 mV , 0 mV and +50 mV and applied 100 µM cocaine thereafter . Consistent with the results shown in Figure 5A , application of cocaine reduced the CM in SERT-expressing cells ( left panel in Figure 6A ) but not in control cells ( right panel in Figure 6A ) . We also simulated the recordings in SERT-expressing cells using the Gouy-Chapman model: these synthetic data recapitulated the capacitance recordings ( cf . left panel in Figure 6A and Figure 6B ) . It is important to note that the Gouy-Chapman model also predicted the voltage-dependent change in capacitance observed in control cells ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1 ) . The capacitance recordings from eight independent experiments are summarized in Figure 6C . The black and the grey dashed lines represent the linear regression through the actual recordings and the changes predicted the Gouy-Chapman model , respectively . It is evident that ( i ) the cocaine-induced decrease in capacitance depends on the voltage in a linear manner , and ( ii ) that the experimental observations and the synthetic data are in reasonable agreement . However , there is one notable difference: in the absence of cocaine , changes in voltage were followed by a slow change in capacitance in SERT-expressing cells , in particular when the prior voltage had been +50 mV ( inset Figure 6A ) . The model does not account for this feature . Nevertheless , this slow change in capacitance is specific to SERT-expressing cells , because it is absent in control cells and inhibited by cocaine . We surmise that the transient change in capacitance reflects entry into/return from a state of SERT , which is occupied at very positive potentials . In the Gouy-Chapman model no reference is made to specific proteins or ligands . In this context , SERT is treated as an entity , which provides a ligand binding site and cocaine is a charged agent that adsorbs to it . This description is general . Accordingly , the model can make two predictions: ( i ) similar currents are expected to arise upon application of any charged ligand to cells expressing cognate membrane protein . ( ii ) Similarly , inhibitors other than cocaine are expected to induce transient currents when applied to cells expressing SERT . We tested both predictions . First , we challenged HEK293 cells expressing the dopamine transporter with cocaine: this gave rise to currents , which had a current-voltage relation with a negative slope ( Figure 7—figure supplement 1 ) . To test the second prediction we used desipramine binding to SERT . Consistent with the results obtained with cocaine , we detected an inwardly directed peak current upon rapid application of 100 µM desipramine ( Figure 7A ) . We also recorded a drop in apparent CM when cells expressing SERT were challenged with 10 µM desipramine ( representative trace in the left panel of Figure 7B ) . This was not seen in control cells ( right panel of Figure 7B ) . At concentrations exceeding 10 µM , desipramine increased CM in both SERT-expressing and control cells ( representative traces in Figure 7C ) . Thus , in SERT-expressing cells , the concentration-response curve for the desipramine-induced change in capacitance was biphasic with a decline in the low concentration range followed by an increase in the high concentration range ( full symbols in Figure 7D ) . In contrast , only the ascending limb of the concentration-response curve was seen in untransfected control cells ( empty symbols in Figure 7D ) . Desipramine is an amphiphilic cation . The increase in capacitance , which was seen at desipramine concentrations ≥ 30 µM in both SERT-expressing and untransfected HEK293 cells , can be rationalized by assuming that desipramine permeated the cell membrane and adsorbed to the inner surface . We carried out a simulation based on this conjecture , which recapitulated the capacitance recordings ( Figure 7E ) . Thus , the rise in capacitance was the expected consequence of desipramine adsorption to the inner surface of the membrane . We verified this conclusion by lowering the pH in the bath solution to 5 . 5 . This manipulation increases the fraction of protonated species of desipramine at the expense of the diffusible uncharged species ( pKa = 10 . 2 ) . Lowering the pH is therefore predicted to diminish the SERT-independent increase in CM , if this action is contingent on the presence of intracellular desipramine . This was the case: at pH 5 . 5 , 30 µM desipramine caused a decrease in apparent CM ( left panel in Figure 7F ) . In contrast , at pH 7 . 4 , 30 µM desipramine elicited an increase in capacitance ( right panel in Figure 7F ) . It is also evident from this representative trace ( right panel in Figure 7F ) that the increase at pH 7 . 4 was preceded by an initial decrease . This can be explained as follows: the initial decrease is the consequence of desipramine binding to SERT; the subsequent increase results from accumulation of intracellular desipramine . When assessed in paired recordings at pH 7 . 4 and pH 5 . 5 , 30 µM desipramine consistently produced a drop in capacitance at pH 5 . 5 but not at pH 7 . 4 ( Figure 7G ) . We also repeated these experiments in control cells ( Figure 7H ) . As expected , desipramine increased the capacitance at pH 7 . 4 ( ∆CM ~300 fC ) but was ineffective at pH 5 . 5 . Most inhibitors of SERT bind to the outward-facing conformation . However , ibogaine is one notable exception . Ibogaine stabilizes the inward-facing conformation of SERT and inhibits substrate uptake in a non-competitive fashion ( Jacobs et al . , 2007 ) . Ibogaine was therefore assumed to act on SERT by binding to a site in the inner vestibule . This implies that ibogaine gains access to the inner vestibule through the cytosol . We examined this hypothesis by measuring the effect of ibogaine on CM ( Figure 8 ) : application of 10 µM ibogaine resulted in a reduction of the CM ( upper panel in Figure 8A ) . This effect was absent in control cells ( lower panel in Figure 8A ) . Hence , these observations unequivocally refute the idea that ibogaine binds to a cytosolic site on SERT . Instead , our data suggest that the ibogaine binding site is directly accessible from the extracellular face of the transporter . We also evaluated the ibogaine-induced change in CM in paired recordings at pH 5 . 5 and 7 . 4 , which did not affect the response to ibogaine ( Figure 8B ) , although the difference in pH is expected to substantially decrease the fraction of non-protonated , membrane permeable ibogaine ( pKa = 8 . 05 ) . 3 Discussion The Gouy-Chapman model was developed more than a century ago to understand the distribution of diffusible ions residing on top of a charged and polarizable surface ( Gouy , 1909; Chapman , 1913 ) . While originally developed for a description of the interaction between dissolved ions and a metal electrode , this model also provides a conceptual framework to approach the electrical properties of a lipid bilayer . Fixed charges arise primarily from the net negative charge of phospholipid head groups ( McLaughlin et al . , 1971 ) . In addition , proteins which reside in or at the plasma membrane , also contribute to the surface charges ( Green and Andersen , 1991; Madeja , 2000 ) . In cells , these surface charges are asymmetrically distributed with the inner membrane leaflet carrying a higher negative surface charge density . The electrostatic forces between the dissolved ions and the fixed surface charges of the membrane drive the formation of a Gouy-Chapman diffusive layer . Thus , the underlying theory predicts , under voltage-clamp conditions , any binding reaction which results in adsorption of a charged ligand to the surface of the cell membrane must evoke a displacement current and an apparent change in capacitance . In spite of the veneration of the Gouy-Chapman model , the current experiments are – to the best of our knowledge - the first to demonstrate that binding reactions to surface proteins can be directly monitored by recording the predicted currents and the apparent changes of the membrane capacitance . In the present study , we exploited the rich pharmacology of SERT to test the predictions of the Gouy-Chapman model: ( i ) Inhibitors such as cocaine and desipramine produced a displacement current and the related change in apparent CM . Their binding per se did not result in movement of mobile charges within the membrane electric field and was fully accounted for by the change in outer surface charge density caused by ligand adsorption . This conclusion is supported by the negative slope of the current-voltage relation . In addition , the change in CM is consistent with the average density of SERT in the cell line employed: adsorption of one charged ligand/molecule gives rise to a change in CM of about 500 fF . ( ii ) Displacement currents were also seen with the substrate serotonin provided that chloride was omitted to eliminate the conformational change associated with substrate translocation . ( iii ) Finally , we used ibogaine to interrogate the Gouy-Chapman model; binding of ibogaine also produced a drop in apparent CM . While inhibitors bind to the outward-facing conformation , ibogaine traps SERT in the inward-facing conformation ( Jacobs et al . , 2007; Bulling et al . , 2012 ) . The precise binding site of ibogaine is unknown , but our capacitance recordings unequivocally refute the original hypothesis that ibogaine gains access to the inner vestibule . Our findings are also consistent with earlier observations , which showed that ibogaine was ineffective when administered to SERT via the patch electrode ( Bulling et al . , 2012 ) . SERT ligands are protonated amines , which form an ion pair with D98 in the orthosteric S1 binding site ( Coleman et al . , 2016 ) . Because of the large number of transporters expressed on the surface of our HEK293 cell line , adsorption of one ligand per transporter suffices to account for our experimental findings , both qualitatively and quantitatively . However , it is plausible that the binding of an uncharged ligand can also be detected by a capacitance change provided that ligand binding results in conformational rearrangements , which alter the solvent accessible surface of the protein . We note that on average the changes in apparent capacitance were somewhat larger with cocaine ( 495 fF , n = 29 ) than with ibogaine ( 283 fF , n = 7; p=0 . 0007 , Mann-Whitney U-test ) . This difference presumably reflects the difference in accessible surface charges in the cocaine- and the ibogaine-bound states . Finally , it is worth pointing out that capacitance measurements are more specific for monitoring binding events than the recording of the displacement current . The displacement currents evoked by cocaine , desipramine and 5-HT ( in the absence of Cl- ) validate the predictions of the Gouy-Chapman model . However , the small size and transient occurrence of these currents limit their applicability for the assessment of ligand/protein interactions . Measurement of the apparent change in CM is a better technique to investigate ligand binding because of the sustained amplitude change ( Figure 5 ) . An additional advantage of this readout is that measurements of CM are less susceptible to the masking effects of electrogenic transitions associated with conformational change . This was also seen in our recordings: the 5-HT-induced peak current was approximately three to four times larger than the cocaine peak , because most of the current elicited by 5-HT was produced by charges moving in response to conformational change , despite the small associated valence ( 0 . 15; Hasenhuetl et al . , 2016 ) . In contrast , the extent by which the capacitance was reduced was similar for cocaine and 5-HT ( Figure 5F ) . This can be explained as follows: the small valence associated with the mobile charge in SERT means that only a small fraction of this charge can be moved by the 80 mV voltage step used in our protocol to measure membrane capacitance . In fact , the simulation summarized in Figure 5—figure supplement 2 documents that the current is too small to affect the analysis , which allows for extraction of total capacitance and changes therein . We stress that measurements of capacitance rather than of ligand-induced transient currents allow for obtaining the true binding affinity . In this context , we also want to note that we estimated the minimal expression density of the target membrane protein required for detection of the ligand-induced change in apparent CM to be 20 , 000 units/pF ( see Materials and methods ) . We stress that adsorption of a ligand to a surface protein does not evoke an actual change in CM . Accordingly , we refer to the recorded alterations as apparent changes in capacitance . The point is illustrated by the equivalent circuit of a cell ( Figure 9 ) : the schematic representation depicts a battery ( Vϕ ) , which is connected in series with a capacitor ( CM ) representing the cell membrane . This battery was included to account for the voltage drop caused by the asymmetry of the surface charge densities at the outer and inner membrane leaflets . Importantly , this battery is the element in the circuit , which is affected by charged ligand adsorption . The physiological relevance of this battery in a living organism is readily appreciated: it is , for instance , known that the voltage for half-maximal activation ( V0 . 5 ) of voltage-gated ion channels can be shifted by the presence of divalent ions in the extracellular fluid ( Frankenhaeuser and Hodgkin , 1957 ) . This is the reason why hypocalcemia causes seizures . The shift in V0 . 5 is accounted for by the screening of surface charges by dissolved ions , which - similar to charged ligand adsorption - impinges on the highlighted battery . However , while surface charge screening is a long-range effect of ions that keep their hydration shell , ligand adsorption reflects a more specific interaction: it relies on tight binding of a ligand , which requires partial shedding of its water shell . We stress that in the case of surface charge screening no reference is made to the concept of binding affinities , which - in contrast - is implicit to charged ligand-adsorption to surface proteins . To study the kinetics of ligand binding , capacitance recordings are not a priori limited to charged ligands . In fact , any reaction which alters the surface charge in the membrane can be detected by recording the apparent change in capacitance . This conclusion is also supported by our observations that desipramine increased the apparent CM at concentrations exceeding 10 µM . Three lines of evidence indicate that this was a non-specific action: ( i ) the increase in capacitance was seen regardless of whether cells expressed SERT or not; ( ii ) it was not saturable and ( iii ) it was not mimicked by the other SERT ligands ( cocaine , serotonin and ibogaine ) . The most plausible explanation is to assume enrichment of desipramine at the inner leaflet of the membrane . The polar surface area is a good predictor of membrane permeability ( Palm et al . , 1998 ) . The polar surface areas for desipramine , cocaine and 5-HT are 15 Å2 , 56 Å2 and 62 Å2 , respectively ( values taken from https://www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov/pccompound ) . Thus , the low polar surface area of desipramine is consistent with its rapid permeation and the resulting change in capacitance . This is further supported by the findings of another study ( Sheetz and Singer , 1974 ) , which showed that amphiphilic cations , such as desipramine , accumulate at the inner membrane surface given that the surface charge density of the plasma membrane is more negative in the internal leaflet . Incidentally , these observations highlight applications of possible CM recordings , which go beyond measuring ligand binding in real time: there are many biological processes known to alter the amount and the distribution of solvent accessible charge in the membrane . This ( non-exhaustive ) list includes: ( i ) reactions which are orchestrated by flippases and floppases and maintain the vital asymmetry between inner and outer surface-charge densities ( Zachowski et al . , 1989; Groen et al . , 2011 ) ; ( ii ) dissipation of an existing charge-asymmetry by scramblases ( Zachowski , 1993; Suzuki et al . , 2010; Suzuki et al . , 2013 ) ; ( iii ) alteration of the charge density at the inner surface by enzymes , e . g . phospholipase C via cleavage of PIP2 ( Mauco et al . , 1979; Rittenhouse-Simmons , 1979 ) , lipid kinases ( Pike and Arndt , 1988 ) and phosphatases ( i . e . Pten , Maehama and Dixon , 1998 ) . These activities ought to be amenable to recordings of the membrane capacitance given that they result in a sufficiently large change in surface charge density . Thus , capacitance measurements may be useful to extract kinetic information on these key biological reactions in real time and by a label-free approach . 4 Materials and methods Recordings of tetracycline-inducible HEK293 cells stably expressing a GFP-tagged human serotonin transporter ( hSERT ) were performed . HEK293 cells have been previously authenticated by STR profiling at the Medical University of Graz ( Cell Culture Core Facility ) . The cells were regularly tested for mycoplasma contamination by DAPI staining . The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium ( DMEM ) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and selection antibiotics ( 150 μg∙ml−1 zeocin and 6 μg∙ml−1 blasticidin ) . Twenty-four h prior to the experiment , the cells were seeded onto poly-D-lysine-coated dishes ( 35 mm Nunc Cell-culture dishes , Thermoscientific , USA ) containing medium supplemented with 1 μg∙ml−1 tetracycline . If not stated otherwise , the cells were continuously superfused with an external solution containing 140 mM NaCl , 3 mM KCl , 2 . 5 mM CaCl2 , 2 mM MgCl2 , 20 mM glucose , and 10 mM HEPES ( pH adjusted to 7 . 4 with NaOH ) . In some instances the following changes were made: ( i ) for experiments at pH 5 . 5 , HEPES was substituted by 2- ( N-morpholino ) ethansulfonic-acid; ( ii ) for experiments in Na+-free external solution , NaCl was replaced by NMDG+ ( N-methyl-D-glucamine ) Cl-; ( iii ) for experiments in Cl--free external solution , NaCl was replaced by Na+MES- ( methanesulfonate ) . The internal solution in the patch pipette contained 152 mM NaCl , 1 mM CaCl2 , 0 . 7 mM MgCl2 , 10 mM HEPES , and 10 mM EGTA ( ethylenglycol-bis ( aminoethylether ) -N , N , N′ , N′-tetra-acidic-acid ) ( pH 7 . 2 adjusted with NaOH ) . Where indicated , the internal Cl- concentration was reduced ( 152 mM NaOH , 1 mM CaCl2 , 0 . 7 mM MgCl2 , 10 mM EGTA , 10 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 2 adjusted with methaneosulfonic acid ) . Ligands were applied via a four-tube or eight-tube ALA perfusion manifold using the Octaflow perfusion system ( ALA Scientific Instruments , USA ) , which allowed for complete solution exchange around the cells within 100 ms . Currents were recorded at room temperature ( 20–24°C ) using an Axopatch 200B amplifier and pClamp 10 . 2 software ( MDS Analytical Technologies ) . Current traces were filtered at 1 kHz and digitized at 10 kHz using a Digidata 1440 ( MDS Analytical Technologies ) . The recordings were analyzed with Clampfit 10 . 2 software . Passive holding currents were subtracted , and the traces were additionally filtered using a 100 Hz digital Gaussian low-pass filter . Recordings were performed in the whole-cell configuration . For the measurement we used a train of square wave voltage pulses with an amplitude ±40 mV and a frequency of 200 Hz . Bipolar square waves were used for measuring capacitance , because they are less sensitive to changes in series resistance ( RS ) and membrane resistance ( RM ) when compared with other methods for high-resolution membrane capacitance recording ( Lindau and Neher , 1988; Thompson et al . , 2001 ) . In the protocol the holding potential was set to 0 mV if not stated otherwise . Exponential current responses were low pass filtered by a 10 kHz Bessel filter and sampled at 100 kHz rate . The cross talk between RS and CM was further suppressed as follows: the acquired current traces were first deconvoluted with the transfer function of the recording apparatus and the passive membrane parameters of a cell were calculated from the theoretical function as described elsewhere ( Hoťka and Zahradník , 2017 ) . This method provides reliable CM estimates even in conditions where large changes in RS occur ( 1 MΩ change in RS produces a CM change smaller than 1 fF; Hoťka and Zahradník , 2017 ) . The pipette capacitance was recorded in the cell-attached mode first and subtracted from the currents recorded in the whole-cell configuration prior to further analysis . The patch pipettes used had a resistance of 2–4 MΩ . To stabilize the level of stray capacitance , the pipettes were coated with hydrophobic resin Sylgard184 ( Dow Corning , USA ) . The method of bipolar square wave stimulation can be rendered largely insensitive to changes in stray capacitance ( CS ) by ignoring the current during the time when the stray capacitor charges ( Lindau and Neher , 1988 ) . It takes 60 µs to fully charge the stray capacitor , which only affects the first six sample points of the recorded current ( sampling rate = 100 kHz ) . In contrast , the time required to charge the cell membrane is in the order of hundreds of microseconds . By removing the first six data points it is therefore possible to provide estimates of CM , which are insensitive to changes in CS ( Thompson et al . , 2001; Novák and Zahradník , 2006; Hoťka and Zahradník , 2017 ) . A detailed description of the method can be found in Burtscher et al . ( 2019 ) . The membrane capacitance of SERT-expressing HEK293 cells was estimated using bipolar square wave stimulation . The voltage step of amplitude VM drives the translocation of capacitive charge . However , according to the Gouy-Chapman theory , the transmembrane potential ( Φt ) is not equal to VM ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) . Φt deviates from VM , by Φi-VM-Φo . Where Φi and Φo are the potentials at the inner and outer surface , respectively . The potentials on each side of a membrane ( Φi and Φo ) ) are coupled by capacitive charges . To calculate these potentials , we adopted the equations from Genet and co-workers ( Genet et al . , 2000 ) . These coupled equations describe the relation between the mobile ( Q ) and fixed ( σ ) membrane charge densities and the potential drops of the bulk regions ( Φ ) . We used the notation according to Plaksin and co-workers ( Plaksin et al . , 2017a , Plaksin et al . , 2017b ) . ( 1 ) σo-εbδbΦi-Φo2=2εSolRT∑j=1ncjo∞×ezjoFΦoRT-1 ( 2 ) σi+εbδbΦi-Φo2=2εSolRT∑j=1ncji∞×e-zjiFRTΦi-VM-1 Where εSol is a dielectric constant of a bulk solution; R and F are the ideal gas and Faraday constants; T is the absolute temperature; cj∞ are the intracellular and extracellular ion concentrations far from the membrane and zj is ion valence . The equations were solved numerically for Φi and Φo . These values were used to calculate the transmembrane voltage: Φt =Φi-Φo . The cocaine binding to a SERT-expressing HEK293 cell was modeled as the reduction of outer surface charge density proportional to the number of transporters with a single binding site for cocaine ( representing 1 surface charge ) . This reduction in a surface charge density gives rise to a change in Φo and via Eq . 1 and Eq . 2 also in Φi . The experimentally observed ligand-induced currents were modeled as capacitive currents resulting from the change of Φtcaused by ligand application . Their amplitudes are proportional to the total membrane capacitance of a cell Ctheoretical and the amplitude of an induced voltage change: ( 3 ) i ( t ) =CtheoreticaldΦi-Φodt The same model was also used to simulate the observed changes in membrane capacitance . The calculated voltage Φt =Φi-Φo is used to estimate the total capacitive charge: ( 4 ) Q= ΦtAεbδb In the real recording situation , the estimation of CM from exponential current responses elicited by voltage steps assumes that the applied voltage VM is equal to the voltage drop across the membrane Φt . To mimic the real measurement , we keep this assumption and we calculate the CM estimates from the total charge Q using a theoretical value of VM by equation: ( 5 ) CM=Q/VM Upon ligand application , surface charge density on the outer leaflet is reduced . Therefore , the transmembrane voltage Φt is altered . The use of VM instead of Φt in Eq . 5 thus gives rise to apparent changes in membrane capacitance . The average standard deviation of the capacitance signal was derived from 12 independent measurements . Each trace analyzed had a time length of 5 s ( sampling rate = 50 Hz ) . The average SD calculated was 4 . 84 ± 1 . 16 fF . We assumed a detectable change in capacitance amplitude if this exceeded two SDs . We used this value to estimate the minimal expression density of the target membrane protein required for detection of ligand-induced change in apparent membrane capacitance . The calculated density amounted to approximately 20 , 000 units/pF . However , this value applies only if the ligand neutralizes one surface charge on the protein . Accordingly , the lowest expression density required to detect change in apparent capacitance is decreased if a charged ligand adsorbs to more surface charges on the target protein . The apparent association rate ( kapp ) of cocaine to SERT was calculated based on the previously estimated association and dissociation rate constants ( Hasenhuetl et al . , 2015 ) and was plotted as a function of the cocaine concentration ( dashed line in Figure 4D ) . The rates were modeled as: kapp = kon*[Cocaine] +koff . We attribute the discrepancy between the theoretical and the measured rates to the finite solution exchange rate of our application device ( ~20 s−1 ) . To model the corrected rate , we used a two-state model and simulated pseudo-first order binding assuming an exponential rise in cocaine concentration with the rate of solution exchange ."}

It is currently the leading cause of death by a single microbe worldwide , claiming the lives of 1 . 5 million people annually . The disease is difficult to cure , as many strains of the bacterium have developed resistance to the main drugs used to treat the infection . This leaves physicians with few options to treat tuberculosis and control its spread . The spread of these drug-resistant strains is a major global public health problem . New strategies that do not lead to drug resistance are needed . One possibility would be to starve the bacterium . Like all living things , M . tuberculosis must eat to survive and spread . Right now , scientists do not know much about how this microbe eats . However , they do know that it needs nitrogen – an essential part of DNA , RNA , and proteins – to survive . Most bacteria like to consume ammonium as their main nitrogen source , but they may also use select amino acids as a nitrogen source . Now , Agapova et al . show that M . tuberculosis is not a picky eater . In the experiments , the bacteria were fed different nitrogen sources . Then , they tracked how well the bacteria grew . The experiments showed that M . tuberculosis happily eats many different amino acids and may use more than one as a nitrogen source at a time . It does not tightly control its stockpile of nitrogen sources the way other bacteria do , or use ammonium very efficiently . This suggests that M . tuberculosis has evolved to be very flexible in its dietary habits , which may explain why these bacteria can thrive in the varied environments within the human body . Knowing exactly how M . tuberculosis acquires and uses nitrogen may help scientists design ways to thwart the process and starve the bacteria .", "article": "1 Introduction Human tuberculosis , caused by the bacillus Mycobacterium tuberculosis , is now the greatest cause of death by a single infectious agent , surpassing deaths caused by HIV/AIDS ( WHO , 2017 ) . Tuberculosis is a complex and unique disease , whereby M . tuberculosis evades eradication by the immune system and often by chemotherapy with antibiotics . As with other bacterial diseases , tuberculosis is increasingly drug resistant , with strains resistant to two front-line drugs , isoniazid and rifampicin ( multi-drug resistant ) , and additional resistance to an injectable antibiotic and a quinolone ( extensive-drug resistant ) killing now over 500 thousand patients out of a total of 1 , 800 , 000 deaths ( WHO , 2017 ) . Although novel first-in-class antitubercular agents have been discovered in the last 20 years ( Tiberi et al . , 2018 ) , resistance to these agents and important side effects might preclude their widespread utilization and hence the reversal of the epidemic . We and others believe that failures in drug discovery programmes aimed at finding transformative antitubercular agents are in large part caused by our incomplete understanding of bacterial phenotypic diversity in the host ( Barry et al . , 2009 ) . Bacterial metabolic flexibility is thought to be essential for growth and survival in a variety of niches , where low pH , low oxygen tension , presence of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species , and scarcity of nutrients are commonly found . Although we are aware and partially understand some of the effects of low oxygen and mild acidic pH on M . tuberculosis growth and metabolism ( Eoh and Rhee , 2013; Eoh et al . , 2017 ) , we clearly do not know the full complement of conditions and niches occupied by M . tuberculosis . In addition , we do not understand more fundamental aspects of M . tuberculosis nutrition and metabolism even in pure cultures devoid of host cells . Despite all research carried out with M . tuberculosis in the last decades , we still lack fundamental understanding on how its unique metabolic network promotes survival in the human host , pathogenesis , and long-term persistence ( Rhee et al . , 2011; Ehrt et al . , 2018 ) . Most current knowledge of host-relevant M . tuberculosis metabolism spans central carbon metabolism ( e . g . glycolysis , gluconeogenesis , glyoxylate bypass ) ( recently reviewed in Ehrt et al . , 2018 ) . In contrast , very little is known about nitrogen metabolism , in particular , we do not understand what are the essential features of nitrogen metabolism in M . tuberculosis ( Gouzy et al . , 2014a ) . For example , while we understand how post-translational regulation of nitrogen metabolism operates in mycobacteria ( Carroll et al . , 2008; Cowley et al . , 2004; Nott et al . , 2009; O'Hare et al . , 2008; Pashley et al . , 2006; Read et al . , 2007; Rieck et al . , 2017; Parish and Stoker , 2000 ) , transcriptional regulation of nitrogen metabolism in M . tuberculosis is largely unknown . M . tuberculosis lacks homologues for nearly all known bacterial transcriptional factors involved in nitrogen metabolism in other bacteria Figure 1—figure supplement 1 , and the transcriptional factor GlnR does not perform canonical functions ( Williams et al . , 2015 ) . Instead , it appears that GlnR regulates ammonia and nitrate uptake in M . tuberculosis ( Williams et al . , 2015 ) . Simple comparison of growth kinetics in identical culture medium reveals that M . smegmatis and M . tuberculosis growth differs significantly , not only due to inherent growth rate differences , but also lag phase and final biomass achieved Figure 1—figure supplement 2 , points to species-specific variations in nitrogen metabolism . Importantly , the vast majority of studies to date focused exclusively on either ammonium ( NH4+ ) as the sole physiologically relevant nitrogen source ( Williams et al . , 2015; Petridis et al . , 2015 ) or employed surrogate fast-growing species such a M . smegmatis instead of M . tuberculosis ( Petridis et al . , 2015 ) . For example , GlnR of M . smegmatis is evolutionarily closer to the homologues present in Nocardia farcina and Rhodococcus sp . RHA1 than those found in M . tuberculosis , M . bovis and M . avium ( Amon et al . , 2009 ) , which could indicate different functions of GlnR within the Mycobacterium genus . This discrepancy indicates that M . smegmatis cannot be used as a model of M . tuberculosis with regards to nitrogen metabolism . A number of studies were published at the time the now common culture media for in vitro growth of M . tuberculosis were developed ( Proskauer and Beck , 1894 ) . These studies provided rigorous and systematic analysis of the effect of amino acids as growth promoters for M . tuberculosis . In spite of this , four main issues preclude a deeper interpretation of the results obtained . First , cultures were not pre-adapted in the amino acids tested as sole nitrogen sources , leading to results that are likely partially distorted due to the nitrogen sources in the prior culture media . Second , cultures often contain multiple nitrogen sources , which complicate the analysis . Third , only recently nitrogen tracing was made possible by the use of modern high-resolution mass spectrometers and the use of labelled and position-specific labelled nitrogen sources . Finally , in a number of studies , qualitative results were reported instead of doubling times or growth rates , precluding direct comparisons between studies , conditions and/or species . In 2013–2014 , two key studies unveiled an important aspect of host-relevant nitrogen metabolism in M . tuberculosis , namely that host amino acids such as L-aspartate ( Asp ) and L-asparagine ( Asn ) are important sources of nitrogen during infection ( Gouzy et al . , 2014b; Gouzy et al . , 2013 ) . These findings open a new avenue in host-M . tuberculosis relevant metabolism , revealing the use of organic nitrogen sources by M . tuberculosis during infection . Although genomic data can be used to construct plausible sets of reactions that might form the core nitrogen metabolic network in M . tuberculosis ( such as the one shown in Figure 1 ) , these models are to some extent incomplete and inaccurate . Utilization of host amino acids as nitrogen sources requires some distinct characteristics from the M . tuberculosis metabolic network , which have neither been described or formally investigated to date in model organisms and hence cannot be modelled based on such systems . Another important metabolic network property to be considered is the ability to co-metabolise multiple nutrient ( nitrogen ) sources . In contrast to NH4+ , amino acids have been largely under-studied as nitrogen sources for M . tuberculosis . In spite of this , there is now overwhelming evidence on the importance of amino acids during infection , highlighted by the profound infection attenuation observed with genetic knockout strains ( Berney et al . , 2015; Hondalus et al . , 2000 ) . We therefore decided to explore the structure and operation of the M . tuberculosis core nitrogen metabolic network with amino acids as nitrogen sources , employing a combination of bacterial physiology , metabolomics and stable isotope labelling experiments . 2 Results As a first investigation on amino acid uptake and utilization by M . tuberculosis , we transferred bacteria-laden filters after 5 days’ growth on 7H10 media to individual fresh 7H10 agar plates containing 1 mM of each of the 20 proteinogenic amino acids . Cells were harvested 17 hr after transfer . Metabolites were extracted , separated , identified and quantified by liquid-chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry , following procedures described elsewhere ( de Carvalho et al . , 2010; Larrouy-Maumus et al . , 2013 ) . The majority of amino acid intracellular pool sizes vary only modestly when M . tuberculosis is grown in media containing sole nitrogen sources different to NH4Cl ( Figure 2a , b ) . However , an increase in intracellular pool size is observed for Gly , Ala , Val , Ile , Met , Pro , Phe , Tyr , Trp , Ser , Thr , Arg , and His when M . tuberculosis was cultured with the cognate amino acid as sole nitrogen source ( highlighted in the diagonal of Figure 2a ) . Importantly , all amino acids present as sole nitrogen source alter the pool size of the cognate amino acid and/or other amino acid in M . tuberculosis , demonstrating that they are taken up . On Figure 2b , the data from Figure 2a are replotted to illustrate individual amino acids changes obtained with M . tuberculosis grown with different amino acids as sole nitrogen sources . These data show the final concentrations in samples , not fold-change , compared to NH4+ conditions . With few exceptions ( Met and Trp ) no change is observed in the summed amino acid pool size , when M . tuberculosis is incubated with different amino acids as the sole nitrogen source . Figure 2c contains the data from Figure 2b replotted as summed fold-change versus NH4Cl . Trp and His as sole nitrogen sources display significant effects on the summed abundance , but most of the other amino acids do not significantly affect overall pool size . In other words , Trp and His are readily taken up by M . tuberculosis and stored at high concentrations . Figure 2d shows data for all amino acids , independent of nitrogen source . It is apparent that most amino acid concentrations are not significantly altered in different nitrogen sources . Also , it is noteworthy that some amino acid concentrations vary considerably in different nitrogen sources , ( e . g . Pro , Asp , Gln , Glu and Ala ) . Figure 2e illustrates amino acid levels observed when the cognate amino acid or NH4Cl were used as sole nitrogen source . Data further illustrate that nearly all amino acid pool sizes are altered when the cognate amino acid is present in the growth medium , as sole nitrogen source . This data is also highlighted on the diagonal in Figure 2a . Curiously , no change is observed in Leu , Asn , Gln , Asp , Glu and Lys when the respective cognate amino acid was added to the growth medium . Figure 2f illustrates the concentrations of Gln in M . tuberculosis when different amino acids or NH4Cl are present in the growth medium . Interestingly , very little change in Gln pool size is observed . This is surprising , as Gln is thought to be one of the key indicators of nitrogen levels in cells , alongside with α-ketoglutarate ( Senior , 1975 ) . Overall , these results indicate that M . tuberculosis does not control the pool sizes of all 20 amino acids homeostatically , given that the intracellular concentrations of certain amino acids rise or fall depending on extracellular amino acid/nitrogen source availability . This finding suggests that there are two groups of proteinogenic amino acids in M . tuberculosis , the ones that are homeostatically controlled and the ones which intracellular concentration will be affected by extracellular availability . These results also document directly , for the first time , the ability of M . tuberculosis to uptake all 20 proteinogenic amino acids . Before carrying out an in-depth analysis of nitrogen metabolism we investigated whether or not the medium used to culture M . tuberculosis prior to switching to media with defined sole nitrogen sources could lead to false results . Pre-culture medium composition has been shown to affect carbon metabolism ( de Carvalho et al . , 2010 ) . We ‘pre-cultured’ M . tuberculosis in either standard Middlebrook 7H9 broth ( containing Glu and NH4+ ) or a 7H9NH4+ broth ( a synthetic version of Middlebrook 7H9 broth , with NH4+ as sole nitrogen source ) , prior to the experiment in 7H9NH4+ broth . When pre-conditioned in standard 7H9 , growth of M . tuberculosis in 7H9NH4+ led to a significantly higher biomass accumulation than when pre-conditioned in 7H9NH4+Figure 3—figure supplement 1 . Therefore , without pre-adaptation in the nitrogen source that will be tested , such experiments will likely always overestimate the potential of nitrogen sources . This is particularly problematic when working with compounds that are not able to serve as sole nitrogen source , or are poor sole nitrogen source . Based on these results , all experiments were carried out with cultures that were pre-adapted in a medium of identical composition to the test medium for at least 3 days ( unless otherwise stated ) . Of note , a potential confounding factor in our experiments is the presence of carbon-containing nitrogen sources , such as amino acids , and carbon-free , such as NH4Cl , which could lead to faster grown . However , our media contains an excess of carbon sources ( 2 g/L glucose and 2 . 52 g/L glycerol ) , and therefore it is unlikely that additional carbon in the form of amino acids can account for the results described below . Figure 3d shows representative growth curves obtained in Glu , Gln , Asp , Asn and NH4Cl , as sole nitrogen sources . All four amino acids were superior nitrogen sources to NH4Cl , at all concentrations tested ( Figure 3b and c ) , both in terms of doubling rate and final biomass generated . It is noteworthy that pre-adaptation in medium with NH4Cl as sole nitrogen source shows that M . tuberculosis can only optimally utilise NH4+ as sole nitrogen source until up to 0 . 25 g/L ( 4 . 67 mM ) . Higher concentrations of NH4Cl lead to less growth , indicating that high concentrations of ammonium are toxic . Based on these results the following order represents the preferential utilisation of sole nitrogen sources ( considering final biomass ) : Glu > Asp > Asn > Gln > NH4+ . Interestingly , when pre-adapted cultures were grown in medium containing no nitrogen source , growth persisted in all cases ( Figure 3d ) . This limited growth is likely due to the low levels of ferric ammonium citrate ( 0 . 04 g/L ) added to the medium as an iron source . Moreover , this growth was different , depending on nitrogen source: cells pre-adapted to Asp , Asn and NH4Cl allowed growth to an OD ~1 . 0 , while those pre-adapted to Glu and Gln grew to OD ~0 . 2 . To confirm the ‘metabolic conditioning effect’ induced by the pre-adaptation medium , we sub-cultured cells after 15 days into fresh medium ( with only ferric ammonium citrate ) . Pre-adaptation with Glu and Gln again led to poor growth , while cells derived from medium containing Asp , Asn and NH4Cl grew to an OD ~1 , in a concentration-dependent manner ( Figure 3e ) . In similar experiments , where ferric citrate was used instead of ferric ammonium citrate , negligible growth was observed in derived from media containing Glu and Asp , while slightly better growth was observed with cells derived from media containing Gln , Asn and NH4+ ( Figure 3f ) . These results indicate that M . tuberculosis does not store nitrogen to any major extent . Taken together , these results reveal that the amino acids Glu , Gln , Asp , and Asn are superior to NH4+ as sole nitrogen sources for M . tuberculosis , leading to high biomass and faster growth . When traces of NH4+ are present but no added nitrogen sources have been included , prior sole nitrogen exposure does have an effect on growth , likely indicative of complex metabolism which probably also involves carbon metabolism . An essential step in the analysis of nitrogen metabolism with nitrogen sources containing more than one nitrogen atom , such as Gln and Asn , is to define which nitrogen atom ( s ) is/are being utilised . This characteristic is likely variable and species-specific , and the precise nature of which is currently unclear in M . tuberculosis . To confirm which metabolic reactions are likely taking place , we performed labeling experiments with position-specific labelled Gln and Asn ( Figure 4a ) . The most direct chemical reactions producing five key amino acids ( Glu , Gln , Asp , Asn and Ala ) and the label incorporation data obtained from doubly and position-specific labelled 15N-Gln and 15N-Asn are shown in Figure 4b–f . These results indicate that both nitrogen atoms from Gln and Asn are utilised by M . tuberculosis and , specifically that: ( i ) glutamate synthase is converting the δ15N from Gln into α15N-Glu ( Figure 4b ) , explaining the incorporation of δ15N from Gln into the α15N-Asp , via direct transamination from α15N-Glu ( Figure 4d ) ; ( ii ) direct transamination between α15N-Glu , the other product of the glutamate synthase reaction , and α15N-Asp is clearly observed ( Figure 4d ) ; ( iii ) when position-specific labelled Asn is used , the dominant form of Asp observed in α15N-Asp ( Figure 4d ) , indicating that the NH4+ released by asparaginase is likely assimilated to Gln which is distributed broadly in metabolism ( Figure 4b , c and f ) , but only modestly to Asp ( Figure 4d ) ; ( iv ) labelled Asn is only detectable when Asn is the nitrogen source ( Figure 4e ) , confirming that no Asn synthesis is taking place in M . tuberculosis . In contrast to common knowledge , a number of bacteria , including mycobacteria , do not synthesize Asn using asparagine synthetase , but instead they employ a pathway that relies on the amidation of Asp-tRNAAsn ( Javid et al . , 2014 ) ( v ) use of either position-specific labelled Gln or Asn , leads to identical labelling of Glu ( Figure 4b ) , consistent with access of both α and γ/δ nitrogen atoms; ( vi ) labelling of Gln with position specific Gln and Asn is indistinguishable , demonstrating that all nitrogen derived from Asn is mobilised through Gln ( Figure 4c ) ; and ( vii ) labelling patterns obtained for Ala in the presence of position-specific labelled Gln and Asn are very similar , indicating again that most of the nitrogen derived from Asn is assimilated first into Gln , and then distributed to other metabolites , reflecting the data shown in Figure 4c . Label incorporation from 15N Glu , 15N2-Gln , 15N-Asp , 15N2-Asn and 15NH4Cl obtained under metabolic steady-state , over the course of 17 hr , revealed several important features of M . tuberculosis nitrogen metabolism , including different kinetics of 15N labelling ( Figure 4g and h , and Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) . As expected , regardless of the nitrogen source , robust label incorporation into amino acids belonging to core nitrogen metabolism was observed , with exception of Asn , which was only observed when cells grew in Asn as sole nitrogen source ( Figure 4g ) . It is noteworthy that the Ala pool size and labelling was significantly higher when NH4Cl or Asn was the sole nitrogen source . Also , in agreement with data shown in Figure 2a , external amino acid availability does not necessarily correlate with increased intracellular pool size . For example , Glu and Gln are more abundant with Asp and Asn as the sole nitrogen source , respectively ( rather than in the cognate amino acid as sole nitrogen source ) . Taking the position-specific labelling data and corresponding likely metabolic paths , in conjunction with current biochemical and genetic knowledge of the enzymes of the core nitrogen metabolic network ( summarised in Figure 1 ) , we calculated exponential labelling rates ( R ) and maximum labelling levels ( Lmax ) for various core amino acids when Asp , Asn , Glu , Gln and NH4Cl were used as sole nitrogen sources ( Figure 4h and Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) . Lmax for different sole nitrogen sources appears to be similar ( Figure 4h ) , indicating that , in principle , nitrogen derived from Glu , Gln , Asp , Asn and NH4+ can reach similar high levels ( close to 100% ) in the core nitrogen metabolites of M . tuberculosis before the first division ( 17 hr ) . ( Figure 4h ) . In contrast , R values varied considerably , depending on the sole nitrogen source present and reactions needed to transfer the 15N atom to individual metabolites ( Figure 4h ) . Once again , it is clear that NH4+ is not the most efficient nitrogen source for M . tuberculosis , as it leads to only modest labelling of key core metabolites , compared to other sole nitrogen sources . Lmax and R for Asn are only consistently observed when Asn is used as sole nitrogen source , supporting the idea that M . tuberculosis has a very small Asn pool ( Figure 4g and h ) . L% in Figure 4h illustrates early ( 2 hr incubation ) labelling of metabolites , and further highlights the differences in R values for each nitrogen source . Of note , the metabolic patterns observed with different nitrogen sources are not secondary , i . e . derived from effects on carbon metabolism . As can be seen in Figure 4—figure supplement 2 , very little changes in the pool sizes of key metabolites from glycolysis and Krebs cycle are observed and those do not correlate with nitrogen source usage . M . tuberculosis has been shown to be able to co-catabolise carbon sources ( de Carvalho et al . , 2010 ) , resulting in a better growth than the one observed in individual carbon sources . Co-catabolism of carbon sources is a metabolic feature highly unusual in bacteria , which usually catabolise carbon sources sequentially , displaying biphasic ( diauxic ) growth kinetics . In the case of host-adapted pathogens , co-catabolism is thought to contribute to improved survival , although no direct knowledge of co-catabolism of nitrogen sources exists at present . To investigate the potential for this in M . tuberculosis , we grew cells in media containing the following combinations of nitrogen sources: 15N-Glu+14N-Gln , 14N-Glu+U15N-Gln , 15N-Asp+14N-Asn , or 14N-Asp+U15N-Asn . All nitrogen source combinations lead to robust labelling of Glu , Gln , Asp , Asn ( Figure 5 ) , indicating that M . tuberculosis is indeed able to take up and co-metabolise nitrogen sources . Extracted ion chromatograms ( Figure 5a ) show significant 15N metabolism in all conditions ( i . e . high levels of labelled metabolites in the absence of labelled nitrogen sources ) . Mass spectral data ( Figure 5b ) show that Gln ( initially labelled or unlabelled ) has been metabolised extensively , generating all three isotopologues ( 14N2 , 14N15N and 15N2 ) . Mass spectral analysis further confirms that no Asn is being synthesised in M . tuberculosis , as no labelled Asn ( 15N2 or 15N1 ) is found when 15N-Asp is used as nitrogen source and no 15N-Asn is present when 15N2-Asn is provided as nitrogen source . Figure 5c provides average values and errors for labelling of Glu , Gln , Asp , Asn and Ala , in dual nitrogen sources . Interestingly , Ala labelling appears to derive mainly from Asn , rather than Asp . This suggests that Asn is being hydrolysed to Asp and NH4+ , and likely that Ala is either a main entry point for 15NH4+ or it serves as nitrogen storage . This result is in strict agreement with the very fast and extensive label incorporation of Ala when using 15NH4+ or 15N-Asn as sole nitrogen sources ( Figure 4g and h ) . In spite of clear co-metabolism of two different nitrogen sources , no growth advantage ( faster doubling time and highest biomass ) is observed Figure 5—figure supplement 1 . Therefore , it seems that while M . tuberculosis uses multiple nitrogen sources simultaneously co-metabolism of related nitrogen sources ( i . e . Glu/Gln and Asp/Asn ) does not lead to improved growth ( i . e . fastest growth and higher biomass achieved ) . Ala pool size and labelling patterns ( Figure 4g and h ) are incompatible with our current understanding of nitrogen metabolism in M . tuberculosis . If NH4+ utilization , either direct or derived from Asn , proceeded through glutamine synthetase or glutamate dehydrogenase , labelling of Glu would always be greater than Ala , which would be produced by transamination of Glu . However , this is not the case . To investigate Ala metabolism in the context of nitrogen assimilation , we first confirmed whether Ala could serve as a nitrogen source . Figure 6a shows that M . tuberculosis can grow in the presence of Ala as a sole nitrogen source , or in binary combination of Ala with Glu , Gln , Asp , Asn , or NH4+Cl . These results are consistent with Ala being utilised as a sole nitrogen source and in combination with other nitrogen sources , but without any growth advantage ( mirroring the result observed for Glu/Gln and Asp/Asn co-metabolism ) . qPCR analysis of transcript levels for asparaginase ( ansA ) , glutamine synthetase ( glnA1 ) , glutamate dehydrogenase ( gdh ) and alanine dehydrogenase ( ald ) , in sole nitrogen sources was carried out to define if transcriptional programmes are involved in control of nitrogen metabolism , and in particular of alanine dehydrogenase , despite the current lack of potential transcriptional regulators of nitrogen metabolism ( Figure 6b ) . Consistent with the hypothesis that alanine dehydrogenase works as a NH4+ assimilatory route , ald RNA levels are found to be higher when M . tuberculosis was grown in media with NH4+ , Asn , Asp and Gln , compared to nitrogen-free medium ( Figure 6b , -N/+N ) . In addition , ald RNA levels are found to be decreased under nitrogen starved conditions , in comparison to gdh , glnA1 and ansA RNA levels ( Figure 6b , 0/-N ) , suggesting that ald-driven nitrogen assimilation is likely more important under nitrogen-rich conditions . The constant levels of expression of ald gene when Ala was the sole nitrogen source is likely due to the oxidative deamination of Ala ( physiological reaction ) is significantly favoured over the reductive amination of pyruvate , and therefore much less enzyme is required . To define the role of ald-encoded alanine dehydrogenase in mobilisation of nitrogen to and from Ala , we compared a M . tuberculosis lacking ald , to parental and complemented strains ( Giffin et al . , 2012 ) . Genetic disruption of ald completely abolished the ability of M . tuberculosis to grow when Ala was the sole nitrogen source , with no effect when NH4+ or Gln were sole nitrogen sources ( Figure 6c ) . These results demonstrate that alanine dehydrogenase is essential for assimilation of NH4+ from Ala , as shown elsewhere ( Giffin et al . , 2012 ) . Interestingly , growth was also significantly diminished in the ald-knockout strain when Asp was the sole nitrogen source; however , only partial complementation was obtained ( Figure 6c ) . Growth of parent , ald-knockout and complemented strains was indistinguishable in NH4+ as sole nitrogen source , confirming that ald is not the main route for NH4+ assimilation in M . tuberculosis . This secondary role of alanine dehydrogenase in assimilation is further supported by lack of changes in label incorporation into Glu , Gln and Ala when parent , ald-knockout , and complemented strains were grown with 15NH4+Cl or 15N-Gln ( Figure 6d ) . Final evidence for the essentiality of alanine dehydrogenase in nitrogen assimilation from Ala and secondary role during 15N assimilation was obtained using the inhibitors of alanine dehydrogenase and glutamine synthetase , bromo-pyruvate ( Bellion and Tan , 1987 ) and methionine sulfoximine ( Harth and Horwitz , 1999 ) , respectively ( Figure 6e and f ) . Bromo-pyruvate partially inhibits growth when NH4+ , Ala and Glu are used as sole nitrogen source , but not in Gln . In addition to alanine dehydrogenase , glutamate dehydrogenase is likely also partially inhibited at the concentrations tested , leading to the phenotype observed with bromo-pyruvate in Glu ( Figure 6f , top panels ) . Methionine sulfoximine completely abrogated growth in NH4+ and to a less extent in Ala and Glu but not in Gln as the sole nitrogen source ( Figure 6f , bottom panels ) . Together , these results demonstrate that alanine dehydrogenase is essential for utilisation of Ala as sole nitrogen source , but not the main route for NH4+ assimilation , a task undertaken primarily by glutamine synthetase . 3 Discussion Despite knowing that amino acids can be used by M . tuberculosis in vitro for over one hundred years ( Proskauer and Beck , 1894 ) only in 2013 and 2014 the first two reports of amino acid utilisation as nitrogen sources by M . tuberculosis during infection were published ( Gouzy et al . , 2014b; Gouzy et al . , 2013 ) . Based on these studies , we set out to evaluate how M . tuberculosis utilises nitrogen derived from amino acids in comparison to NH4+ . An unbiased parallel analysis of amino acid uptake and metabolism reveals for the first time that M . tuberculosis can uptake all 20 proteinogenic amino acids . Of interest , it seems that several amino acids can be stored in M . tuberculosis , leading to a significant increase in pool size . Such dramatic increase in pool size indicates that the levels of certain amino acids are not homeostatically controlled , but might partially reflect the composition of the medium where bacteria grow . These results coupled with growth kinetic analysis indicates that Glu , Gln , Asp , Asn , Ala are taken up and rapidly metabolised , as sole nitrogen sources , while all the remaining proteinogenic amino acids are taken up by M . tuberculosis , but are not utilised as sole nitrogen sources . This accumulation indicates that M . tuberculosis metabolic network is adapted to uptake all amino acids , but not necessarily utilise their carbon and nitrogen atoms . For example , M . tuberculosis genome lacks genes commonly utilised to degrade histidine , tryptophan , tyrosine and phenylalanine ( Cole et al . , 1998 ) . The α amino group from these amino acids could in theory be transferred and serve as a nitrogen source , however as M . tuberculosis cannot catabolise the residual α-keto acid this would likely lead to their intracellular accumulation which in turn would acidify the cytosol , in addition to affect other cellular processes . In contrast , the inability to extract nitrogen from valine , isoleucine and threonine cannot be easily explained , as these amino acids can be degrade or re-routed . Likely the overall architecture of the nitrogen metabolic network , kinetic properties of each of its enzymes , and actual pool size of its key metabolites has a dominant effect on directionality of reactions and actual metabolic flux . One of the most important results we obtained is that several amino acids are superior nitrogen sources , compared to NH4+ . These results indicate that the vast majority of studies carried out to date on nitrogen metabolism of M . tuberculosis using NH4+ as sole nitrogen source are likely not relevant to physiologic conditions found in the host . More emphasis should be put into microbiological research with amino acids and complex mixtures , as oppose to NH4+ , as sole nitrogen sources . Of note , similar experiments carried out with NH4+ in E . coli ( doubling time ~once per 20 min ) revealed first-order labelling rates of 14 . 9 , 0 . 8 , >1 . 6 and 2 . 8 min−1 for Gln , Glu , Ala and Asp , respectively ( Yuan et al . , 2006 ) . Our results with M . tuberculosis , which doubles every 20 hr , and NH4+ are: 9 . 5 × 10−3 , 3 . 7 × 10−3 , 7 . 5 × 10−3 and 3 . 5 × 10−3 min−1 for Gln , Glu , Ala and Asp , respectively . These labelling rates are approximately 1500- , 216- , >213- , and 800-fold slower than in E . coli . Therefore , it seems that E . coli takes and utilises nitrogen from NH4+ between 3- and 26-fold faster , taking into account the doubling rate . Labelling of Glu , Gln , Asp , Asn , Ala and GABA in amino acids as sole nitrogen sources is up to 10-times faster than in NH4+as sole nitrogen source , which supports our hypothesis that M . tuberculosis has evolved to utilise preferentially host amino acids as nitrogen sources , and to a lesser extent NH4+ . Nitrogen sources containing more than one nitrogen atom , such as Gln and Asn , were for the first time evaluated with respect to the mobilisation of individual nitrogen atoms . This can only be directly investigated using position-specific labelled Gln and Asn . Our metabolomics results reveal that both nitrogen atoms from Gln and Asn are utilised by M . tuberculosis . This result is not easily predicted , as the ability of these to serve as a sole nitrogen sources cannot be deduced from growth kinetics alone . In fact , analysis of position-specific nitrogen utilisation reveals how misleading growth kinetics alone might be as surrogate of uptake/utilization of nutrients . Both Glu and Asp , containing a single nitrogen atom , lead to greater biomass , than Gln and Asn , containing two nitrogen atoms . Kinetic analysis of nitrogen metabolism employing 15N-labelled single nitrogen sources ( Gln , Glu , Asn , Asp and Ala ) reveals that M . tuberculosis metabolic network appears to be highly evolved to use very well a number of nitrogen sources , despite M . tuberculosis ability to biosynthesise all amino acids . All nitrogen sources tested are able to ‘donate’ their nitrogen atoms relatively fast , compared to NH4+ . Co-metabolism of nitrogen sources has never been directly evaluated in any mycobacteria , and only modestly explored in other bacteria . Employing a 15N-labelled nitrogen source in combination with a 14N-containing nitrogen source , we demonstrate that at least Glu/Gln and Asp/Asn are simultaneously used by M . tuberculosis . As we have suggested for carbon sources ( de Carvalho et al . , 2010 ) , this is a characteristic that is likely important during growth under low nutrient levels , such as when M . tuberculosis is found in nutrient-restricted reservoirs intra- or extracellularly . Co-metabolism must lead to a more compartmentalised/optimised used of the metabolic network . Contrary to the results obtained with carbon sources which clearly indicate an advantage of co-metabolism , no growth advantage ( doubling-rate and final biomass ) is observed with the combined nitrogen sources tested . Of interest , Ala appears to be labelled faster than Glu , using a number of sole nitrogen sources . This behaviour could not be expected or explained based on our current understanding of M . tuberculosis metabolism . Employing ald knockout and complemented strains , labelled nitrogen sources , and inhibitors of key nitrogen metabolic enzymes we show that this behaviour is likely due to the reversal of reaction catalysed by alanine dehydrogenase ( reductive amination of pyruvate ) . Our data also reveal that alanine dehydrogenase is absolutely essential for utilisation of Ala as sole nitrogen source , in agreement with the result from Giffin et al . ( 2012 ) . Given that the Ala pool size dramatically increases during growth in NH4+ and in Gln , but the enzyme is not essential for growth in NH4+ and in Gln as sole nitrogen source it is likely that Ala represents a quickly accessible route to store nitrogen in M . tuberculosis . Nitrogen is thought to ‘freely’ move between molecules once it has been assimilated into Gln and Glu . The latter , is thought to be able to donate its nitrogen atom via a number of transaminases encoded in the genome . Our data does not support such an unregulated and freely reversible exchange . Although transamination reactions are usually fast and have equilibrium constants close to unit , large disparities in the pool sizes of amino acids and related α-keto acids likely impart a single viable direction of nitrogen flow . For example , alanine dehydrogenase is not essential for Ala biosynthesis in M . tuberculosis , given that the ald knockout strain is not an Ala auxotroph . This supports the existence and functioning of a bona fide glutamate/pyruvate transaminase in M . tuberculosis and/or the presence of another alanine synthesising pathway/enzyme which can provide enough Ala to support cell wall and protein biosynthesis . Our data unambiguously demonstrates that Ala cannot donate its nitrogen to α-KG , producing Glu and pyruvate . If this is true for other transaminases , it would indicate that Glu is the source of nitrogen for transaminations in M . tuberculosis , but only made from glutamate synthase and/or glutamate dehydrogenase , instead of by transamination of amino acids and α-KG . Consequently , amino acids that do not possess alternative enzymatic systems able to remove the α nitrogen , such as dehydrogenases , will likely not serve as nitrogen sources . Together , these results reveal a number of cellular and molecular details about nitrogen metabolism in M . tuberculosis which have escaped detection over the last few decades . Some of these behaviours and characteristics are unique and are likely the results of tens of thousands of years of adaptation to optimise grow and persist in humans as the sole or principal natural reservoir . This extreme ecologic adaptation appears to have shaped M . tuberculosis into an ‘opportunistic’ nutritional generalist . That is , M . tuberculosis is able to synthesise every molecule required for its survival but also able to uptake and metabolise a number of different carbon and nitrogen sources from the host . The ability of M . tuberculosis to uptake and utilise a number of proteinogenic amino acids as nitrogen sources likely makes nitrogen uptake an uninviting target for the development of novel antitubercular agents . On the other hand , the ability of M . tuberculosis to uptake amino acids which cannot serve as nitrogen sources and might be toxic will likely teach us the true biochemical and metabolic constraints of this pathogen , some of which might find application in drug discovery . 4 Materials and methods M . tuberculosis H37Rv was used for growth and metabolic studies .

While a single course of vaccines will protect someone against polio or measles for their whole life , people need a new flu shot every year to be protected against influenza . Also , some years the flu vaccine is not as effective as hoped because the virus has changed in an unpredictable way . All of the change that happens in flu viruses around the world ultimately begins in individual infections , as random mistakes or mutations in the virus’s genetic material that arise as the viruses replicate . Mutations that help the virus aid in its ability to spread from person to person , and eventually spread around the world . As such , understanding flu’s evolution within individual people may help scientists to understand and eventually predict how it changes worldwide . Yet , unlike some viral infections that last months or years , flu infections are usually short and over in a few days . This makes it harder to measure how the viruses change over time in a single infection . To get around this issue , Xue et al . analyzed flu samples taken over several weeks from four cancer patients who had longer-than-average flu infections because of their weaker immune systems . In some cases , the exact same mutations were seen in viruses from two or more of the patients . Also , some of the mutations that happened within the patients were the same mutations that later went on to spread around the world . These findings show that the flu virus can change in a single person in some of the same ways that it has been seen to change around the world . Xue et al . studied how flu changes in people with weak immune systems , who are infected for longer periods of time . Further studies are needed to reveal more about how flu viruses evolve in the more typical , shorter infections in otherwise healthy people . This kind of investigation is becoming easier because new methods are making it possible to examine the genetic material from many viruses at once . It is hoped that eventually , detecting mutations in individual infections could help predict how viruses will change worldwide , which might help researchers to design vaccines that will be more effective each year .", "article": "1 Introduction Viruses rapidly acquire de novo mutations as they replicate within infected hosts ( Andino and Domingo , 2015 ) , but only a small fraction of these variants transmit between hosts and eventually fix on a global scale . Within hosts , a mutation’s impact on viral replication and immunogenicity affect whether it increases in frequency . At larger scales of space and time , transmission bottlenecks ( Varble et al . , 2014; Poon et al . , 2016 ) and host heterogeneity also shape viral genetic diversity . The selective pressures at these various scales reflect complex molecular , immunological , and epidemiological constraints ( Grenfell et al . , 2004; Pybus and Rambaut , 2009; Luksza and Lässig , 2014; Neher et al . , 2016 ) , which have formed the basis of recent efforts to forecast influenza evolution ( Luksza and Lässig , 2014; Neher et al . , 2016 , Neher et al . , 2014; Lässig et al . , 2017 ) . Influenza’s rapid global evolution has been the subject of intense study ( Ghedin et al . , 2005; Rambaut et al . , 2008 ) , but the origins of this variation within single infected hosts are still poorly understood . Recent deep-sequencing studies of human clinical samples suggest that influenza accumulates relatively limited genetic diversity within hosts during most acute infections ( Dinis et al . , 2016; Poon et al . , 2016; Sobel Leonard et al . , 2016; Debbink et al . , 2017 ) , in line with earlier studies in dogs and horses ( Murcia et al . , 2010; Hoelzer et al . , 2010 ) . Some within-host mutations may confer novel antigenic properties ( Dinis et al . , 2016 ) , but most lack clear functional interpretation . Altogether , it remains unclear how influenza’s within-host diversity is transformed into global evolution . Influenza infections usually last less than a week and provide limited opportunity for longitudinal study . But among some immunocompromised patients , infections can last weeks or months ( Nichols et al . , 2004; Memoli et al . , 2014 ) , making it possible to examine longer-term within-host evolutionary dynamics ( Rocha et al . , 1991; McMinn et al . , 1999; Rogers et al . , 2015 ) . Here , we use deep-sequencing to characterize the evolutionary dynamics of influenza within immunocompromised hosts . We identify a small set of mutations that arise repeatedly within individual patients , across multiple patients in our study , and at the global scale , revealing surprising similarities in evolutionary dynamics across multiple spatiotemporal scales . 2 Results We deep-sequenced 37 viral samples collected longitudinally from four immunocompromised patients with long-term H3N2 influenza infections in the 2005–2006 and 2006–2007 seasons ( Figure 1 ) . These patients developed influenza infections in the months after receiving hematopoietic cell transplantations when immune cell counts were still low , and nasal wash samples were collected approximately every week . All patients were treated with the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir for at least some duration of their infections ( Campbell et al . , 2015 ) ( Figure 1 , Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 26875 . 003Figure 1 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 26875 . 004 We sequenced the full viral genome to high coverage directly from patient nasal wash samples by using influenza-specific reverse transcription and PCR ( Hoffmann et al . , 2001 ) to enrich for viral genetic material ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) . To limit the impact of library preparation and sequencing errors on estimates of variant frequency ( McCrone and Lauring , 2016 ) , we prepared sequencing libraries in duplicate for each sample , beginning from separate reverse-transcription reactions . We excluded from downstream analyses eight low-quality samples for which sequencing coverage was low or variant frequencies differed greatly between replicates ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) . Across the influenza genome , de novo mutations arise most commonly in the surface proteins hemagglutinin ( HA ) and neuraminidase ( NA ) ( Figure 2A ) , which undergo rapid global evolution ( Bhatt et al . , 2011 ) . These mutations fluctuate in frequency but rarely fix , showing that complex evolutionary dynamics can emerge within single infected individuals ( Figure 2B , Figure 2—figure supplements 2–5 ) . We focused on within-host mutations that reached a frequency of at least 5% in two independent sequencing replicates from any patient sample . Many nonsynonymous mutations occur at sites that affect the antigenicity of HA ( Koel et al . , 2013 ) and the antiviral sensitivity of NA ( Baz et al . , 2006; van der Vries et al . , 2013 ) ( Figure 2—figure supplement 6 ) . In NA in particular , we observe the emergence and persistence of mutations T242I and R292K , which are known to be associated with oseltamivir resistance ( Baz et al . , 2006; van der Vries et al . , 2013 ) , a phenomenon of strong clinical importance ( Renaud et al . , 2011 ) ( Figure 2—figure supplements 2–5 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 26875 . 005Figure 2 .

( A ) Distribution of unique variable sites when sites are drawn at random along the full length of the indicated gene , matching the number of variants empirically observed in each patient . These simulations test a simple null model in which each site in the gene is equally likely to mutate . We calculated the number of unique sites of mutation in each simulation as a metric of parallelism: fewer unique sites means that more parallel mutation has occurred . The p-value indicates the proportion of 100 , 000 simulations in which the number of unique sites is less than or equal to what is empirically observed . ( B ) Distribution of overlapping sites for simulations as described in ( A ) , but with a constrained null model in which the fraction of sites considered mutable is the fraction that shows at least two instances of nonsynonymous mutation in the global H3N2 influenza population between 2000 and 2015 ( see Materials and methods ) to account for constraints on protein evolution . For both HA and NA , the observed overlap of mutations between patients is statistically significant under this set of constraints . ( C ) p-values as described in ( A ) , calculated across a range of constraints on the fraction of mutable sites . The constrained null model indicated in ( B ) is indicated with a red arrow . For both HA and NA , the observed parallelism is statistically significant at a threshold of 0 . 05 unless it is assumed that fewer than 15% of the sites in HA or 35% of the sites in NA are mutable . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 26875 . 013 In several cases , the same mutations arise independently and reach high frequency in multiple patients ( Figure 2C ) . We identified nine sites in the influenza genome where parallel mutations arose in two or more patients in our study: five in HA , three in NA , and one in the nonstructural ( NS ) segment ( Figure 2C , Figure 2—figure supplement 7; HA: p<0 . 001; NA: p<0 . 01; permutation test ) . In subsequent analyses , we focused primarily on HA because of its prominent role in antigenic evolution ( Koel et al . , 2013 ) . Although the same HA mutations arise in multiple patients , we found that evolutionary outcomes sometimes diverge . For instance , A138S arises in patients W and Z , but it fixes only in patient Z . In three patients , N225D reaches a detectable frequency , but it fixes only in patient X ( Figure 2C ) . We suspected that the complex dynamics of these within-host mutations might arise from competition among mutant lineages . The influenza genome consists of eight linear segments that freely re-assort with one another but do not recombine ( Boni et al . , 2008 ) , meaning that each segment evolves clonally . In the absence of homologous recombination , lineages carrying beneficial mutations rise and fall in frequency as they compete with one another , making it harder for any one variant to fix . This phenomenon , known as clonal interference , has been characterized extensively in experimental evolution ( Hegreness et al . , 2006; Kao and Sherlock , 2008; Lang et al . , 2013; Neher , 2013 ) and affects influenza’s global evolution ( Strelkowa and Lässig , 2012 ) . We examined clonal dynamics within individual patients by analyzing patterns of linkage among within-host mutations . We identified read pairs that spanned multiple variable sites to infer linkage , and we summarized these relationships as haplotypes: for instance , ‘0000’ represents ancestral residues at four variable sites , and ‘1100’ represents a double-mutant at the first two sites ( Figure 3A ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 26875 . 014Figure 3 . Parallel emergence of the same mutations within single infected hosts . ( A ) Method for inferring partial haplotypes from short-read sequencing data . We identified paired-end reads that spanned multiple sites of interest along a gene and determined whether the read carried the ancestral or derived allele at each site . ( B ) Frequencies of haplotypes at HA sites 193 and 225 in patient X . Evolutionary paths from the ancestral to double-mutant state are shown , with haplotypes colored according to their maximum frequency during the infection . Solid black lines connect pairs of haplotypes that are both present at a frequency of above 1% and that unambiguously occurred through the indicated mutation . Dashed lines indicate that multiple mutations could have produced a particular haplotype . Gray lines indicate that a mutation did not arise at a detectable frequency on a particular haplotype background . ( C ) Frequencies of haplotypes at HA sites 138 , 193 , 223 , and 225 in patient W . Figure 3—figure supplement 1 estimates the rate of PCR recombination as described in Materials and methods . Figure 3—figure supplement 2 and 3 show the number of paired-end reads that spanned the mutations in the haplotypes in patients X and W .

The total frequency of all recombinant haplotypes and the frequency of the single most common recombinant haplotype are shown as a function of distance from the haplotype start . We mixed equal volumes of extracted RNA from the first influenza-positive nasal washes from patients W and X and prepared replicate libraries for sequencing as described in Materials and methods . In the absence of PCR recombination , all haplotypes should consist entirely of bases from one or the other original sample: for instance , 00000000 or 11111111 . Based on sequencing of the unmixed samples from patients W and X , we identified eight sites of fixed differences within a 200 bp region of the HA gene , and we inferred haplotypes in the mixture sample at these eight sites . Beginning at the first haplotype site , we tallied the proportion of haplotypes that had experienced recombination by each successive site in the haplotype . We did not seek to distinguish between PCR recombination and sequencing errors: the haplotypes 00100000 and 00111111 were both recorded as having experienced recombination by the third haplotype site . The maximum-frequency recombinant haplotype never exceeded 3 . 5% of the total haplotypes .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 26875 . 017 In several instances , the same mutations arise in parallel on distinct genetic backgrounds within the same patient—echoing our observation that these same mutations arise in parallel in multiple patients in our study . In patient X , lineages carrying S193Y and N225D initially compete , but a double-mutant carrying both mutations eventually fixes ( Figure 3B ) . The A138S and F193Y mutations also arise multiple times in parallel in patient W: once on the ancestral haplotype ‘0000’ to form the single-mutant ‘1000’ and ‘0100’ lineages; once on these single-mutant lineages to form the double-mutant ‘1100’; and once on the double-mutant ‘0011’ to form the triple-mutant ‘1011’ and ‘0111’ lineages ( Figure 3C ) . These recurrent mutations also contribute to the large number of clonal lineages present . Several weeks into patient W’s infection , we observe at least five distinct HA lineages at a frequency of at least 5% , and the lineages differ from each other by one to three nonsynonymous mutations ( Figure 3C ) . Eventually , all lineages that carry A138S , V223I , and N225D are outcompeted by a lineage that carries F193Y . Our analysis shows that in large , clonally evolving influenza populations within hosts , a small set of beneficial mutations repeatedly arise and compete against one another in various combinations . Although many of these beneficial mutations are selected in parallel in multiple patients , the unpredictability of clonal competition determines which mutations eventually fix . We compared viral mutations that arose within our patients and at the global scale . Strikingly , many of the HA mutations that arise in parallel in multiple patients in our study also reach a high global frequency , which may reflect concordant antigenic selection at the within-host and global scales . We identified all variants that reached a frequency of at least 10% in any given year after 2000 in the GISAID database of global influenza sequences ( Bogner et al . , 2006 ) and compared them to variants that we identified in the patients in our study . In HA , most sites that varied within hosts also varied in the global influenza population , compared to about a quarter of such sites in the other influenza genes ( Figure 4 ) . We tested whether this overlap between sites of variation within patients and globally was greater than expected by chance for HA , NA , and the rest of the viral genome combined . We calculated the expected overlap when the observed number of within-host and global variants were drawn at random from each gene ( Figure 4—figure supplements 1–2 ) . Not all sites are expected to tolerate mutation , so we also performed simulations where we only considered sites for which there was variation in human H3N2 influenza globally between 2000 and 2015: for instance , in HA about 25% of codon sites show no variation within the GISAID database . We found significant parallelism in HA ( p<0 . 01 ) , but not in NA or in the rest of the genome ( p>0 . 05 ) when we consider all sites of global variation . This parallelism in HA evolution remains statistically significant at a 0 . 05 threshold until we assume that less than 50% of HA codon sites tolerate variation . 10 . 7554/eLife . 26875 . 018Figure 4 .

( A ) Distribution of overlapping sites when two sets of sites are drawn at random along the full length of the indicated gene or genes , matching the number of unique variable sites empirically observed in each patient and in the global influenza population ( see Materials and methods ) . These simulations test a simple null model in which each site is equally like to mutate .

For HA , but not NA or the other influenza genes in aggregate , the observed overlap of mutations at the within-host and global scales is statistically significant under this set of constraints . ( C ) p-values as described in ( A ) , calculated across a range of constraints on the fraction of mutable sites . The constrained null model indicated in ( B ) is indicated with a red arrow .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 26875 . 021 The parallelism is especially striking at the sites of HA mutations found in multiple patients in our study . In particular , four of the five sites of recurrent within-host mutation in HA are also sites of global influenza variation ( Figure 4 , Figure 4—source data 1 ) . The V223I and N225D mutations arise in multiple patients , and then fix globally in the decade after the patient infections ( Figure 4D ) . Mutations also reach high global frequencies at sites 138 and 193 , although the F193 and S193 variants that spread globally differ from the Y193 variant that arises within our patients . However , the concordance is incomplete . Mutation L427F reaches a frequency of >75% in three patients but is rare or nonexistent in influenza globally ( Figure 4D ) , suggesting that this mutation may have within-host benefits that are not reflected in global evolution . But overall across hemagglutinin , within-host variants tend to arise at sites that vary on the global scale . 3 Discussion It is remarkable that influenza evolution shows such extensive parallelism at these disparate spatiotemporal scales despite heterogeneity in host immunity , viral genetic background , and the severity and duration of infection . In particular , the immunocompromised patients in our study had complex underlying conditions and diverse immune histories . Notably , the four HA sites that displayed parallel within-host and global evolution in our study ( 138 , 193 , 223 , and 225 ) also gave rise to mutations in another study that used Sanger sequencing to analyze laboratory-passaged influenza isolated longitudinally from an immunocompromised child ( Baz et al . , 2006 ) . Another previous study used hemagglutination inhibition assays to show that antigenic drift of influenza within an immunocompromised patient resembled global antigenic change ( McMinn et al . , 1999 ) . These similarities further support our finding that influenza evolution shows parallelism across diverse patients . The parallel evolution that we observe in influenza at the within-host and global scales contrasts with HIV , where similar mutations can arise within hosts that share an HLA type , but tend to revert upon transmission to recipients with different HLA types ( Leslie et al . , 2004; Herbeck et al . , 2006; Lemey et al . , 2006; Zanini et al . , 2015 ) . Part of the difference may be that immune epitopes in influenza are broadly similar among individuals , with some exceptions ( Li et al . , 2013; Linderman et al . , 2014 ) , whereas the targets of anti-HIV immunity vary more widely due to patient-specific factors like HLA type . We suggest that parallelism in HA evolution may emerge from the confluence of several evolutionary conditions ( Lässig et al . , 2017 ) . First , if selection acts concordantly across environments , it will favor a common set of beneficial mutations . Second , in a constrained evolutionary landscape , this set of beneficial mutations will be relatively small . Finally , given sufficiently large population sizes , high mutation rates , and time , these beneficial mutations will emerge and be selected to detectable frequencies . Our observation that similar mutations arise repeatedly within single patients , within multiple different patients , and at the global scale , suggests that at least some of these conditions may hold true . The parallelism and extensive evolution that we observe in long-term influenza infections contrasts with the limited within-host variation found in prior studies , which sample from acute infections of immunocompetent hosts ( Murcia et al . , 2010; Hoelzer et al . , 2010; Dinis et al . , 2016; Debbink et al . , 2017; Sobel Leonard et al . , 2016; Poon et al . , 2016 ) . For instance , one recent study deep-sequenced HA from several hundred patients but only found a small number of antigenic variants , and mostly at low frequencies ( Dinis et al . , 2016 ) . But our study suggests that influenza may experience many of the same selective pressures within acute infections as it does globally , even if the short durations of these infections make it difficult for selected mutations to reach frequencies that are detectable with current methods . We suggest that within-host viral diversity may act as a noisy early measurement of global viral evolution , shaped by some of the same immunological and evolutionary constraints . As high-throughput sequencing continues to improve , detailed characterization of within-host variation will be increasingly valuable for understanding how molecular , immunological , and epidemiological forces interact to shape viral evolution . 4 Materials and methods Samples were prospectively collected during a surveillance study for respiratory viruses performed in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HCT ) recipients undergoing transplantation between December 2005 and February 2010 at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center ( Campbell et al . , 2015 ) . Following written informed consent , weekly nasal wash samples ( or nasopharyngeal swabs if nasal wash samples were precluded clinically ) and oropharyngeal swab specimens were obtained at least once before and weekly after HCT up to 100 days . Afterwards , samples were collected as long as the patients continued to test positive for respiratory viruses , if they developed new symptoms , or at least every three months until one year post-transplantation . Nasal wash samples were collected using 5 mL of saline per nostril , and combined with oropharyngeal swabs for real-time PCR testing for a panel of 12 respiratory viruses , including influenza A and B . Samples were considered positive if the assay’s cycle threshold was less than 40 , for a limit of detection of approximately 2000 viral copies/mL . All samples sequenced in this study tested positive for influenza A . The timing of each sample during an infection was calculated as the number of days since the first influenza-positive nasal wash for that patient . Descriptions of individual patients and their clinical courses are summarized below , with detailed information in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 . All patients were severely immunocompromised: although their influenza infections occurred after transplant engraftment , their lymphocyte counts remained well below those found in immunocompetent individuals , and they were concurrently treated with immunosuppressive medications . Influenza sometimes co-occurred with other respiratory viruses , and the patients were frequently taking multiple antiviral and antibiotic medications at any given point in the infection . To deep-sequence viral populations , we extracted bulk RNA from nasal wash samples using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit ( QIAGEN ) according to manufacturer’s instructions . Where possible , we extracted RNA from 560 μL of sample , the maximum volume recommended for use with the QIAamp kit , to capture as much viral diversity as possible . To amplify the influenza genome , we modified the primers designed by Hoffmann et al . ( 2001 ) for full-length amplification of the influenza A genome ( Figure 2—source data 1 ) . We performed reverse transcription using Superscript III First-Strand Reaction Mix ( Thermo Fisher ) and an equimolar mix of the 5’-Hoffmann-U12-A4 and 5’-Hoffmann-U12-G4 primers , which bind to the conserved U12 region present on each influenza gene segment . To 6 μL RNA eluent , we added 1 μL annealing buffer and 1 μL of 2 uM primer mix , then incubated at 65 degrees C for 5 min . We added 10 μL 2X First-Strand Reaction Mix and 2 μL Superscript III/RNaseOUT Enzyme Mix on ice for a 20 μL total reaction volume , then incubated at 25 degrees C for 10 min ( this initial incubation is designed to help with the binding of short primers ) , 50 degrees C for 50 min , and 85 degrees C for 5 min . We used the entire 20 μL volume of the reverse-transcription reaction as template in a 100 μL PCR reaction using KOD HotStart Reaction Mix ( EMP Millipore ) and a 24-primer cocktail as described in Figure 2—source data 1 at a total concentration of 600 nM . We performed 35 cycles of PCR amplification with an annealing temperature of 55 degrees C and an extension time of 3 min . We purified the PCR product using 1X AMPure beads ( Beckman Coulter ) and prepared libraries for Illumina sequencing using Nextera XT ( Illumina ) . We sequenced the libraries on a NextSeq 500 platform ( Illumina ) with 150 bp paired-end reads . We performed library preparation and sequencing in duplicate , starting from independent reverse-transcription reactions . We first used bowtie2 ( Langmead and Salzberg , 2012 ) to filter out reads that mapped to the human genome . Remaining reads are available in the SRA as BioProject PRJNA364676 . We used cutadapt 1 . 8 . 3 ( Martin , 2011 ) to trim adapter sequences from the remaining reads , remove bases at the ends of reads with a Q-score below 25 , and filter out reads whose remaining length was shorter than 20 bases . We locally aligned trimmed reads to the A/Brisbane/10/2007 ( H3N2 ) genome ( Genbank accessions CY035022 to CY035029 ) using bowtie2 ( Langmead and Salzberg , 2012 ) and tallied the counts of each base at each genome position using custom scripts . We discarded reads with a mapping score below 20 , as well as bases with a Q-score below 20 . We calculated average sequencing coverage in 50 bp bins along the viral genome . Because we prepared sequencing libraries using Nextera tagmentation , we expect coverage to be low at the two ends of the eight viral gene segments , corresponding to 16 bins . We discarded samples with more than 16 bins with average coverage below 200x ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1A ) . We also identified sites at which a non-consensus base reached a frequency of at least 1% in both sequencing replicates and compared variant frequencies between replicates . We discarded samples for which the average difference between variant frequencies in the two replicates exceeded 0 . 05 ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1B ) . In total , we excluded eight samples from downstream analyses . The samples shown in Figure 1B are high-quality samples only . For each patient , we identified variable nucleotide sites in the viral genome . We defined these sites as positions with a sequencing coverage of at least 200x , at which multiple bases are present at a frequency of at least 5% in both replicate libraries . We used custom scripts to determine each variant’s codon position and whether it created a synonymous or nonsynonymous substitution . For each patient in our study , we determined the viral consensus sequence at the first sequenced time point . We also downloaded the set of 503 sequences in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data ( GISAID ) EpiFlu database ( Bogner et al . , 2006 ) corresponding to all full-length HA coding regions from human H3N2 influenza A isolates collected in the USA from January 1 , 2004 to December 31 , 2007 ( GISAID acknowledgement tables provided in Supplementary file 1 ) . We analyzed only sequences with passage annotation ‘Unpassaged , ’ ‘Original’ , or ‘P0 , ’ indicating that the strains were sequenced directly from the clinical isolates , leaving 63 unique sequences for phylogenetic inference . We pairwise aligned each sequence to the A/Brisbane/10/2007 ( H3N2 ) coding sequence ( Genbank accession CY035022 ) using the program needle from EMBOSS 6 . 6 . 0 ( Rice et al . , 2000 ) , which implements a Needleman-Wunsch alignment . We used RAxML 8 . 2 . 3 ( Stamatakis , 2014 ) to infer a phylogeny from this alignment using a GTRCAT codon-substitution model and visualized the tree using the R package ggtree ( Yu et al . , 2017 ) . We identified paired-end reads that spanned n variable sites of interest within a single gene and determined which bases were present at each variable site . We summarized this information as an n-digit binary haplotype , in which each digit represented one variable site , 0 represented the ancestral base , and 1 represented the derived base . We discarded reads that did not span all sites of interest , or that contained genotypes other than the most common derived base . We estimated the rate of PCR recombination as described in Figure 3—figure supplement 1 . In Figure 3—figure supplement 2 and Figure 3—figure supplement 3 , we show the number of paired-end reads used to infer the haplotypes in Figure 3 . To identify sites of global variation in influenza , we downloaded all sequences in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data ( GISAID ) EpiFlu database ( Bogner et al . , 2006 ) corresponding to all full-length influenza coding regions from human H3N2 influenza A isolates collected from January 1 , 2000 to December 31 , 2015 . Acknowledgement tables are provided as Supplementary file 1 . We pairwise aligned each sequence to the A/Brisbane/10/2007 ( H3N2 ) coding sequence ( Genbank accession CY035022 ) using the program needle from EMBOSS 6 . 6 . 0 ( Rice et al . , 2000 ) , which implements a Needleman-Wunsch alignment . We calculated the amino-acid distance of each sequence from the Brisbane/2007 reference and excluded outliers whose distance deviated significantly from the other sequences originating from that year , since these sequences may have been misannotated . We tallied the amino acids present at each codon position in each year , discarding sequences that contained indels , and we identified sites at which multiple amino acids were present at a frequency of at least 10% within a single year , or at which the consensus base changed from year to year . We sought to test the probability that the parallel emergence of mutations across multiple patients in our study was due to chance . We began with a simple null model in which all sites are equally likely to mutate , and we drew sites from each gene at random without replacement , matching the number of mutations observed in each patient . We calculated the number of unique sites of mutation among all four patients in this simulated data set , and we compared this distribution to the number of unique sites observed in our sequencing data: fewer unique sites of mutation indicates more parallelism ( Figure 2—figure supplement 7A ) . This null model is overly simplistic , since some sites in a protein experience more evolutionary constraint . To estimate this constraint , we limited the number of sites considered mutable to the sites that show at least two instances of nonsynonymous mutation in the global H3N2 population between 2000 and 2015 ( see Analysis of Global Variation ) ( Figure 2—figure supplement 7B ) . The p-values given in the main text are calculated under this more conservative null model . We also performed permutation tests for a range of possible proportions of mutable sites and calculated the fraction of simulations that matched or exceeded the amount of parallelism observed in our data ( Figure 2—figure supplement 7C ) . We used a similar approach to test whether the overlap of mutations observed within patients in our study and in the global flu population was likely to be due to chance . We drew two independent sets of sites from each gene at random without replacement , matching the total number of unique variable sites within all patients and the number of variable sites observed in the global population . We then calculated the overlap between these two sets of sites . We used the approach above to calculate the overlap under a simple null model in which all sites in the gene are equally like to mutate; a constrained null model in which the only mutable sites are ones that show nonsynonymous mutation between 2000 and 2015; and across a range of possible constraints ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2 ) .

Whereas most microbial infections of the brain result in severe illness or death , Toxoplasma gondii infections are usually asymptomatic . This is because the parasite has evolved the ability to exist within the brain by dampening the immune response . The parasite can therefore asymptomatically co-exist with its host for years – or even an entire lifetime . The strategy has proved so successful that up to one third of the world’s population is now thought to be infected with Toxoplasma gondii . While this persistence tends not to be a problem for most healthy individuals , dormant Toxoplasma gondii parasites can reactivate in individuals whose immune systems fail . This can result in life-threatening neurological disease . In pregnant women , Toxoplasma gondii parasites can also cross the placenta , which can trigger miscarriage or cause harmful disease in the newborn . To develop treatments for these cases of symptomatic disease , we need to understand how the parasite hides from the immune system in asymptomatic individuals . Mendez et al . have therefore leveraged a mouse model in which neurons injected with Toxoplasma gondii proteins ( Toxoplasma-injected neurons , or ‘TINs’ ) produce a green fluorescent protein . This enables the infected cells to be viewed under a microscope . Examining the mouse brains revealed that most TINs were located in two specific regions: the cortex and the striatum . The cortex is the brain’s outer layer of tissue . The striatum is a structure deep within the brain that helps regulate movement and responses to rewards . Both the cortex and the striatum contain different types of neurons . The results revealed that the proteins from the parasite were spread roughly equally among the various cell types , rather than targeting a specific subtype of neuron . Neurons close to TINs had slightly abnormal electrical activity , whereas the TINs themselves had highly abnormal activity . By eight weeks post-infection , however , the number of TINS had fallen by around 90% . This suggests that many neurons containing Toxoplasma protein are sick and dying , and that their altered electrical activity reflects this unhealthy state . Understanding how Toxoplasma parasites persist in the brain has the potential to reveal new targets for treating symptomatic infections . It could even provide new possibilities for targeting the inflammation that drives many other neurological diseases . Harnessing this potential will require finding out why Toxoplasma gondii infects specific brain regions and why most neurons that directly interact with the parasite die .", "article": "1 Introduction A select number of highly divergent microbes ( e . g . , measles virus , Toxoplasma gondii ) naturally cause infections of neurons within the central nervous system ( CNS ) . Most of these viruses cause debilitating disease or death , whereas alphaherpes viruses and the eukaryotic parasite Toxoplasma primarily establish persistent , relatively quiescent neuronal infections in the immunocompetent host ( Dubey , 2009 ) . While neuron-alphaherpes virus interactions have been studied for decades—leading to a mechanistic understanding of herpes virus latency in neurons and the development of novel tools for circuit tracing—our understanding of neuron-Toxoplasma interactions is just beginning ( Ugolini , 1995; Wickersham et al . , 2007 ) . Toxoplasma is a ubiquitous intracellular parasite that can infect a wide range of warm-blooded hosts , including birds , rodents , and humans . In most immunocompetent hosts , Toxoplasma establishes a long-term , asymptomatic infection in specific organs . In humans and rodents , the CNS is a major organ of persistence and is the organ most affected by symptomatic disease in immunocompromised patients ( Remington and Cavanaugh , 1965; Luft and Remington , 1992; Dubey , 2009; Neu et al . , 2015 ) . Using a Cre-based mouse model in which host cells injected with Toxoplasma protein permanently express a green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) , our group showed that Toxoplasma predominantly interacts with neurons , not glia , in vivo ( Koshy et al . , 2012; Cabral et al . , 2016 ) . In addition , we determined that neurons injected with Toxoplasma protein outnumber cysts by over 20-fold ( Koshy et al . , 2012 ) , suggesting that far more neurons interact with Toxoplasma than are persistently infected . Here , we continue to harness this Cre-based model to extend our understanding of the neuron-Toxoplasma interface . We leverage the high numbers of Toxoplasma-injected neurons ( TINs ) and the expression of GFP , which labels the full neuron , to carry out a systematic neuroanatomic mapping of TINs . These studies revealed that TINs are most commonly found within the cortex followed by the striatum and are rarely found in the cerebellum . Within the cortex and the striatum , we used immunofluorescent assays to determine if Toxoplasma preferentially interacts with specific neuron subtypes , finding instead that the lineage of TINs essentially mirrors regional neuron subtype abundance . Finally , we used single neuron patch clamping in ex vivo slices to compare the electrophysiology of striatal TINs to neighboring ‘bystander’ neurons ( neurons within the same slice that were not injected with Toxoplasma proteins ) . These first-of-their-kind studies for any neurotropic microbe showed that TINs—but not bystander neurons—had dramatically altered electrophysiology . At 8 weeks post-infection ( wpi ) , the number of TINs drops by approximately 90% , suggesting this abnormal physiology reflects an unhealthy cellular state . Collectively , these data offer the first insights into which neurons interact with Toxoplasma and how these interactions—either directly or indirectly—alter neuron physiology and survival in vivo . 2 Results Prior work in AIDS patients and rodents suggested that Toxoplasma does not evenly distribute across the brain ( Post et al . , 1983; Lang et al . , 1989; Luft and Remington , 1992; Arendt et al . , 1999; Porter and Sande , 1992; Strittmatter et al . , 1992; Berenreiterová et al . , 2011; Evans et al . , 2014; Neu et al . , 2015; Dubey et al . , 2016 ) . These studies have conflicting findings as to where Toxoplasma lesions or cysts ( in rodent studies ) are predominantly found , differences that might be driven by the small numbers of patients or rodents analyzed ( Berenreiterová et al . , 2011; Evans et al . , 2014; Dubey et al . , 2016; Boillat et al . , 2020 ) . Given these conflicting studies , we sought to neuroanatomically map the location of TINs , a population that includes both uninfected , injected neurons and actively infected neurons ( Koshy et al . , 2012 ) . To accomplish this goal , we used our previously published semi-automated method ( Mendez et al . , 2018 ) which utilizes the Allen Institute Mouse Brain Atlas as a reference to quantify and map TINs quickly . This automation made it feasible to sample multiple brain sections per mouse across multiple cohorts of mice infected with either of two genetically distinct Toxoplasma strains ( type II— Prugniaud , type III—CEP ) that express a Toxoplasma:Cre fusion protein and mCherry ( Koshy et al . , 2010; Koshy et al . , 2012; Christian et al . , 2014 ) . For simplicity , from here forward , we will refer to these strains as II-Cre and III-Cre . We quantified TINs in 16–19 brain sections/mouse across 32 regions identified in the Allen Institute Mouse Brain Atlas . Data points were grouped into 12 major regions . For both II-Cre and III-Cre infected mice , the cortex contained the highest average number of TINs , followed by the striatum ( Figure 1A , B; Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . In general , III-Cre infected mice showed a higher overall number of TINs compared to II-Cre infected mice ( average of 247 . 5 III-Cre versus 216 . 7 II-Cre ) . The increase in absolute numbers in III-Cre infected mice was most pronounced in the cortex ( Figure 1A , B ) . Most other brain regions , including the cerebellum , contained relatively few TINs ( Figure 1A , B ) . As the cortex and striatum encompass a large proportion of the brain , the high number of TINs in these areas might be driven by relative size . To test this possibility , we produced an enrichment index using the following equation: RtinTtinRsize , where Rtin is the TIN count for a given region ( e . g . , cortex ) , Ttin is the total TIN count from an individual mouse , and Rsize is the total area percentage of a specific region ( e . g . , % of brain that is cortex ) ( see Supplementary file 1 for area percentage for each brain region ) . Our method of sectioning does not allow us to collect the smaller sections of the cerebellum , therefore we only included the cerebellar areas from sections 10-16 of the Allen atlas for normalization ( consistent with the regions of the cerebellum which were analyzed ) . To align our sections with the Allen Institute sections , we also excluded the olfactory bulb ( Mendez et al . , 2018 ) . Even with these exclusions , 85% of the original Allen atlas area was used . If the number of TINs in a region is proportional to the size of that region , the normalization index will approximate 1 , while regions enriched for TINs will have indices > 1 , and regions relatively devoid of TINs will have indices < 1 . Using this normalization , we determined that the cortex was the only region which was significantly enriched for TINs in both II-Cre and III-Cre infected mice ( index score 1 . 4 ± 0 . 1 and 2 . 2 ± 0 . 2 , respectively ) ( Figure 1C , D ) . For both groups of infected mice , within the cortex , the somatosensory , motor , and visual cortices had the highest enrichment score ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ) . Finally , two regions—the cerebellum and the white matter tracts—showed a significant lack of enrichment in both II-Cre and III-Cre infected mice ( Figure 1C , D ) . The lack of TINs in white matter tracts is expected given that these tracts are primarily made up of neuron axons and thus have a paucity of neuron nuclei , the cellular component by which neurons are anatomically mapped . Supplementary file 2 has the full list of enrichment scores and statistical analysis for the 12 listed regions . In summary , these data show that , irrespective of infecting Toxoplasma strain , TINs are commonly found in the cortex followed by the striatum and relatively rarely found in the cerebellum . While TINs localization in the striatum is consistent with its size , the enrichment of TINs in the cortex and lack of TINs in the cerebellum are not accounted for by the relative size of these regions . As the cortex and the striatum had the highest number of TINs , we decided to use these areas to determine if Toxoplasma targeted a specific neuron population . Neurons can be classified in many ways , including by neurotransmitter expression , physiology , and morphology . The simplest way is to classify neurons is as inhibitory or excitatory . Given that prior work suggested that Toxoplasma infection might specifically affect inhibitory neurons ( Brooks et al . , 2015 ) , we first examined how often TINs co-localized with two common markers for inhibitory interneurons , calbindin and parvalbumin . We chose these makers rather than the pan-inhibitory marker glutamate decarboxylase ( GAD ) [GAD+ interneurons make up approximately 15–20% of all cortical neurons ( Gentet et al . , 2000; Lodato and Arlotta , 2015 ) ] as GAD staining is altered in Toxoplasma-infected brain ( Brooks et al . , 2015; Carrillo et al . , 2020 ) . Fortunately , parvalbumin labels 40–50% of GAD+ interneurons and calbindin labels approximately 30% of GAD+ interneurons ( Hof et al . , 1999; Keller et al . , 2019 ) . To quantify how often TINs were calbindin or parvalbumin interneurons , we labeled brain sections with antibodies against either calbindin or parvalbumin , and with antibodies against NeuN , a pan-neuronal marker . These labeled sections were then imaged with confocal microscopy to identify TINs that co-stained with NeuN and either calbindin or parvalbumin . Within the cortex , irrespective of infecting strain , approximately 5% ( 4 . 8 ± 2 . 0% II-Cre , 3 . 9 ± 0 . 6% III-Cre ) of TINs were calbindin+ ( Figure 2A , B ) , while none were parvalbumin+ ( Figure 2C , D ) . In the striatum , we observed that approximately 4% of II-Cre TINs were calbindin+ ( 4 . 4 ± 2 . 0% ) and approximately 9% of III-Cre TINs were calbindin+ ( 9 . 4 ± 3 . 4% ) ( Figure 2E , F ) . As in the cortex , no TINs co-localized with parvalbumin+ neurons in the striatum ( N = 6–65 TINs/mouse , four mice for II-Cre; N = 30 and 84 TINs/mouse , two mice for III-Cre ) . These data suggest that Toxoplasma rarely interacts with or injects cortical or striatal interneurons , though we cannot exclude the possibility that Toxoplasma-injected interneurons die prior to the expression of GFP or that parasites primarily interact with interneurons that do not express parvalbumin or calbindin . Either scenario would limit our ability to detect these Toxoplasma-interneuron interactions . Within interneurons , Toxoplasma more commonly injects calbindin+ interneurons , not parvalbumin+ interneurons , an unexpected finding given the higher prevalence of parvalbumin+ interneurons . As only a small number of TINs co-localized with markers for inhibitory neurons , we next sought to determine if TINs co-localized with a marker for excitatory cortical neurons . For these studies , we selected the transcription factor FoxP2 . FoxP2 is primarily expressed by glutamatergic/excitatory neurons within layer 6 of the mouse cortex , though some FoxP2+ excitatory neurons are also found in cortical layers IV and V ( Arlotta et al . , 2005; Lodato and Arlotta , 2015 ) . FoxP2 expression also occurs in medium spiny neurons ( MSNs ) in the striatum , allowing us to use a single marker for both cortical and striatal studies ( Ferland et al . , 2003; Lai et al . , 2003 ) . We quantified how often TINs were FoxP2+ by labeling and imaging brain sections as above except now using antibodies directed against FoxP2 . Within the cortex , irrespective of infecting Toxoplasma strain , approximately 58% ( 58 . 0 ± 3 . 8% II-Cre , 58 . 3 ± 2 . 3% III-Cre ) of the analyzed TINs showed FoxP2 co-localization ( Figure 3A , B ) . In the striatum , we found that approximately 68% ( 68 . 1 ± 7 . 2% ) of analyzed II-Cre TINs and approximately 83% ( 83 ± 4 . 1% ) of analyzed III-Cre TINs showed FoxP2 co-localization ( Figure 3C , D ) . This high rate of co-localization between striatal TINs and FoxP2 suggested that striatal TINs were MSNs , which would be expected given that 90–95% of neurons in the striatum are MSNs ( Ouimet et al . , 1984; Ouimet and Greengard , 1990 ) . As the identification of striatal TINs as MSNs had important implications for pursuing electrophysiology studies , we sought to further confirm that striatal TINs were MSNs by determining the rate of co-localization between striatal TINs and DARPP32 , another marker for MSNs ( Ouimet et al . , 1984; Ouimet and Greengard , 1990 ) . We found that approximately 20% ( 19 . 9 ± 5 . 7% ) of II-Cre striatal TINs and approximately 25% ( 23 . 6 ± 4 . 8% ) of III-Cre striatal TINs co-localized with DARPP32+ staining ( Figure 3E , F ) . Given the relatively low percentage of TINs co-localizing with DARPP32 and prior work suggesting Toxoplasma infection alters protein localization and expression ( Cekanaviciute et al . , 2014; Brooks et al . , 2015; David et al . , 2016 ) , we sought to determine how striatal FoxP2 and DARPP32 staining differed between uninfected and infected mice , and if this staining differed by proximity to TINs . To determine the abundance of FoxP2 and DARPP32 neurons near TINs , we re-analyzed the images used for Figure 3 , this time quantifying the number of GFP- neurons ( NeuN+ cells ) that co-localized with FoxP2 or DARPP32 . To determine the abundance of FoxP2 and DARPP32 neurons regardless of proximity to TINs , we generated new , randomly distributed images from a subset of stained sections used for Figure 3 and quantified the co-localization between GFP- neurons and FoxP2 or DARPP32 . We found that the average number of FoxP2+ neurons in each image did not differ between images from either uninfected or infected mice , regardless of infecting Toxoplasma strain ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1A ) ; nor did the abundance vary in proximity to TINs ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1B ) . The average number of DARPP32+ neurons in each image also did not differ between random images from uninfected or infected mice ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1C ) . Conversely , in images taken in proximity to TINs , the number of DARPP32+ neurons showed a statistically significant decrease ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1D ) . In addition , we noted that , on average , more striatal neurons were FoxP2+ than DARPP32+ , even in uninfected mice ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1A , C ) . To further test the possibility that FoxP2 identifies more striatal neurons than DARPP32 , we stained tissues sections for both FoxP2 and DARPP32 and compared the co-localization between these proteins . Consistent with the findings in the single stains , only approximately 70% of FoxP2+ neurons stained for DARPP32 ( 69 . 6 ± 0 . 3% saline , 68 . 6 ± 0 . 6% II-Cre , 73 . 0 ± 4 . 0% III-Cre ) ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2A ) , while 99% ( 99 . 7 ± 0 . 0% saline , 99 . 8 ± 0 . 0% II-Cre , 99 . 8 ± 0 . 1% III-Cre ) of DARPP32+ neurons stained for FoxP2 ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2B ) . These data suggest that striatal TINs are likely MSNs as they co-localize with markers of MSNs , especially FoxP2 . The higher co-localization of TINs with FoxP2 versus DARPP32 is likely driven by the higher number of FoxP2+ neurons within the striatum as well as the sensitivity of DARPP32 expression/staining to disruption by infection or inflammation . Given that FoxP2 stains more striatal neurons than DARPP32 , even in uninfected mice , FoxP2 may be a more sensitive marker for striatal MSNs than DARPP32 . The identification of striatal TINs as co-localizing with markers for MSNs offered us an unusual opportunity . MSNs make up 90–95% of dorsal striatal neurons ( Mensah and Deadwyler , 1974; Graveland and DiFiglia , 1985; Gerfen , 1992 ) and are highly characterized , including at the level of single cell electrophysiology in situ ( i . e . , patch clamping in ex vivo slices ) . Targeting such a well-characterized , high-frequency population would allow us to directly compare the electrophysiology of TINs and bystander neurons—striatal neurons in proximity to a TIN but not injected with Toxoplasma protein—as both groups of neurons would likely be MSNs . We reasoned that comparing the physiology of TINs and bystanders would allow us to determine the role of general inflammation in driving any changes we observed in TINs ( i . e . , if TINs and bystanders showed similar physiologic changes , then these changes are likely driven by the general inflammatory response to Toxoplasma , not from direct manipulation of TINs by Toxoplasma effector proteins ) . For these studies , we chose to record from III-Cre infected mice because the type III strain produces an higher frequency of TINs than the type II strain ( Figure 1A ) , and because III-Cre TINs show higher rates of co-localization with the MSN marker FoxP2 ( Figure 3F ) . To ensure our capability to patch-clamp onto MSNs in ex vivo slices , we obtained thick brain slices from uninfected mice and performed patch clamping using a standard protocol ( Nisenbaum et al . , 1994; Suter et al . , 1999; Haubensak et al . , 2010; Wang et al . , 2019 ) . As expected , in uninfected mice , dorsal striatum neurons showed classical MSN electrophysiologic properties such as a hyperpolarized resting membrane potential of approximately −80 mV and a delayed first action potential ( AP ) ( Figure 4A ) . In addition , when we filled a neuron showing the above characteristics and stained the section for DARPP32 , we found the filled neuron co-localized with DARPP32 labeling ( Figure 4B–D ) . In infected mice , we electrophysiologically interrogated bystander MSNs and TINs , with bystander MSNs being approximately 30–100 µm from a TIN . Bystander MSNs had a resting membrane potential of −69 . 0 ± 1 . 2 mV , which is mildly depolarized compared to MSNs in uninfected mice ( Figure 5A , Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) . Consistent with a depolarized resting membrane potential , bystander MSNs required fewer steps of injected current to reach the threshold to fire the first AP compared to MSNs in uninfected mice ( 12 ± 0 . 3 steps for bystanders and 13 ± 0 . 4 for MSNs in uninfected mice ) ( Figure 5—figure supplement 2 ) . Besides these two properties , the following electrophysiologic properties were equivalent when comparing bystander MSNs to MSNs from uninfected mice: AP threshold , after hyperpolarization peak , AP amplitude , delay to first AP , and input resistance ( Figure 5B–G ) . These results indicate that though there is a mild change in the resting membrane potential of bystander MSNs during infection , the infected/inflammatory microenvironment at this time point causes relatively little change to neurons that have not directly interacted with Toxoplasma . We next evaluated TINs by following the same procedure as when we recorded from uninfected and bystander MSNs , except that we used the expression of GFP to identify the TIN ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1 ) . Unexpectedly , we were unable to properly patch onto most striatal TINs ( i . e . , we were unable to form a gigaseal ) . We were able to record from a total of 10 TINs , most of which had highly depolarized resting membrane potentials ( −49 . 1 ± 4 . 5 mV ) compared to either bystander or uninfected MSNs ( Figure 6A ) . None of these TINs generated APs in response to the standard protocol , possibly because this highly depolarized membrane potential is too close to the threshold for firing an AP ( ~45 mV ) in MSNs ( Figure 5B ) . Several possibilities could most easily explain this highly depolarized membraned potential: ( i ) the patched GFP+ cells were not neurons , ( ii ) the patched cells were dead neurons , or ( iii ) the patched cells were unhealthy neurons . To distinguish between these possibilities , when possible , we hyperpolarized the patched TINs , followed by attempts to generate APs . For five TINs , after we applied between −20 and −180 pA of negative current , membrane potentials of −55 to −66 mV were observed . With this ‘normalization’ of the resting membrane potential , we found that TINs could generate APs ( Figure 6B ) , definitively showing that they were neurons . Finally , to ensure the depolarized resting membrane potential of TINs was not due to fluorescent protein expression in the setting of inflammation , we recorded from YFP+ neurons in infected mice that constitutively express YFP in a subset of cortical neurons ( Feng et al . , 2000 ) . In these mice , we found a range of resting membrane potentials that is typical of cortical neurons ( Pangratz-Fuehrer and Hestrin , 2011; Oswald et al . , 2013 ) and distinct from the physiologic abnormalities observed in TINs ( Figure 6—figure supplement 2 ) . Given that such findings are consistent with the electrophysiology of sick or dying neurons ( Lipton , 1999 ) , we compared the total number of TINs in brain sections from mice infected with III-Cre parasites for 3 or 8 weeks . Consistent with the possibility that the electrophysiology reflects that TINs are sick/dying , brain sections from 8 wpi mice showed an approximately 90% reduction in the number of TINs compared to brain sections from three wpi mice ( Figure 7 ) . Collectively , our data suggest that neurons that directly interact with Toxoplasma have highly aberrant electrophysiology and most will die over a relatively short period . On the other hand , bystander neurons , which are in a similar inflammatory environment , show relatively minor changes in terms of electrophysiology . Together , these data suggest that neuron pathology is extremely targeted , even in a highly inflammatory setting . 3 Discussion In this study , we leveraged the Toxoplasma-Cre system to extend our understanding of neuron-Toxoplasma interactions . Across multiple cohorts of mice and using two genetically distinct Toxoplasma strains , our data show that TINs consistently localize to the cortex and striatum . For the cortex , the number of TINs is higher than would be expected even after accounting for the size of the cortex . Within the cortex and striatum , we found little evidence of Toxoplasma targeting a specific neuron subtype , as TINs co-localize with markers for highly abundant neurons in a region ( e . g . , MSNs in the striatum ) . Interestingly , when we used whole cell patch clamping in ex vivo slices to assess both striatal TINs and bystander MSNs , we found discrepant electrophysiology . Bystander MSNs showed mild changes in resting membrane potential and no changes in other passive firing properties , while TINs had highly depolarized resting membrane potentials and did not fire APs unless artificially hyperpolarized . These data suggest that TINs , but not bystanders , are unhealthy and potentially dying , a possibility confirmed by a drastic decrease in the number of TINs by 8 wpi . Together , these data offer an unprecedented look into the neuron-Toxoplasma interface , raising new questions about why the cortex is particularly vulnerable to Toxoplasma infection and the evolutionary advantage of the death of neurons injected with Toxoplasma protein . One of the major advances of this work is how we mapped neuron-Toxoplasma interactions . Most previous studies have utilized a single Toxoplasma strain , relatively few animals ( or more animals but relatively few sections/animal ) , and were limited to measuring cyst location . On the other hand , we mapped TINs , which outnumber cysts ( Koshy et al . , 2012 ) and show uniform distribution of GFP , allowing us to map neuron cell bodies/somas which is the traditional method for identifying neuron anatomic location . Furthermore , as our semi-automated method is relatively quick ( Mendez et al . , 2018 ) , in total , we mapped a total of over 5000 TINs/Toxoplasma strain , using multiple cohorts of mice and >15 sections/mouse . These robust methods offer confidence that our findings are not unduly influenced by a single outlier mouse , a cohort effect , or insufficient sampling for a process that is highly heterogenous . Our findings are consistent with several aspects of the two most extensive cyst mapping studies ( Berenreiterová et al . , 2011; Boillat et al . , 2020 ) . All three studies found: ( i ) high levels of inter-mouse variability; ( ii ) identified the cortex—and especially the motor , somatosensory , visual cortical regions—as showing enrichment for Toxoplasma presence ( TINs or cysts ) even when accounting for region size; and ( iii ) determined that the cerebellum shows relatively little Toxoplasma presence , especially when accounting for size . These consistencies suggest that regional cyst burden is driven by differences in the number of neuron-parasite interactions , not by differences in regional innate immune responses as has been suggested for West Nile virus ( WNV ) infection ( Cho et al . , 2013 ) . In addition , these regional differences are consistent with the largest studies in AIDS patients with toxoplasmic encephalitis , in which more lesions are identified in the cortex and the basal ganglia compared to the cerebellum ( Porter and Sande , 1992; Arendt et al . , 1999 ) , highlighting the relevance of the mouse model to human disease . Currently , we do not know what drives these regional differences in tropism , though one possibility is differences in the transmissibility of Toxoplasma across the vasculature that supplies the cortex and striatum/basal ganglia versus the cerebellum ( anterior versus posterior circulation , respectively ) , a possibility also suggested for WNV ( Daniels et al . , 2017 ) . A second advance in our study is the ability to identify the type of neuron injected by Toxoplasma . The finding that TINs are comprised of common neuron subtypes in the deep cortex and striatum ( e . g . , FoxP2+ neurons ) suggests that Toxoplasma injects ( and presumptively infects ) in proportion to the neuron subtypes in a given region . One exception to this rule is the lack of TINs that also express parvalbumin . Parvalbumin-expressing neurons make up approximately 40–50% of the cortical GABAergic ( inhibitory ) neurons and are found in all deeper layers of the cortex , while calbindin-expressing neurons are less frequent , especially in layers IV-VI of the cortex ( Hof et al . , 1999; Tremblay et al . , 2016 ) . One possibility for the lack of parvalbumin+ TINs is a decrease or change in parvalbumin expression/location as seen for DARPP-32 ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) or GAD-67 ( Brooks et al . , 2015 ) . Another more exciting possibility is that parvalbumin+ neurons have fewer interactions with Toxoplasma because they have a high concentration of perineural nets—extracellular matrix that surrounds different parts of the neuron ( Baker et al . , 2017 ) —blocking Toxoplasma’s ability to contact parvalbumin+ neurons . Another possibility is that parvalbumin+ neurons are highly sensitive to injection with Toxoplasma protein and rapidly die before expressing GFP and/or die prior to the time point at which we performed our studies . Future studies will define the factors that determine which neurons interact with parasites . A final advance in this work is the electrophysiology comparing TINs and bystander neurons . To the best of our knowledge , these studies are the first in any neurotropic infection to compare the in situ electrophysiology between microbe-interacted ( or infected ) neurons versus those neurons in close proximity but without direct microbial interactions . The utility of comparing TINs and bystanders is to address what physiologic effects are driven by the general neuroinflammatory response versus those changes driven by neuron-parasite interactions . Given the relatively common understanding that microglia will strip synapses off infected and uninfected neurons in the inflamed brain ( Vasek et al . , 2016; Di Liberto et al . , 2018 ) , we found it remarkable that bystander MSNs physiology showed only minor changes compared to MSNs from uninfected mice while TINs showed highly abnormal electrophysiology ( Figure 6 ) . One possible explanation for the minimal changes seen in bystanders is that these neurons undergo compensatory mechanisms that allow them to avoid drastically changing , as a dramatic response would be detrimental to the local circuitry . Another possibility is that the effect of the neuroinflammatory response is confined to a small area near TINs , leaving these more distant bystanders relatively spared . Either explanation would preserve circuit function at a global level and allow for a relatively quick reversal of these physiologic changes once the inflammatory response subsides . Of note , while the physiology of the bystanders is relatively normal compared to TINs , this depolarized resting membrane potential is still abnormal and the decrease in required input current ( Figure 6—figure supplement 2 ) suggests these neurons are mildly hyperexcitable . If similar changes also occur in other bystander neurons ( e . g . , cortical neurons ) and in other CNS infections , they might explain why patients with active brain infections have an increased likelihood of seizing ( Luft and Remington , 1992; Neu et al . , 2015 ) . These mild abnormalities might also summate across many bystander neurons to cause circuit level changes . While we did not test this possibility , such changes in the far more numerous bystanders—especially if the changes are reversible—could explain both the heterogeneity of behavioral changes seen in infected animals ( Worth et al . , 2014 ) and the relative lack of behavioral abnormalities observed in Toxoplasma-infected mice that have cleared both the infection and the immune response ( McGovern et al . , 2020 ) . TINs—which include actively infected neurons and uninfected , injected neurons ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) —show highly abnormal electrophysiology , only firing APs after artificial hyperpolarization . While we cannot distinguish between whether this abnormal physiology leads to neuron death or the sick state of these neurons drives the abnormal physiology ( we favor the latter possibility ) , the discrepancy between the physiology of TINs and bystanders suggests that the root cause is specific to neurons injected with Toxoplasma protein . Such restricted changes could arise from direct manipulation of TINs by the injected parasite proteins or selective microglial/macrophage recognition and phagocytosis of TINs , consistent with what was observed in lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection ( Di Liberto et al . , 2018 ) . Another possibility , as noted above , is that the immune response is tightly regulated and confined , such that the destruction leveled by this response is limited to a very small area around TINs . Such a possibility is consistent with prior work showing that partial abrogation of astrocytic TGF-β signaling led to de-regulation of the CNS immune response to Toxoplasma and higher levels of neuronal loss without changing the CNS parasite burden ( Cekanaviciute et al . , 2014 ) . Future studies will determine what factors drive this abnormal physiology . Finally , our finding of an approximately 90% decrease in TINs by 8 wpi suggests that we need to re-evaluate our understanding of how and why microbes persist in or even infect neurons . Microbes with the capability to infect multiple cell types are commonly found in neurons , not astrocytes ( e . g . , Toxoplasma , WNV , measles virus ) . This neuronal preference has been explained by the idea that—given the long-lived , relatively non-regenerative nature of neurons—neuron survival must be ensured at almost any cost . Thus , rather than initiating an immune response that might result in neuron death , neurons survive infection through non-cytolytic clearance of microbes ( Binder and Griffin , 2001; Patterson et al . , 2002; Samuel and Diamond , 2005; Miller et al . , 2016 ) and/or pushing the infecting microbes to enter a latent state ( Speck and Simmons , 1991; Ferguson and Hutchison , 1987; Tanaka et al . , 2016 ) . The death of TINs directly challenges this model , suggesting that the battle to persist in neurons is far more nuanced than previously recognized . For example , given that >90% of TINs are expected to be uninfected ( Koshy et al . , 2012 ) , we would predict that many uninfected neurons are dying . What is the advantage of uninfected , parasite-manipulated neurons dying ? One possibility is that these TINs are so abnormal ( from either direct manipulation by parasites or because of neuron-immune cell interactions ) that global brain function is better preserved with the removal of these neurons . Such a possibility is consistent with the altered gene expression identified in neurons that cleared an attenuated rabies virus infection ( Gomme et al . , 2012 ) . Another possibility is that the death of TINs—both infected and uninfected—is essential for parasite control and perhaps the death of uninfected TINs is simply collateral damage . Or the death of uninfected TINs might divert immune attention from the rare , persistently infected neuron . Regardless of whether this death benefits the host or microbe ( or both ) , based upon the data presented here and previously , we offer an alternative model for neuron-tropic microbes: neurons mount appropriate immune responses to both cytokines and infections such that persistent infection is a rare outcome , rather than a universal one . Limited data in a murine model of measles virus infection is consistent with this possibility ( Miller et al . , 2019 ) , though future studies using other neurotropic pathogens will be required to definitively determine how universal this model is . 4 Materials and methods Parasites were maintained via serial passage through human foreskin fibroblasts using DMEM supplemented with 2 mM glutagro , 10% fetal bovine serum , and 100 IU/ml penicillin/100 μg/ml streptomycin . The type II ( Prugniaud ) and type III ( CEP ) strains used have been engineered to express mCherry and Cre recombinase and have been previously described ( Koshy et al . , 2012; Christian et al . , 2014 ) . Most mice used in these studies are Cre-reporter mice that express GFP only after the cells have undergone Cre-mediated recombination ( Madisen et al . , 2010 ) . For Figure 6—figure supplement 2 ( recordings of YFP+ cortical neurons ) , thy1-YFP-H mice were used ( Feng et al . , 2000 ) . Mice were originally purchased from Jackson Laboratories ( stock # 007906 for Cre-reporter mice , stock # 003782 for thy1-YFP mice ) and bred in the University of Arizona Animal Care Facilities . Mice were infected at 2–3 months of age via intraperitoneal injection with freshly syringe-released parasites for Figures 1 , 2 , 3 and 7 , and related figure supplements . Mice were inoculated with 10 , 000 freshly syringe-released parasites in 200 μl of USP-grade PBS for both II-Cre and III-Cre strains . To increase the reliability of electrophysiology studies ( Figures 5 and 6 , and related Figure 6—figure supplements 1 and 2 ) , mice were infected at 5–6 weeks of age with III-Cre parasites only . For the localization studies , at 3 wpi animals were sedated with a ketamine/xylazine cocktail , intracardially perfused with saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) , after which brains were harvested . Sections were then prepared as previously described ( Mendez et al . , 2018 ) . In brief , left and right brain hemispheres were isolated , drop-fixed in 4% PFA followed by cryopreservation in 30% sucrose . Forty-micron-thick sagittal sections were generated using a freezing sliding microtome ( Microm HM 430 ) . Sections were then stored as free-floating sections in cryoprotective media ( 0 . 05 M sodium phosphate buffer containing 30% glycerol and 30% ethylene glycol ) until labeling procedure was to be done . Sections for localization studies ( Figure 1 , Figure 1—figure supplements 1 and 2 ) were sampled every 200 μm , while for co-localization studies ( Figures 2 and 3 , Figure 3—figure supplements 1 and 2 ) , sections were sampled every 400 μm . To ensure adhesion of tissue onto slides for localization studies , tissue was air-dried onto slides overnight then heated on a slide warmer for 40 min at 34°C . Then tissue was dehydrated using increasing then decreasing concentrations of 50% , 75% , 95% , and 100% ethanol . Slides were washed with TBS , peroxidase inactivated ( 3%H2O2/10% methanol ) , permeabilized ( 0 . 6% Triton X-100 ) , blocked ( 1 . 5% BSA and 1 . 5% goat serum ) , and incubated with rabbit anti-ZsGreen ( Clontech , Cat . No . 632474 , 1:10 , 000 ) for 15–18 hr at room temperature . Next , slides were incubated in goat anti-rabbit polyclonal biotinylated conjugated antibody ( Vector Labs , Cat . No . BA-1000 , 1:500 ) for 2 hr , followed by incubation with avidin-biotin complex kit ( Thermo Fischer Scientific , 32020 ) for 2 hr and visualization with a 3 , 3’-diaminobenzidine kit ( Vectastain , Vector Labs , SK-4100 ) . Sections were then counterstained with cresyl violet for Nissl labeling . For co-localization studies , sections were labeled free-floating , 8–10 sections/mouse . Sections were washed with PBS , permeabilized with 0 . 3% Triton-X , then permeabilized and blocked with 0 . 3% Triton-X and 5% goat serum ( Jackson Immuno ) . For primary antibodies , the following were incubated for 15–18 hr at 4°C in PBS with 0 . 3% Triton-X and 5% goat serum: mouse biotin conjugated anti-NeuN B-clone A60 ( Millipore , MAB377 , 1:500 ) , rabbit anti-calbindin ( Sigma-Aldrich , C2724 , 1:500 ) , rabbit anti-parvalbumin ( Abcam , ab11427 , 1:1000 ) , rabbit anti-FoxP2 ( Abcam , ab16046 , 1:1000 ) , rabbit anti-DARPP32 ( Abcam , ab40801 , 1:500 ) . Following incubation in the appropriate antibody , sections were then incubated for 2 hr in the following secondaries: goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 568 ( Invitrogen , A11011 , 1:500 ) , Cy5 streptavidin ( Invitrogen , SA1011 , 1:500 ) , and all sections were counterstained with 4’ , 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole ( DAPI ) ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , 1:1000 ) . For filled MSNs , sections were processed as discussed below . For staining , sections with filled MSNs were permeabilized with 0 . 6% Triton-X in PBS , then incubated with DARPP32 antibody in 5% goat serum , 0 . 6% Triton-X in PBS for 48 hr at 4°C . Sections were washed then incubated with Cy5 streptavidin ( 1:500 ) and goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 568 ( 1:500 ) for 24 hr at 4°C . Mouse brain slice electrophysiology recording was performed as described ( Suter et al . , 1999; Nisenbaum et al . , 1994; Dorris et al . , 2014; Willett et al . , 2016; Haubensak et al . , 2010 ) . Mice were sacrificed with CO2 , after which the descending aorta was clamped and the mice were intracardially perfused with ice-cold oxygenated artificial cerebral spinal fluid ( ACSF ) containing 126 mM NaCl , 1 . 6 mM KCl , 1 . 2 mM NaH2PO4 , 1 . 2 mM MgCl2 , 2 . 4 mM CaCl2 , 18 mM NaHCO3 , 11 mM glucose . After the olfactory bulbs and the cerebellum were removed , the brain was transferred to a vibratome stage that contained ice-cold ACSF oxygenated with carbogen ( 95% O2 balanced with CO2 ) ; 200 μm coronal sections were then generated with the vibratome ( Leica , VT1000S ) . Brain slices were immediately transferred to oxygenated NMDG-HEPES recovery solution ( 93 mM NMDG , 2 . 5 mM KCl , 1 . 2 mM NaH2PO4 , 30 mM NaHCO3 , 20 mM HEPES , 25 mM glucose , 5 mM sodium ascorbate , 2 mM thiourea , 3 mM sodium pyruvate , 10 mM MgSO4 , 0 . 5 mM CaCl2 , 300–310 mOsm , titrated with 10 N HCl to adjust pH to 7 . 3–7 . 4 ) and were allowed to recover for 15 min at 32–34°C . After the recovery portion , brain slices were then transferred to room temperature oxygenated ACSF for 1 hr . After the rest period , recordings were performed in a rig equipped with a MultiClamp 700B , a Digidata 1550A1 ( Molecular Devices ) , and a fluorescent microscope ( Olympus BX51 ) that was used to visualize sections and identify TINs . Patch pipettes were pulled with P-97 Sutter micropipette puller to achieve a resistance of 8–16 MΩ , after which they were filled with an intracellular solution ( 135 mM potassium gluconate , 5 mM EGTA , 0 . 5 mM CaCl2 , 2 mM MgCl2 , 10 mM HEPES , 2 mM MgATP , and 0 . 1 mM GTP , pH 7 . 3–7 . 4 , 290–300 mOsm ) . Recording data were sampled at 10 kHz , filtered at 3 kHz , and analyzed ( Molecular Devices , pCLAMP , 10 . 7 ) . For bystander neurons and neurons in uninfected mice , the classification as an MSN was based on the firing pattern in response to the current injections as described previously ( Schmidt and Perkel , 1998; Farries and Perkel , 2000; Luo et al . , 2001; Ding and Perkel , 2002; Ding et al . , 2003 , Willett et al . , 2016 ) . For filling experiments , once data from a 200 μm section were recorded , the recorded neurons were filled with 0 . 6% neurobiotin ( Vector Labs , SP1120 ) . Filled sections were then stored in 4% PFA for 24 hr followed by cryopreservation in cryoprotective media until stained as described above . Slides for localization data were imaged on a Leica DMI6000 with a motorized stage , using Leica Application Suite X ( LAS X ) at 10× magnification . Base background subtraction and white balance was maintained throughout individual cohorts . Image stitching was done automatically through LAS X with a 10% overlap and images stored as Leica image file format ( lif ) . Lif images were then processed on a custom MATLAB code for image transformation onto the Allen Institute reference atlas , followed by semi-automated quantification , as described in Mendez et al . , 2018 . Animals were excluded due to having the same or fewer TINs compared to saline-injected animals ( ~15 TINs ) and via ROUT outlier tests . Figure 1—figure supplement 1 has all mice included and includes 100% of the Allen atlas for the enrichment index . For co-localization studies , 8–10 sections/mouse were imaged . Images were captured on a Zeiss LSM880 inverted confocal microscope ( Marley Microscopy Core , UA ) . Images were captured with a 20× objective , with 1× PMT zoom , all settings were the same across specific staining runs . Autofocus was used to capture a z-stack that would capture from edge-to-edge of the section . In Figure 1 , Figure 1—figure supplement 2 , data were analyzed with a one-sample t-test to compare the enrichment score to a value of 1 , which would indicate a random distribution of TINs in a given region of the brain . For Figures 2–3 and associated figure supplements , the data were analyzed with an unpaired two-tailed t-test to test for differences between II-Cre and III-Cre infected groups . For Figure 5 and Figure 7 , the data were analyzed with a Mann-Whitney U-test . Figure 5—figure supplement 2 was analyzed with an unpaired two-tailed t-test . Figure 6 was analyzed with a one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post-test . All statistics were done via Prism statistical software ( GraphPad v9 . 1 . 0 ) ."}
{"doi": "elife-10382-v1", "abstract": "Cholinergic projections from the basal forebrain and brainstem are thought to play important roles in rapid eye movement ( REM ) sleep and arousal . Using transgenic mice in which channelrhdopsin-2 is selectively expressed in cholinergic neurons , we show that optical stimulation of cholinergic inputs to the thalamic reticular nucleus ( TRN ) activates local GABAergic neurons to promote sleep and protect non-rapid eye movement ( NREM ) sleep . It does not affect REM sleep . Instead , direct activation of cholinergic input to the TRN shortens the time to sleep onset and generates spindle oscillations that correlate with NREM sleep . It does so by evoking excitatory postsynaptic currents via α7-containing nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and inducing bursts of action potentials in local GABAergic neurons . These findings stand in sharp contrast to previous reports of cholinergic activity driving arousal . Our results provide new insight into the mechanisms controlling sleep .", "plain language summary": "Sleep is one of the most familiar activities in our lives and yet there are still many unanswered questions related to how it is regulated . The cholinergic system ( or the part of the nervous system that sends signals using a chemical called acetylcholine ) is thought to be important for the phase of sleep that is most similar to being awake , so-called REM sleep . This collection of nerve cells has also been implicated in the process of waking up from sleep . However , it remains unclear how the cholinergic system acts on sleep . Ni , Hou et al . have now used a technique called optogenetics to use light to stimulate the cholinergic system in specific areas in the brains of mice . These experiments found that the activation of the cholinergic system caused awake mice to fall asleep , and promoted more non-REM sleep in sleeping mice . As such , this discovery challenges the previously held view that cholinergic activity was linked to waking up . Acetylcholine affects cells in a similar way to nicotine from cigarettes . In the future , Ni , Hou et al . would like to explore how many nicotine-like substances are released by the cholinergic system in specific brain areas , and to further investigate when and how sleep is promoted .", "article": "1 Introduction Cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain and brainstem provide widespread projections to numerous brain regions , including the cerebral cortex , hippocampus , thalamus , and TRN ( Mesulam et al . , 1983 ) . Abundant behavioral and electrophysiological data suggest that cholinergic neurons play critical roles in regulating paradoxical sleep and the sleep-waking cycle ( Koyama et al . , 1994; Greco et al . , 1999; Bellingham and Funk , 2000; Kobayashi et al . , 2003; Boutrel and Koob , 2004; Darbra et al . , 2004; Brown et al . , 2012 ) , as well as in promoting arousal . Recently , it has been shown that selective activation of cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain induces immediate transition from sleep to waking ( Han et al . , 2014 ) . The TRN serves as a gate for information flow between the cerebral cortex and thalamus due , in part , to its location near thalamic white matter and to the large numbers of GABAergic neurons it contains ( Houser et al . , 1980; Pinault , 2004 ) . The TRN is important for supporting attention ( McAlonan et al . , 2008 ) , sleep regulation ( Steriade et al . , 1987; Espinosa et al . , 2008 ) , and sleep-dependent memory consolidation ( Fogel and Smith , 2011 ) . The physiological effects of cholinergic projections to the TRN , however , remain unclear . In the present study , we took the advantage of the temporal precision and cell-type specificity of optogenetics to show that optical activation of cholinergic input to the TRN stimulates local GABAergic neurons by activating α7-containing nicotinic cholinergic receptors ( α7-nAChRs ) . The resulting increase in GABAergic activity in the TRN shortens sleep onset time and extends NREM sleep duration . These unexpected findings are quite different from those previously reported for cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain and brainstem , which support arousal and REM sleep . The present results indicate that cholinergic projections to the TRN normally promote sleep onset and protect NREM sleep . The behavioral outcome of cholinergic activity across brain regions , therefore , depends on the combination of pathways activated and targets stimulated . 2 Results To research the function of cholinergic innervation in the TRN , we employed ChAT-ChR2 mice in which channelrhodopsin2 ( ChR2 ) was selectively expressed in cholinergic neurons under the control of acetylcholinesterase promotor ( Zhao et al . , 2011 ) . A 473 nm laser was employed to activate the cholinergic fibers through a 200 μm optical fiber ( Figure 1A ) . Histological imaging showed that the optical fiber was well implanted above the TRN ( Figure 1B ) . We then tested EEG from the skull in vivo and found that optical stimulation of cholinergic fibers in the TRN could induce spindle oscillations both in waking and sleep states . To determine which stimulation intensity was most effective for inducing spindle oscillations , we used four intensities of 20 ms , 100 ms , 200 ms , and 400 ms pulses , respectively . The visual inspection revealed increasing EEG power with increasing stimulation intensity . However , when the pulse intensity increased to 200 ms , the EEG power nearly reached the maximum ( Figure 1C ) . We also compared the spindle co-occurrence evoked by 20 ms , 100 ms , 200 ms , and 400 ms , respectively , during awake and NREM states . The co-occurrence of spindle oscillation was greater than that in the waking stage ( P < 0 . 01; Figure 1D ) . Furthermore , spindle co-occurrence increased as the pulse duration increased ( P < 0 . 01; Figure 1D ) . However , there was no significant difference in co-occurrence between the 200 ms and 400 ms stimulation pulse-evoked spindle oscillations ( Figure 1D ) . Next , we compared the evoked and natural spindle oscillations and found there was no significant difference in their frequencies , amplitudes or durations ( Figure 1E ) . These results demonstrate that the evoked spindle oscillation pattern mimicked the natural spindle oscillation pattern . 10 . 7554/eLife . 10382 . 003Figure 1 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 10382 . 003 To investigate which stimulation frequency induced the highest spindle oscillation density , we used a 200-ms pulse with intervals of 1 s , 3 s , 6 s , or 8 s to drive the cholinergic fibers in the TRN , respectively ( Figure 1F ) . We then quantified the spindle density and found that the light pulse with a 6 s interval evoked the highest spindle oscillation densities in both waking and NREM phases . The evoked spindle density was 9 . 2 ± 0 . 5 per min in the NREM stage with a 6 s interval light pulse . These results suggested that a 6 s interval light pulse was most effective at evoking spindles . To examine the roles of cholinergic input to the TRN in modulating sleep , ChAT-ChR2 mice were raised under 12-hr light/12-hr dark conditions . The stimulation protocol applied 473 nm light ( 1 . 5 mW ) for a 200-ms pulse at 6 s intervals for 1 hr , starting 4 hr after 'light off' ( Figure 2A ) . After screening a range of conditions , this protocol appeared optimal and mimicked natural activity ( Figure 1 ) . Combined EEG , EMG , and video recordings were used to determine the sleep-waking patterns and to examine sleep architecture ( Figure 2B ) ( Lupi et al . , 2008 ) . The stimulation protocol induced sleep onset in ChAT-ChR2 mice ( ChAT-ChR2-Sti ) within 16 min , on average ( Figure 2C–E ) . This was 50–60% quicker ( P < 0 . 05 ) than in ChAT-ChR2 mice without stimulation ( ChAT-ChR2-NonSti ) and in WT mice with stimulation ( WT-Sti ) . There was no significant difference between WT-Sti mice and ChAT-ChR2-NonSti mice ( P = 0 . 49 ) . These results suggest that the shortened sleep onset was mediated by ChR2-induced activation of cholinergic fibers in the TRN . Correspondingly , the total sleep time of ChAT-ChR2-Sti mice stimulated for 1 hr increased significantly compared with that of both ChAT-ChR2-NonSti mice ( P < 0 . 01 ) and WT-Sti mice ( P < 0 . 01 ) ( Figure 2F ) . The sleep architecture of ChAT-ChR2-Sti mice was also significantly different from that of either ChAT-ChR2-NonSti or WT-Sti mice . Time spent in NREM sleep in ChAT-ChR2-Sti mice increased by 160% compared with that of ChAT-ChR2-NonSti mice ( P < 0 . 01 ) , while no difference was seen in the duration of REM sleep ( Figure 2G ) . No significant differences in sleep architecture were observed between ChAT-ChR2-NonSti and WT-Sti mice . To test how long it took for recovery of normal function , we recorded sleep states for 1 hr following cessation of stimulation , and found that it took an average of 40 ± 3 min to recover ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) . These results suggest that activation of cholinergic fibers in the TRN can promote sleep onset and alter sleep architecture to protect sleep . 10 . 7554/eLife . 10382 . 004Figure 2 .

Accordingly , we examined the correlation between the density of cholinergic-induced spindle oscillations and the duration of NREM sleep over the recording period . Spindle density in ChAT-ChR2-Sti mice was significantly increased compared with that of ChAT-ChR2-NonSti and WT-Sti mice , while no differences were seen between ChAT-ChR2-NonSti and WT-Sti mice ( p< 0 . 01 , Figure 3A ) . In all three groups , spindle density was greatest ( 9 . 3 ± 0 . 5 min ) during NREM sleep . Correlation analysis indicated a significant positive relationship between spindle oscillation density and NREM sleep duration ( Figure 3B ) . These results suggest that evoked spindle oscillations can play roles similar to those of spontaneous spindle oscillations in protecting and stabilizing sleep . 10 . 7554/eLife . 10382 . 006Figure 3 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 10382 . 006 The TRN is thought to represent a shield surrounding the dorsal thalamus consisting of a homogenous population of parvalbumin ( PV ) -containing GABAergic neurons ( Houser et al . , 1980; Ohara and Lieberman , 1985 ) . Confocal imaging of brain slices from B13 mice ( which express GFP under a PV promoter ) after immunostaining for PV confirmed that PV-positive neurons were abundant throughout the TRN ( Figure 4A ) . To identify PV-positive neurons for mechanistic studies , we crossed ChAT-ChR2 mice with B13 mice . This generated mice expressing both ChR2 in the cholinergic neurons and GFP in the PV neurons , permitting whole-cell recordings from GABAergic neurons while optically stimulating local cholinergic input . Immunostaining revealed numerous cholinergic fibers surrounding PV-positive neurons in the TRN of ChAT-ChR2 mice ( Figure 4B ) . First , we stimulated cholinergic neurons and found that a 5-ms pulse could induce the firing of action potentials in the cholinergic neurons when stimulating cell bodies ( Figure 4C ) . We then tried 5-ms , 50-ms , 100-ms , and 200-ms light pulses to stimulate cholinergic fibers and recorded neuronal activity of GABAergic neurons in the TRN . ( Figure 4D ) . We found that light pulses of short duration , such as 5 ms and 50 ms , failed to induce bursts of action potentials in GABAergic neurons . A light pulse of at least 100 ms was required to induce bursts of action potentials and spindles . Whole-cell recording in voltage-clamp mode from PV neurons in the TRN-containing brain slice showed that pure light stimulation ( without injection current ) of a 200-ms pulse evoked fast excitatory post-synaptic currents ( EPSCs; Figure 4E , lower ) . They were accompanied by rhythmic high-frequency bursts of action potentials ( APs ) seen in current-clamp mode ( Figure 4E , upper ) . In vivo extracellular recording in the TRN of anesthetized ChAT-ChR2 mice revealed that the optical stimulation of cholinergic fibers induced spikes in the GABAergic neurons ( Figure 4F ) . These results suggest that cholinergic projections to the TRN produce excitatory input sufficient to evoke bursts of APs in PV-containing TRN neurons . To determine which cholinergic projections mediated these results , we injected AAV9-CAG-DIO-EGFP-2A-TVA and AAV9-CAG-DIO-RV-G into the TRN . Three weeks later , EnvA-pseudotyped RV-ΔG-DsRed , which can infect efficiently and travel retrogradely , was injected into the same site . We found that the DsRed signal was detected in some cholinergic neurons of the nucleus basalis magnocellularis ( nBM ) in the basal forebrain ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1A ) and pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus ( PPTg ) of the brain stem ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1B ) . Statistical results showed that about 30% of cholinergic neurons ( VAChT antibody labeled ) were positive for mCherry ( retrograde virus labeled ) in the nBM , and ~7% were positive for mCherry in the PPTg ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1C ) . These results demonstrate that TRN neurons receive cholinergic projections from both the basal forebrain and brain stem . 10 . 7554/eLife . 10382 . 007Figure 4 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 10382 . 008 To identify synaptic components mediating cholinergic-induced EPSCs in the TRN , we employed specific blockers . Recordings in the presence of tetrodotoxin ( TTX , 1 μM ) to block APs completely prevented optical stimulation of cholinergic fibers in the TRN of ChAT-ChR2 mice from eliciting EPSCs in PV-containing neurons ( Figure 5A ) . This is consistent with the EPSCs being AP-dependent , as expected for presynaptic stimulation of transmitter release . In contrast , light-evoked EPSCs were not blocked by including the combination of CNQX ( 20 μM ) as an inhibitor of glutamatergic AMPA receptors , AP5 ( 50 μM ) as an inhibitor of glutamatergic NMDA receptors , and picrotoxin ( PTX , 100 μM ) as an inhibitor of GABAA receptors ( Figure 5B ) . This indicates that neither rapid glutamatergic nor GABAergic transmission is required for cholinergic induction of the EPSCs . Dihydro-β-erythroidine ( DHβE ) , a selective antagonist of α4β2-containing nAChRs , decreased the amplitude of light-evoked EPSCs by 12% , 34% , and 99% at 5 nM , 10 nM , and 100 nM , respectively ( Figure 5C ) . However , methyllycaconitine ( MLA , 5 nM ) , a specific antagonist of α7-nAChRs , completely blocked the light-evoked EPSCs ( Figure 5D ) and the accompanying bursts of APs ( Figure 5E ) . The concentration was consistent with previous research ( Bonfante-Cabarcas et al . , 1996 ) . Immunostaining yielded extensive labeling for α7-nAChRs on PV-containing neurons in the TRN ( Figure 5F ) . These results indicate that the light-evoked , AP-dependent release of ACh from cholinergic projections in the TRN elicits EPSCs and bursts of APs in GABAergic neurons of the TRN by activating α7-nAChRs . 10 . 7554/eLife . 10382 . 009Figure 5 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 10382 . 009 We found that a light pulse of at least 100 ms duration could induce bursts of action potentials in GABAergic neurons in the TRN ( Figure 4 ) . It might be that the activation of GABAergic neurons by cholinergic fiber stimulation was an indirect effect via α7 cholinergic receptors ( Figure 5 ) . It requires a certain amount of Ach release to excite postsynaptic GABAergic neurons to fire action potentials and spindles . Light pulses of 10 ms or 50 ms are too short to induce the release of sufficient Ach , which evokes the burst of action potentials in postsynaptic GABAergic neurons and spindles . Having found that α7-nAChRs mediate cholinergic input to PV-containing GABAergic neurons in the TRN , we tested whether this same pathway was responsible for cholinergic modulation of sleep onset and sleep protection . Half an hour before stimulation , we injected MLA ( 1 μl , 100 nM ) or saline ( 1 μl , 0 . 9% NaCl ) locally into the TRN of ChAT-ChR2 mice through a cannula implanted in the brain . The mice were then given optical stimulation ( 200-ms pulses at 6 s intervals , 1 . 5 mW blue laser ) for 1 hr in the TRN . Quantification of the responses indicated that MLA completely blocked light-evoked changes in latency to sleep onset , total sleep time , and sleep architecture ( Figure 6 ) . None of the parameters were significantly different from those of WT-Sti mice . In contrast , the saline-injected mice could still be induced to sleep and showed increased NREM by the activation of cholinergic fibers during the 1 hr stimulation , compared with the ChAT-ChR2-Sti-MLA and WT-Sti groups . To further test MLA on spontaneous sleep , we injected saline and MLA into the TRN of ChAT-ChR2 mice in the daytime , and found that in vivo injection of MLA ( the antagonist of α7-nAChRs ) significantly decreased spontaneous sleep time from 37 . 2 ± 4 . 1 min to 27 . 3 ± 3 . 2 min ( p < 0 . 01 , Figure 6—figure supplement 1 ) . These results indicate that cholinergic promotion of sleep onset and sleep protection are mediated by activating PV-expressing neurons of the TRN through α7-nAChRs . 10 . 7554/eLife . 10382 . 010Figure 6 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 10382 . 011 Having found that cholinergic input to PV-containing TRN neurons generates spindle oscillations and promotes NREM sleep via α7-nAChRs , we wanted to confirm whether direct stimulation of TRN GABAergic neurons could achieve the same effects . For this purpose , we used VGAT-ChR2 mice in which ChR2 was specifically expressed in the GABAergic neurons ( Zhao et al . , 2011 ) so that those neurons would be selectively activated by light pulses delivered to the TRN . Testing the paradigm first in vitro showed that a light pulse of 10 ms applied to an acute slice could induce bursts of APs in GABAergic neurons of the TRN ( Figure 7A ) . Testing three different optical stimulation patterns in vivo ( 20 Hz , 8 Hz , or single 10 ms pulses ) indicated that 8 Hz stimulation was most successful at evoking spindle oscillations both in waking and NREM states ( P < 0 . 05 , Figure 7B , C ) . Accordingly , we used that stimulation protocol ( 10 ms of 8 Hz for 1 s at 6-s intervals ) to induce sleep in VGAT-ChR2 mice , which were raised under a 12-hr light/12-hr dark cycle ( Figure 7D ) . Blue laser light of 473 nm was delivered into the TRN through a 200 μm optical fiber for 1 hr starting 4 hr after 'light off' . Both EEG and EMG were recorded , and sleep onset and sleep architecture were then measured . Optical stimulation significantly reduced the sleep onset time of VGAT-ChR2 mice ( VGAT-ChR2-Sti , 27 . 2 ± 3 . 2 min ) compared with that of the controls ( VGAT-ChR2-NonSti; 5 . 5 ± 0 . 8 min , P < 0 . 01 , Figure 7E ) . Similarly , the duration of sleep during the 1 hr optical stimulation period also increased by 156% compared with that of the controls ( P < 0 . 01 , Figure 7F ) . Furthermore , the architecture of sleep differed greatly in VGAT-ChR2-Sti mice vs . VGAT-ChR2-NonSti mice . Time spent in the NREM phase was significantly greater for VGAT-ChR2-Sti mice ( 27 . 2 ± 2 . 1 min ) than for VGAT-ChR2-NonSti mice ( 15 . 2 ± 1 . 3 min , p < 0 . 01 ) , while no significant differences were seen in the duration of the REM stage ( Figure 7G ) . These results support that elevating the activity of GABAergic neurons in the TRN can promote sleep in ways that mimic the effects of cholinergic excitation of the TRN . 10 . 7554/eLife . 10382 . 012Figure 7 .

In ( C , E , F , G ) , data represent mean ± SEM ( n = 7 mice , *p < 0 . 05 , **p < 0 . 01 , two-tailed t-test between VGAT-ChR2 mice with spindle-like stimulation and VGAT-ChR2 mice without stimulation ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 10382 . 012 3 Discussion Our results show that cholinergic projections to the TRN can activate local GABAergic neurons via α7-nAChRs without requiring either glutamatergic or GABAergic rapid transmission . Furthermore , cholinergic fiber activation of GABAergic neurons in the TRN in vivo can promote sleep onset and increase the probability of spindle oscillation and duration of the NREM phase . Lastly , direct stimulation of GABAergic neurons in the TRN to elicit activity comparable to that induced by cholinergic input produces the same kinds of changes in sleep behavior seen following cholinergic activation of the neurons . These results demonstrate the capacity of cholinergic input , acting through GABAergic neurons in the TRN , to promote critical features of sleep . Previous studies employing pharmacology , brain injury , and electrical stimulation revealed important contributions of cholinergic signaling to the regulation of the sleep-to-waking cycle and paradoxical sleep ( Campbell et al . , 1969; Sarter et al . , 2009; Brown et al . , 2012; Hamlin et al . , 2013; Sims et al . , 2013 ) . These earlier studies suggested that cholinergic input to the TRN neurons was primarily inhibitory , acting on M2 muscarinic ACh receptors ( McCormick and Prince , 1986 ) . Local delivery of ACh to the TRN was seen to induce only a slow inhibitory response , leading to the conclusion that the ACh-induced bursts of APs observed were somehow the result of the GABAergic neurons in the TRN becoming hyperpolarized ( McCormick and Prince , 1986 ) . Instead , we showed cholinergic input to the TRN stimulates the GABAergic neurons via α7-nAChRs , and that this input through α7-nAChRs induces bursts of action potentials and promotes/stabilizes sleep . Previous failures to detect an α7-nAChR response in the TRN were almost certainly caused by electrical stimulation methods , i . e . ACh perfusion . Because α7-nAChRs desensitize so quickly ( Giniatullin et al . , 2005 ) , their responses can be missed in experimental paradigms . Another group found that Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials ( EPSPs ) induced by electrical stimulation were blocked by dihydro-β-erythroidine ( DhβE , 300 nM ) , indicating that the EPSPs were mediated by α4β2-containing nAChRs ( Sun et al . , 2013 ) . However , DhβE ( 300 nM ) can block both α4β2- and α7 nAChR-mediated currents ( Alkondon and Albuquerque , 1993 ) , and non-specific electrical stimulation may enable extrasynaptic transmitter release . Cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain send projections to many targets , including the cerebral cortex , hippocampus , thalamus , and TRN . Selective activation of cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain has been shown to induce an immediate transition from sleep to waking ( Han et al . , 2014 ) . The present study specifically activated cholinergic fibers locally in the TRN , which , surprisingly , showed the opposite effect . It induced transition from waking to sleep , indicating that direct cholinergic projections to the TRN promote sleep onset and sleep stabilization . GABAergic neurons of the TRN fire AP bursts mediating slow and spindle waves ( Cain and Snutch , 2010 ) . These bursts are very important for the generation of thalamocortical spindle waves ( von Krosigk et al . , 1993; Lee et al . , 2013 ) , and spindle rhythms play important roles in protecting sleep initiation and elevating arousal threshold ( Steriade , 2005; Wimmer et al . , 2012 ) . We propose that excitation of cholinergic fibers in the TRN acts on GABAergic neurons through α7-nAChRs ( Roth et al . , 2000 ) to depolarize the membrane sufficiently to induce bursts of APs . Our results demonstrate a significant positive relationship between spindle density and the promotion of the NREM state and sleep stabilization . Activation of the cholinergic neurons appears to play critical roles in the switch from waking to sleep and in the protection of sleep itself , especially by increasing the NREM state . It is possible that stimulating axonal fibers may cause antidromic and collateral activation because TRN-projecting cholinergic neurons mainly involved in the nBM and PPTg also project to other brain areas . Cholinergic neurons in the nBM of the basal forebrain project to the cerebral cortex , hippocampus , and TRN , and that in the PPTg of the brainstem project to the thalamus , new striatum , and basal forebrain . Activation of cholinergic fibers in the TRN may antidromically collaterally excite cell bodies , or collaterally act on other neurons , leading to the indirect effects on sleep . To address this question , we locally injected the α7 receptor blocker MLA in the TRN and found that sleep induced by cholinergic fiber stimulation was completely inhibited , suggesting that the possibility was small . We found that unilateral stimulations and drug infusions had significant effects on behavior and phenotype . This did not exclude spontaneous behavior evoked by contralateral Ach release . Bilateral stimulation is better to clearly address the mechanisms . The finding that optical stimulation of cholinergic projections to the TRN directly elicits EPSCs in the GABAergic neurons via α7-nAChRs is unexpected . Though α7-nAChRs are widely distributed in the brain , they are usually thought to provide a modulatory role . From presynaptic locations , the receptors can enhance transmitter release ( McGehee et al . , 1995; Gray et al . , 1996 ) , while from post- or presynaptic locations they can modulate synaptic responses indirectly through calcium-dependent mechanisms ( Dajas-Bailador and Wonnacott , 2004 ) . Rarely , if ever , have α7-nAChRs been shown to be the primary mediator of rapid , synaptic transmission in the central nervous system ( CNS ) . In the present study , the ability of MLA to block cholinergically-induced EPSCs in the TRN clearly implicates α7-nAChRs . Immunostaining corroborated the presence of α7-nAChRs in the GABAergic neurons of the TRN . The inability of CNQX , AP5 , and PTX to block the EPSCs demonstrated that rapid glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission were not responsible for the EPSCs . The fact that α7-nAChRs have a high relative permeability to calcium ( Bertrand et al . , 1993 ) and trigger calcium release from internal stores ( Dajas-Bailador and Wonnacott , 2004 ) may be relevant for the kinds of signaling effective at promoting spindle oscillations . Our study provides critical insight into cholinergic roles in mediating biological rhythms . Cholinergic neurons play an important role in waking-to-sleep cycles and in sleep stabilization by activating GABAergic neurons in the TRN through α7-nAChRs . Although a great deal of work has been done to examine the roles of cholinergic systems in biological rhythms , previous experiments have mainly focused on the sleep-to-waking transition , and results have been limited by the experimental techniques used . Cholinergic projections from different brain areas to the TRN may have opposing effects , acting through different receptors and synaptic pathways ( Everitt and Robbins , 1997; Abbott et al . , 2003 ) . The states of sleep and waking may be determined by the opposing inputs serving as a system of checks and balances . Because a number of psychiatric disorders , such as schizophrenia ( Ferrarelli and Tononi , 2011 ) , show sleep disturbances and loss of spindle oscillation , the results reported here may also be useful in suggesting new targets for therapeutic intervention in these cases . 4 Materials and methods Mice were housed in individual Plexiglass recording cages in temperature ( 24 ± 1°C ) and humidity ( 40–60% ) controlled recording chambers under a 12/12 hr light/dark cycle ( starting at 08:00 ) . Food and water were available ad libitum . PV-Cre mice were provided by Z . J . Huang ( Cold Spring Harbor , USA ) and X . H . Zhang ( Beijing Normal University , China ) , and ChAT-ChR2 and VGAT-ChR2 mice were provided by G . P . Feng ( Massachusetts Institute of Technology , USA ) and M . M . Luo ( National Institute of Biological Sciences , China ) . All experiments were carried out in accordance with the guidelines described in the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals , and were approved by Committee of Laboratory Animal Center of Zhejiang University ( ZJU201553001 ) . Mice were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane ( 1 . 5–3% ) , the brain was removed after decapitation , and slices ( 300 μm thick ) were then cut in a solution containing ( in mM ) : 250 sucrose , 26 NaHCO3 10 D ( + ) glucose , 4 MgCl2 , 2 . 5 KCl , 2 sodium pyruvate , 1 . 25 H2NaPO4 , 0 . 5 ascorbic acid , 0 . 1 CaCl2 , and 1 kynurenic acid , pH 7 . 4 . Recordings were made at 34°C ( TC-324B; Warner ) in artificial cerebrospinal fluid solution containing ( in mM ) : 126 NaCl , 26 NaHCO3 , 1 . 25 NaH2PO4 , 3 KCl , 2 CaCl2 , 2 MgCl2 , and 10 D-glucose . All external solutions were saturated with 95% O2/2 . 5% CO2 gas . Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were made with pipettes ( 3–4 MΩ ) filled with internal solution containing ( in mM ) : 130 K-gluconate , 2 NaCl , 4 MgCl2 , 20 Hepes , 4 Na2ATP , 0 . 4 Na3GTP , 1 EGTA , and 10 Na2phosphocreatine , pH 7 . 25 , with 1 M KOH; 290–300 mOsm . CNQX , AP5 , and PTX were purchased from Sigma . Recordings were obtained using the Axopatch 700B amplifier and Digidata 1440A ( Molecular Devices ) , and neurons were visualized using infrared differential interference contrast visualization through a Nikon E600FN microscope and a CCD camera ( Hamamatsu , Japan ) . Data were filtered at 10 kHz and digitized at 20 kHz , and acquired and analyzed using pCLAMP10 . 2 software ( Molecular Devices ) . The laser was controlled by analog commands from the Digidata1440A ( Molecular Devices ) . Eight-week old mice were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS . The brains were harvested and placed in 30% sucrose solution for 24 hr , then embedded in OCT ( optimal cutting temperature; Tissue-Tek; Sakura Finetek , USA ) and subsequently cut into 30-μm thick slices . The slices were stained using monoclonal anti-parvalbumin ( 1:4500; clone parv-19; Sigma ) and antibody rabbit anti-VAChT ( Synaptic System; 1:500 ) as the primary antibodies . After several washes with PBS , sections were incubated with Alexa Fluor-488 goat anti-mouse IgG ( Invitrogen ) . Fluorescence was detected using an Olympus confocal microscope and standard FITC filters . For rabies virus-mediated retrograde monosynaptic neuronal tracing , several AAV backbone plasmids were constructed in our lab or ordered from Addgene . The pAAV-EF1a-FLEX-GT was acquired from E . d . Callaway’s lab; pAAV-CAG-DIO-GT was constructed by sub-cloning the CAG promoter and the coding region of EGFP:2A:TVA from pAAV-EF1a-FLEX-GT ( Addgene plasmid 26198 ) . The pAAV-EF1a-DIO-RV-G was constructed by sub-cloning the CAG promoter and the coding region of RV-G from pAAV-EF1a-FLEX-GTB ( Addgene plasmid 26197 ) into the pAAV-EF1a-double floxed-hChR2 ( H134R ) -EYFP plasmid ( Addgene plasmid 20298 ) . All rAAV viruses were packaged into serotype 9 with titer at approximately 1 × 1013 genome copies per milliliter ( Neuronbiotech ) . Two- to three-month-old PV-Cre mice were used for retrograde transsynaptic tracing . A volume of 0 . 2 μl of a 1:1 mixture of AAV9-CAG-DIO-EGFP-2A-TVA ( 1 . 3 × 1013 particles/ml ) and AAV9-CAG-DIO-RV-G ( 1 . 5 × 1013 particles/ml ) was stereotaxically injected into the TRN ( coordinates in mm: AP -0 . 65 , ML 1 . 30 , DV -3 . 20 ) using a stereotaxic injector ( Ruiwode Life Science , Shenzhen , China ) . Three weeks later , 0 . 5 μl of rabies-DsRed virus ( 3 × 108 particles/ml ) was injected into the same site . For all experimental tests , 6- to 88-week-old male mice were anesthetized with 1 . 5–33% isoflurane and placed in a stereotaxic frame . For each animal , five stainless-steel screws were implanted in the skull to provide EEG contacts , ground , and mechanical support for the drive . Epidural electrodes were implanted in the frontal ( anteroposterior , +2 . 0 mm; ML , -1 . 5 mm ) and parietal lobes ( anteroposterior , -2 . 0 mm; ML , -3 . 0 mm ) , and a grounding electrode was implanted in the occipital region . For EMG signal recording , two polyester enameled wire electrodes were inserted into the neck musculature to record postural tone . The implant was attached to a custom-designed stereotaxic arm and lowered to the following stereotaxic coordinates ( M/L 1 . 7 mm , A/P 0 . 8 mm , D/V -3 . 2 mm ) . Insulated leads from the EEG and EMG electrodes were then soldered to a mini connector . For each animal , the cannula was secured using dental cement . After one week of recovery , each mouse was connected to the A-M system 1800 amplifier . The amplified cortical EEG and EMG signals were acquired ( sampling frequency , 2 kHz ) by Digidata 1440A ( Molecular Devices ) . The data were acquired as continuous 1-hr segments with different stimulation protocols . For ChAT-ChR2 mice , the stimulation was persistent 200-ms laser pulses with an interval of 6 s . For VGAT-ChR2 mice , the stimulation was 8 Hz , 10 ms pulses with an interval of 6 s . Simultaneous video monitoring was performed for the visual inspection of sleep behavior . All scoring was measured by combined EEG , EMG , and video recordings . A 473 nm laser from a solid-state laser diode ( Newdoon ) was delivered to the TRN though an optical fiber ( 200 μm , NA = 0 . 22 ) . Prior to connecting to the cannula , laser power was measured to 3 mW using an optical power meter ( Thorlabs , S121c ) . Based on measurement prior to surgery , we found 50% losses of laser power at the tip of the implanted fiber . The ultimate laser power was about 1 . 5 mW at the fiber tip . The 1440A was used to shape laser pulses of 5 or 10 ms duration at different frequencies . Sleep spindles were analyzed using Clampfit 10 . 2 ( Axon Instruments ) and NeuroExplorer4 ( Plexon ) in the wake and NREM sleep stages and detected using the following complementary method: the EEG time series were bandpass-filtered in the frequency range of 7–15 Hz , and signal was computed in moving windows of 1 s duration and at 0 . 01 s intervals . Sleep spindles were detected during those times in which the root mean square ( rms ) value of the filtered signal exceeded its 85th percentile , as previously suggested ( Dang-Vu et al . , 2010 ) . Detected spindles with durations lower than 0 . 5 s or longer than 5 s were discarded . To estimate spindle density ( SD ) during a given sleep stage , all spindles were counted and the total number was divided by the total recording time . Power spectrum analyses of sleep stages and spindles were performed in moving windows of 1 s duration and at 0 . 01 s intervals , and power spectrum distribution was estimated with a resolution of 0 . 5 Hz . The post power spectrum was smoothed by a 'Boxcar' filter with a width of 6 . The data were collected and processed randomly . All immunocytochemistry and behavioral tests were carried out blind . The electrophysiology experiments were not blind , but data collection and analyses were performed blind . Sample size was calculated according to the preliminary experiment results and the following formula: N=[ ( Zα/2+Zβ ) σδ]2 ( Q1−1+Q2−1 ) , where α = 0 . 05 significant level , β = 0 . 2 , power = 1-β , δ is the difference between the means of two samples , and Q is the sample fraction . The samples were randomly assigned to each group . The data were presented as mean ± SEM . One-way ANOVA was used for analysis of electrophysiological data in vitro . Two-tailed Student’s t-tests were performed after the normality test for the data from all groups in vivo . Variance was similar between groups being compared . We considered p < 0 . 05 to be statistically significant . The sleep patterns were determined by combined EEG , EMG , and video recordings . Data were presented as mean ± SEM . All data were analyzed using Origin8 . 0 ( OriginLab ) , Clampfit 10 . 2 ( Axon Instruments ) , NeuroExplorer4 ( Plexon ) , and Microsoft Excel 2010 . Data were exported into Illustrator CS6 ( Adobe Systems ) for preparation of figures ."}

Here , we show how aquatic animals ( i . e . carp , crabs , and softshell turtles ) benefit paddy ecosystems when cocultured with rice .

Each experiment included a rice monoculture ( RM ) treatment and a rice-aquatic animal ( RA ) coculture treatment; RA included feed addition for aquatic animals . In the field experiments , rice yield was higher with RA than with RM , and RA also produced aquatic animal yields that averaged 0 . 52–2 . 57 t ha-1 .

Stable-isotope-labeling ( 13C ) in the field experiments indicated that the organic matter decomposition rate was greater with RA than with RM .

In natural ecosystems , experiments have shown that increases in species number can increase ecosystem productivity and stability ( Hector et al . , 1999; Tilman et al . , 2006; Loreau and de Mazancourt , 2013; Tilman et al . , 2014; van der Plas , 2019 ) . These positive effects of species diversity on ecosystem functioning are mainly explained by niche partitioning , facilitation , and complementary resource use ( Cardinale et al . , 2002; Isbell et al . , 2009; Cardinale , 2011; Brooker et al . , 2021 ) . Interspecific facilitation ( which occurs when one species makes conditions more favorable for another species ) or complementary resource use are common in terrestrial , marine , and wetland ecosystems ( Bruno et al . , 2003; Brooker et al . , 2007; He et al . , 2013; Bulleri et al . , 2015; Wright et al . , 2017 ) . Plants can make the local environment more favorable for their co-existing partners by reducing thermal , drought , and salt stress ( Gómez-Aparicio et al . , 2004; Gómez‐Aparicio et al . , 2008; Pretzsch et al . , 2013; Anthelme et al . , 2014 ) ; by increasing nutrient availability Li et al . , 2007; by removing competitors or deterring predators ( Callaway et al . , 2005; Gómez‐Aparicio et al . , 2008; Flory et al . , 2014 ) ; and by stimulating beneficial soil microorganisms ( Hortal et al . , 2013; Rodríguez‐Echeverría et al . , 2015 ) . Animals can also enhance plant growth and population development by improving the soil environment ( Daleo et al . , 2007; Booth et al . , 2019; by removing competitors Cushman et al . , 2011 ) ; or by facilitating dispersal of fruits and seeds ( Bronstein et al . , 2006; Carlo et al . , 2014 ) . Facilitative interactions have recently been successfully applied to forest restoration in arid areas ( Gómez-Aparicio et al . , 2004 ) ; to the establishment of plant communities in salty marshes or on beaches ( Bruno , 2000 ) ; and to coral reef restoration ( Abelson , 2006 ) . Researchers have also proposed that facilitation or resource complementarity between species may increase the sustainability of agricultural production ( Ren et al . , 2014; Brooker et al . , 2021 ) . Although an increase in species richness in a natural plant community is expected to result in an increase in plant mass , an increase in species richness in agriculture may not always lead to increases in yield due to competition for light or nutrients ( Omer et al . , 2007 ) . Understanding how species may or may not benefit is therefore critical for using species diversity in agriculture . Intercropping systems ( e . g . the interplanting of corn or wheat with a legume ) or the planting of cover crops are examples of the successful use of crop diversity in agriculture . In legume-based cropping systems , legume crops provide intercropped non-legume crops with symbiotically fixed nitrogen ( N ) ( Li et al . , 2007; Tsialtas et al . , 2018 ) and with increased phosphorus ( P ) availability due to the lowering of soil pH by N2-fixing bacteria ( Li et al . , 2007 ) ; these effects increase the yield of the intercropped species ( Li et al . , 2007 ) . Other intercropping systems can increase the diversity of soil microorganisms , natural enemies , and pollinators ( Cardinale et al . , 2003; Kremen et al . , 2007; Letourneau et al . , 2011; Norris et al . , 2018 ) . Using diverse cover crops can also help reduce soil erosion and greenhouse gas emissions ( Kaye and Quemada , 2017 ) . Because paddy fields provide a shallow water habitat suitable for some aquatic animals ( e . g . carp , crabs , and softshell turtles ) , the coculturing of rice with aquatic animals has been practiced in many countries ( e . g . Bangladesh , China , Egypt , India , Indonesia , Myanmar , Malaysia , the Philippines , Thailand , and Vietnam ) ( Halwart and Gupta , 2004; Frei and Becker , 2005b; Ahmed and Garnett , 2011 ) . Several rice-aquatic animal coculture systems ( e . g . rice-carp , rice-crab , and rice-turtle ) have been developed ( Hu et al . , 2016 ) . Field surveys and experiments have shown that these coculture systems can increase rice yields and soil fertility while reducing the need for fertilizers and pesticides compared to rice monoculture ( Xie et al . , 2011; Hu et al . , 2016; Zhang et al . , 2016; Guo et al . , 2020 ) . Why coculturing these aquatic animals with rice can reduce the application of fertilizers and pesticides , however , is poorly understood . Understanding how aquatic animals contribute to the reductions in fertilizer and pesticide application in coculture systems would help the development of sustainable rice production . Animal behaviors ( e . g . moving and grazing ) are important drivers of ecosystem processes ( e . g . carbon and nutrient cycling , and energy flux ) ( Vanni et al . , 2006; Schmitz et al . , 2018; McInturf et al . , 2019 ) . In wetland or aquatic ecosystems , grazing , ‘muddying’ , and burrowing by aquatic animals have important roles in nutrient cycling ( Vanni , 2002; Thrush et al . , 2006; Devlin et al . , 2015; Atkinson et al . , 2021 ) . For paddy ecosystems in which rice and aquatic animals coexist , understanding whether and how the behavior of aquatic animals affects ecosystem processes and functions could help researchers predict the effects of a coculture system of rice and an aquatic animal , and could also help improve the coculture system . In this study , we conducted three field experiments and three mesocosm experiments to determine how coculture with aquatic animals benefits a rice paddy ecosystem in terms of productivity , nutrient-use efficiency , and the stability of soil N content . Because some fresh water animals ( e . g . carp , crabs , crayfish , and softshell turtles ) that are cultured in fish ponds or in paddy fields are omnivores and may use weeds , algae , and phytoplankton as food , we expected that the coculture of these aquatic animals would increase rice yield by reducing competitors of rice . We also expected that the cocultured aquatic animals would promote organic matter decomposition because of their feeding activity and would thereby promote nutrient recycling in the paddy ecosystem . Feed is often applied in the form of pellets to increase the growth of aquatic animals in coculture systems ( Hu et al . , 2016; Guo et al . , 2020 ) , and significant percentages of the N in the feed is often unconsumed and unassimilated by the animals . We therefore expected that this unconsumed and unassimilated feed-N could be used by rice plants , resulting in higher N-use efficiency and a more stable soil N content in a coculture system than in a rice monoculture . 2 Results We conducted three 4-year-long field experiments: one with rice-carp , one with rice-crabs , and one with rice-turtles . We found that rice yield was significantly higher in the RA treatment ( the treatment with the coculture of rice and an aquatic animal ) than in the RM treatment ( the treatment with rice monoculture ) in the rice-carp experiment ( F1 , 10=7 . 828 , p = 0 . 019 ) , the rice-crab experiment ( F1 , 10=5 . 957 , p = 0 . 035 ) , and the rice-turtle experiment ( F1 , 10=12 . 472 , p = 0 . 005 ) ( Figure 1a ) . Compared to the corresponding monoculture , average rice yield over the 4 years in the RA treatment was 9 . 13% ± 3 . 11% higher for rice-carp , 12 . 05% ± 1 . 16 higher for rice-crabs , and 8 . 69% ± 1 . 74 higher for rice-turtles . During the experimental period , the average annual aquatic animal yield ( in t ha–1 ) was 0 . 85 for rice-carp , 0 . 56 for rice-crab , and 2 . 66 for rice-turtle systems ( Figure 1a ) . Averaged across all 4 years , total soil N content was not significantly different in the RA vs . the RM treatment in all three experiments ( F1 , 10=0 . 294 and p = 0 . 687 for the rice-carp experiment; F1 , 10=1 . 325 and p = 0 . 154 for the rice-crab experiment; and F1 , 10=0 . 236 and p = 0 . 345 for the rice-turtle experiment ) ( Figure 1b ) . At the end of the experiments , total soil N contents had not changed relative to initial values in the RA treatment of the rice-carp ( t5 = −0 . 533 , p = 0 . 631 ) , rice-crab ( t5 = 0 . 213 , p = 0 . 842 ) , and rice-turtle systems ( t5 = −1 . 279 , p = 0 . 259 ) ( Appendix 1—figure 1 ) . Compared to the RM treatment , the RA treatment received extra N from fish feed ( Appendix 2—table 1 ) . Data from the 4 years of the experiments showed that apparent N-use efficiency ( ANUE ) was higher in the RA treatment than in the RM treatment for the rice-crab system ( F1 , 10=9 . 557 , p = 0 . 011 ) and the rice-turtle system ( F1 , 10=7 . 302 , p = 0 . 022 ) but not for the rice-carp system ( F1 , 10=0 . 209 , p = 0 . 657 ) ( Figure 1c ) . Weed biomass was significantly lower in the RA treatment than in the RM treatment in the rice-carp experiment ( F1 , 10=513 . 456 , p = 0 . 000 ) , the rice-crab experiment ( F1 , 10=538 . 032 , p = 0 . 000 ) , and the rice-turtle experiment ( F1 , 10=557 . 659 , p = 0 . 000 ) ( Figure 2 ) . In all three experiments , weed biomass significantly decreased over time in the RA treatment ( p < 0 . 05 ) but not in the RM treatment ( p > 0 . 05 ) . Food source analysis showed that 50 . 2% , 34 . 9% , and 16 . 0% of the carp , crab , and turtle foods , respectively , were from the field environment rather than from applied feed ( Figure 3 ) . The main non-feed food sources for the aquatic animals in the rice fields included weeds , macro-algae , phytoplankton , zooplankton , and zoobenthos ( Figure 3 ) . Determination of the stable isotope ( 13C ) content in maize leaves indicated that the percentage remaining in maize litter tubes at 40 days after the beginning ( DAB ) of the experiment was lower in the RA treatment than in the RM treatment in the rice-turtle experiment ( F1 , 10 = 23 . 353 , p = 0 . 001 ) ( Figure 4 ) but did not significantly differ between RM and RA treatments in the rice-carp experiment ( F1 , 10 = 0 . 076 , p = 0 . 788 ) or the rice-crab experiment ( F1 , 10 = 1 . 092 , p = 0 . 321 ) ( Figure 4 ) . At 80 DAB , however , the decomposition rate was higher in the RA treatment than in the RM treatment in all three experiments ( for rice-carp: F1 , 10 = 11 . 432 , p = 0 . 007; for rice-crab: F1 , 10=15 . 572 , p = 0 . 003; for rice-turtle: F1 , 10 = 14 . 349 , p = 0 . 004 ) ( Figure 4 ) . The δ15N percentage in the rice plant biomass was significantly higher in the RA treatment than in the RM treatment in all three mesocosm experiments ( for rice-carp: F1 , 10 = 1278 , p = 0 . 000; for rice-crab: F1 , 10 = 210 . 320 , p = 0 . 000; for rice-turtle: F1 , 10 = 91 . 572 , p = 0 . 000 ) ( Appendix 1—figure 2 ) . The results from the mesocosm experiments also indicated that rice used from 13 . 02% to 35 . 13% of the feed-15N ( Figure 5a ) . The N in feed that was not consumed by aquatic animals represented 9 . 61–30 . 65% of the rice biomass-N in the RA treatments ( Figure 5b ) . The δ15N content in the soil in the mesocosm experiments did not significantly differ at the beginning vs . the end for the RM treatments ( for rice-carp: t10 = 0 . 131 , p = 0 . 449 , n = 6; for rice-crab: t10 = 0 . 115 , p = 0 . 455 , n = 6; for rice-turtle: t10 = 0 . 523 , p = 0 . 623 , n = 6 ) , but was significantly higher at the end than at the beginning for the RA treatments ( for rice-carp: t10 = 2 . 178 , p = 0 . 027 , n = 6; for rice-crab: t10 = 2 . 153 , p = 0 . 028 , n = 6; for rice-turtle: t10 = 3 . 292 , p = 0 . 004 , n = 6 ) ( Figure 6a ) . The total N concentration in the soil was also significantly higher at the end than at the beginning of the experiments for the RA treatments ( for rice-carp: t10 = 2 . 765 , p = 0 . 009 , n = 6; for rice crab: t10 = 3 . 204 , p = 0 . 005 , n = 6; for rice-turtle: t10 = 2 . 519 , p = 0 . 015 , n = 6 ) but not for the RM treatments ( for rice-carp: t10 = 0 . 477 , p = 0 . 322 , n = 6; for rice-crab: t10 = 1 . 774 , p = 0 . 053 , n = 6; for rice-turtle: t10 = 0 . 132 , p = 0 . 449 , n = 6 ) ( Figure 6b ) . 3 Discussion Researchers have been investigating whether the use of species interactions can overcome the limitations of monocultures , which depend on high fertilizer and pesticide input and which fail to take advantage of the possible beneficial effects of species interactions ( Kremen et al . , 2012; Ren et al . , 2014; Brooker et al . , 2021 ) . Intercropping is an important and successful way to use biodiversity in agriculture ( Li et al . , 2007; Brooker et al . , 2015; Brooker et al . , 2021 ) . The current study provides another example of exploiting positive species interactions in agriculture . In this case , the interactions involve the use of an aquatic animal ( i . e . carp , crabs , or turtles ) as a partner crop for rice with the goals of stabilizing soil N and increasing the productivity and N-use efficiency of paddy ecosystems . The role of animals in ecosystems has been increasingly recognized ( Vanni , 2002; Dirzo et al . , 2014; Schmitz et al . , 2018 ) . Animals can mediate carbon exchange between ecosystems , can mediate organic matter transformation within ecosystems , and can also drive nutrient cycling ( Schmitz et al . , 2013; Schmitz et al . , 2018; Vanni , 2002; McInturf et al . , 2019 ) . In many aquatic ecosystems , aquatic animals can also significantly affect the plant community , primary productivity , and nutrient availability ( Attayde and Hansson , 2001; Vanni , 2002; Vanni et al . , 2006 ) . In this study , coculturing with aquatic animals ( i . e . carp , crabs , and turtles ) increased rice yield and N-use efficiency , and helped maintain soil N compared to the corresponding rice monoculture . The aquatic animals had two important roles in these cocultured paddy ecosystems . One role involved competition , that is , aquatic animals reduced competitors ( i . e . weeds ) of rice plants and thereby enhanced rice yield . Some freshwater animals ( e . g . carp , crabs , and crayfish ) are omnivores that may consume some living organisms ( e . g . weeds , algae , and phytoplankton ) that compete with rice plants for nutrients . Carp and crabs , for example , can greatly reduce weeds in rice-carp systems ( Frei and Becker , 2005b; Xie et al . , 2011 ) and in rice-crab systems ( Lv et al . , 2011 ) . Our field experiments also showed a reduction ( 45 . 3–51 . 9% ) of weeds in the plots with carp , crabs , or turtles compared to the monoculture plots without herbicide use ( Figure 2 ) . Our dietary reconstruction based on stable-isotope data of δ13C and δ15N showed that carp and crabs obtained 34 . 8–50 . 2% of their total food from the rice field , including weeds , macro-algae , and phytoplankton ( Figure 3 ) ; these results provide indirect evidence that carp and crabs reduced competitors of rice . Although some freshwater animals ( e . g . turtles in our study ) do not prefer to feed on weeds and other vegetative food sources , their activities disturb the paddy soil and thereby inhibit weed germination and growth ( Hu et al . , 2016; He , 2017 ) . A second role of aquatic animals concerned N , that is , aquatic animals increased the recycling of N in these cocultured paddy ecosystems . Many studies have shown that grazers can accelerate nutrient cycling in natural grassland and freshwater ecosystems by increasing nutrient availability in soil and nutrient-use efficiency of plants ( McNaughton et al . , 1997; Atkinson et al . , 2017 ) . In our study , the carp , crabs , and turtles obtained 50 . 2 , 34 . 8 , and 16 . 0% , respectively , of their food from the field rather than from the feed although sufficient feed was applied in our experiment to support the aquatic animals ( Figure 3 ) . Similar to the effects of grazers in the natural ecosystems , the aquatic animals ( carp , crabs , and turtles ) in the paddy ecosystem foraged on weeds , algae , phytoplankton , zooplankton , and benthic invertebrates that used N directly from the paddy field . Once these food source organisms are ingested , the aquatic animals convert them into biomass , feces , and excretions . Because ammonia represents from 75% to 85% of the N in aquatic animal excretions ( Chakraborty and Chakraborty , 1998 ) , the excretions can be directly utilized by rice plants . The aquatic animal feces may release nutrients once they are decomposed , or they may be stored in the form of soil organic matter . Thus , the promotion of N cycling by aquatic animals apparently explains , at least in part , why N-use efficiency of rice was higher and soil N content was more stable in the rice-aquatic animal coculture plots than in the monoculture plots ( Figure 1 ) . In addition to reducing competition and increasing nutrient availability for rice plants via grazing , aquatic animals apparently increased nutrient availability for rice plants by enhancing organic matter decomposition . The percentage of maize leaves ( added to the plots in ‘litter tubes’ ) that remained after 80 days ( as indicated by the percentage of 13C remaining ) was significantly lower in the three RA treatments than in the RM treatment ( Figure 4 ) , indicating that carp , crabs , and turtles promoted organic matter decomposition in the field . Nutrients ( e . g . N and P ) in the organic matter ( e . g . unconsumed feed , aquatic animal feces , and leaf litter ) may be released by decomposition and then used by rice plants or other organisms in the field . Our tracing of feed-15N demonstrated that 13 . 0–35 . 1% of the feed-N was found in the rice plants ( Figure 5a ) . These results suggested that the N in unconsumed or unassimilated feed was released via decomposition and was then used by the rice plants . Unlike traditional rice-fish coculture systems in which no fish feed is applied ( Xie et al . , 2011 ) , the current coculture systems , like those described in this study , often include the application of feed in order to obtain high aquatic animal yields ( Hu et al . , 2016 ) . Whether such feed affects rice yield and soil fertility was also assessed in our study . The mesocosm experiments showed that 1 . 27 ± 0 . 09 g m–2 ( rice-carp ) , 0 . 36 ± 0 . 09 g m–2 ( rice-crab ) , and 1 . 12 ± 0 . 10 g . m–2 ( rice-turtle ) of feed-15N accumulated in the rice plant biomass ( grain and straw ) ( Figure 5b ) . The mesocosm experiments also showed that feed-15N accumulated in the soil ( Figure 6 ) . These results suggest that N use by cocultured rice and animals can be complementary and can increase N-use efficiency . The results also suggest that the unconsumed or unassimilated feed can function as a fertilizer for rice and can thereby increase the rice yield and the N content in the soil . In addition to N , phosphorus ( P ) also entered rice-animal coculture systems via feed in our study ( Appendix 2—table 1 ) . Like N , P is important for rice growth and yield ( Ahmed et al . , 2017 ) . In our 4-year field experiments , the level of soil total P was similar at the end vs . the beginning under both rice monocultures and rice-animal cocultures ( Appendix 1—figure 3 ) , but rice yields were higher and more P was removed with the harvested products with coculture than with monoculture ( Appendix 2—table 2 ) . It follows that the P input via feed may contribute to the rice yield increase and the maintenance of soil P in the coculture systems . The current results increase our understanding of how agricultural systems can use species diversity to increase sustainability . Planting diverse wild or crop species in field margins has been found to improve the management of crop pests and their natural enemies ( Bianchi et al . , 2006; Tschumi et al . , 2016 ) . Overyielding often occurs in intercropping systems when the coexisting crops benefit each other or when one benefits the others ( Snapp et al . , 2010; Kremen et al . , 2012; Li et al . , 2014; Ren et al . , 2014; Brooker et al . , 2021 ) . In our study , the rice plants and the three aquatic animals ( i . e . carp , crabs , and turtles ) have a similar growing period and have similar water and temperature requirements , making it possible to develop a rice–aquatic animal partnership . Although carp , crabs , and turtles differ in biological traits and feeding activities , they play similar roles in increasing rice yield and N-use efficiency , and in stabilizing soil N . Rice paddies provide food for half of the world’s population ( Gross and Zhao , 2014; Edzesi et al . , 2016 ) , and also provide other ecosystem services , including groundwater recharge , flood control , water purification , and the conservation of biodiversity , landscapes , and human cultures ( Bouman et al . , 2007; Natuhara , 2013; Wang et al . , 2018 ) . Modern rice farming currently faces the great challenge of how to increase yield while minimizing negative environmental effects ( Mueller et al . , 2012; Chen et al . , 2014 ) . Our study suggests that this challenge can be at least partially met by adding certain species of aquatic animals to rice monocultures . The resulting cocultures could produce more food ( rice grain and fish ) with less fertilizer and pesticides than rice monocultures . In our field experiment , an average annual aquatic animal yield ranging from 0 . 52 to 2 . 57 t ha–1 was produced from the rice fields ( Figure 1 ) , suggesting that local farmers can obtain more income from their paddy fields . Moreover , the prices for grain and aquatic animal products from these cocultures were higher than from the local rice monoculture ( Hu et al . , 2016 ) . Although costs of the cocultures are higher than the costs of monoculture because of the feed input and increased labor required for the management of two species , net income was still higher for cocultures than for monocultures because of the higher prices of the products and the reduced use of fertilizers and pesticides ( Hu et al . , 2016; Wang et al . , 2018 ) . Over the last two decades in China , the increased income has greatly increased farmer enthusiasm for the rice–aquatic animal cocultures ( Tang et al . , 2020 ) . While our current study and other previous studies have shown the positive effects of rice-aquatic animal coculture on rice production , farmer income , and soil N , possible negative effects resulting from the input of feed and the increased decomposition rate should be considered . These potential negative effects include eutrophication and increased carbon emission . Previous studies , however , found that rice-aquatic animal coculture would not cause serious N eutrophication in the field when the target aquatic animal yields were set below the following thresholds: 2 . 11 ± 0 . 22 t ha–1 for rice-carp , 0 . 66 ± 0 . 08 t ha–1 for rice-crab , and 3 . 62 ± 0 . 25 t ha–1 for rice-turtle coculture systems ( Hu et al . , 2013; Zhang et al . , 2016; Hu et al . , 2016 ) . The effects of rice-aquatic animal coculture on carbon emission ( e . g . CH4 emission ) varied among reports ( Ding et al . , 2020; Sun et al . , 2021 ) . Some experiments indicated that CH4 emissions were lower in rice–aquatic animal coculture systems than in rice monocultures ( Yuan et al . , 2009; Sun et al . , 2021 ) , while other experiments indicated that CH4 emissions were higher in rice–aquatic animal coculture systems than in rice monocultures ( Frei and Becker , 2005a; Wang et al . , 2019 ) . These differences in CH4 emission could be caused by differences in aquatic animals , natural environments , and field management ( Ding et al . , 2020; Dai et al . , 2022 ) . In our study , the aquatic animals increased organic matter decomposition in the paddy field ( Figure 4 ) , suggesting that the release of nutrients but also of CO2 would be higher with coculture than with monoculture . In our previous survey , the three typical types of coculture ( i . e . rice-carp , rice-crab , and rice-turtle ) were compared in terms of financial returns for the farmers . Financial returns were higher for rice-turtle systems ( which is the most common type of coculture in south China ) than for rice-carp and rice-crab systems ( Hu et al . , 2016; Wang et al . , 2018 ) . In addition to these three types of coculture , other types ( e . g . rice-prawn/crayfish , rice-frogs , and rice-ducks ) are also practiced in China and in other Asian countries ( Hu et al . , 2015; Ahmed and Turchini , 2021 ) . In some areas , farmers apply feed to obtain higher animal yield from the cocultures , and the main components of the feed are residues of soybean after the oil has been extracted . Given the millions of hectares of rice fields with suitable conditions for rice-aquatic animal coculture , the cropland available for soybean production and the integration of rice-aquatic animal coculture with soybean production should be taken into account before substantial increases in coculture area are promoted . 4 Materials and methods Three coculture systems , namely rice-carp , rice-crab , and rice-turtle ( Figure 7 ) , were studied . These coculture systems have been developed and adapted to different rice-growing areas in China ( Hu et al . , 2016 ) . The rice-carp coculture system , for example , has a long history and is widely practiced in south China ( Xie et al . , 2011; Wang et al . , 2018 ) . In recent decades , the rice-crab coculture system has been rapidly developing in northeastern China ( Xu et al . , 2019 ) , and the rice-turtle coculture system has been rapidly developing in south China ( Zhang et al . , 2017 ) . In these systems , the aquatic animals ( i . e . carp , crabs , and softshell turtles , Figure 7 ) are partnered with rice plants during the whole rice-growing period ( 130–150 days ) and are harvested every year when the rice matures . These three aquatic animals are economically important , and are usually cultured in fish ponds or paddy fields by local farmers . The meat of all these species is a popular food of the local people . To increase the growth and quality of aquatic animals in coculture systems , farmers often apply feed in the form of pellets ( Appendix 2—table 1 ) . The common carp ( Cyprinus carpio ) has adapted to paddy habitats and is predominantly used for rice-carp coculture ( Figure 7A , Xie et al . , 2011; Wang et al . , 2018 ) . The growing season for rice-carp systems is usually from late May to early October ( ca . 125 days ) . Carp fry ( ca . 40 g each ) are often released into the rice field 1 week after rice is transplanted . The carp , which do not feed on rice plants , live in the paddy field until the rice plants are mature , at which time the carp are harvested . In the current study , pellet feed ( 5 . 37% N ) was applied each day at ca . 6:30 am . The daily amount of feed was initially set as 4% of the fish fresh weight and was increased by 3% every 10 days afterwards . By carp harvest , the total inputs of the feed and feed-N for RA plots were 1 . 46 t ha–1 and 78 . 41 kg ha–1 , respectively ( Appendix 2—table 1 ) . After they are harvested from paddy fields , the carp are directly used as food or are temporary cultured in fish ponds until they are used as food . The Chinese mitten crab ( Eriocheir sinensis Milne-Edwards ) is used in the rice-crab system and is also well adapted to the paddy environment ( Figure 7B , Xu et al . , 2019 ) . In the rice-crab system , the growing season is from middle May to middle October ( ca . 150 days ) . The juvenile crabs ( ca . 1 . 15 g each ) are released into rice fields 1 week after rice is transplanted . The juvenile crabs do not feed on rice plants and ‘live’ together with rice plants until harvest . The crabs molt several times during their time in the paddy field . In the current study , pellet feed ( 4 . 52% N ) was applied once each day at ca . 6:30 am . The daily amount of feed was initially set as 3–5% of the crab fresh weight and was increased by 3% every 10 days afterwards . By crab harvest , the total inputs of the feed and feed-N for RA plots were 1 . 78 t ha–1 and 80 . 46 kg ha–1 , respectively ( Appendix 2—table 1 ) . After they are harvested from the paddy fields , the crabs are used as food or are placed in ponds and are used as a source of crabs for the next year . The Chinese softshell turtle ( Pelodiscus sinensis ) is often cultured in paddy fields by local farmers in southeastern China ( Figure 7C ) . The turtles are omnivores but prefer animal diets ( He , 2017 ) . In this rice-turtle system , the growing season is from middle June to early November ( ca . 140 days ) . The baby turtles ( ca . 150 g each ) are released into the field 1 week after rice is transplanted . The turtles remain with the rice plants for the whole rice-growth period . In the current study , pellet feed ( 6 . 51% N ) was applied twice per day at ca . 7:00 am and 5:00 pm throughout the coculture period . The daily amount of feed was initially set as 0 . 5%–1 . 0% of the turtle fresh weight but was increased as the turtles grew . By turtle harvest , the total inputs of the feed and feed-N for RA plots were 1 . 62 t ha–1 and 105 . 46 kg ha–1 , respectively . ( Appendix 2—table 1 ) . After they are harvested from paddy fields , the turtles are used as food or are temporarily cultured in fish ponds until they are used as food . In the following experiments , the samples of all aquatic animals ( i . e . carp , crabs , and softshell turtles ) were collected and measured in accordance with the approved guidelines of the Zhejiang University Experimental Animal Management Committee ( reference number SYXK ( Zhe ) 2018–0016 ) . Details on the handling of animal samples were described in the Methods section . Each of three field experiments ( one each for rice-carp , rice-crab , and rice-turtle systems ) was conducted for 4 years ( 2017–2020 ) at a site ( one system per site ) where the particular system was widely practiced . The three sites are described in the supporting information ( see Appendix 3 ) . All three experiments used a completely randomized block design with two treatments: rice monoculture ( RM ) and rice-aquatic animal coculture ( RA ) with feed addition for aquatic animal ( Appendix 2—table 1 ) . Each treatment at each site was represented by six replicate plots with a size of 0 . 01 ha per plot for rice-carp and rice-crabs , and 80 m2 per plot for rice-turtles . No chemicals were used to control weeds , pests , or diseases during the experiments . The plot size and detailed experimental procedures are described in Appendix 4 . In 2018 , the stable-isotope 13C labeling method was used to determine the organic matter decomposition rate in the three field experiments ( Cheng et al . , 2012 ) . ‘Litter tubes’ containing maize ( Zea mays L . ) leaves enriched with 13C ( δ13C –13 . 6‰ ) were used as described in Appendix 5 . The percentage of 13C remaining in the litter tubes after 40 and 80 days represented the decomposition rate . We used a stable isotope ( 13C and 15N ) technique to determine how the aquatic animals ( i . e . carp , crabs , or turtles ) used food resources ( e . g . weeds , zoobenthos , zooplankton , and phytoplankton ) in the field ( Michener and Schell , 1994 ) . During the rice growing period in 2019 , we collected living organisms that were consumed by the aquatic animals in each of the three experiments ( Caut et al . , 2009; Guo et al . , 2016 ) ( see Appendix 6 ) . Before and after the experiments , we also collected muscles from the aquatic animals ( carp , crabs , or turtles ) ( see Appendix 7 ) . We ground all dried samples of food sources and aquatic animals and analyzed their isotopic δ value and content ( 13C and 15N ) . The δ value was calculated as ( [Rsample /Rstandard]−1 ) × 1000 , where R represents 13C:12C or 15N:14N ( Peterson and Fry , 1987 ) . Dietary contributions of input feed and potential food sources from the rice field were analyzed by stable isotopic dietary reconstruction with the R package ‘siar’ ( Phillips and Gregg , 2003; Phillips et al . , 2005; Parnell and Jackson , 2011; R Core Team , 2021 ) . The discrimination factors of 13C and 15N for carp , crabs , and turtles in dietary reconstruction were previously determined ( see Appendix 8 ) . Three weeks before rice was harvested in each experimental year ( from 2017 to 2020 ) , 5 quadrats ( 1 m2 ) were randomly placed in each plot to evaluate weed infestation . For each quadrat , the aboveground dry weed biomass was measured . In each experimental year ( from 2017 to 2020 ) , rice and aquatic animals were harvested from the whole experimental plots when rice plants matured . Rice yield was determined by manually harvesting entire plots . Rice grain was air-dried and weighed . Rice yield was estimated as tons of air-dried grain per ha . One week before rice was harvested , aquatic animals were collected from entire plots by driving them into the corner of field as the water was drained . Yield was expressed as tons of fresh aquatic animal biomass per ha . At harvest in each year of the experiments , samples of rice plants and aquatic animals were collected for determining N content . Five hills of rice were collected in each plot . The separated grain and straw were oven-dried at <65℃ to a constant weight . The aquatic animal samples were kept in water for 24 hr to permit the emptying of intestinal contents . The clean aquatic animal samples were oven-dried at 105℃ to a constant weight . Both rice and aquatic animal samples were ground with a ball mill ( RETSCHMM 400 , Germany ) . The N content in rice straw and grain and in the aquatic animals was measured by the Kjeldahl method ( Bremmer and Mulvaney , 1982 ) . Every experimental year , soil samples ( 0–20 cm depth ) were collected immediately after harvest from each plot . All soil samples were air dried . Soil organic matter ( SOM ) content was determined by the K2Cr2O7 oxidation method , and total nitrogen ( N ) content was determined by the Kjeldahl method ( Lu , 1999 ) . We used the data collected in 2018 to estimate apparent N-use efficiency ( ANUE ) by calculating percentage of the input N that was used by rice and aquatic animals ( Moll et al . , 1982; Mayer et al . , 2015; Zhang et al . , 2017 ) as follows: ( 1 ) ANUE %=NyNs×100 where Ny is the total amount of N contained in the grain and straw of rice plants , and in the aquatic animals that were removed from the paddy system , and Ns is the total input of fertilizer-N and feed-N . Ny was determined by multiplying the biomass of rice ( grain and straw ) and aquatic animals by the percentage of N in rice and aquatic animals . We assumed that the natural N input ( e . g . N fixed by bacteria , N in the irrigation water , and atmospheric N deposition ) was similar between RM and RA plots , and natural N input was therefore not included in our estimations of ANUE . Statistical analysis was conducted using the GLM in SPSS ( V . 20 . 0 , RRID: SCR_002865 ) . All data were subjected to a homogeneity test . If the data did not meet the assumptions of normality and homogeneity , they were log-transformed before analysis . For each field experiment , ANOVAs with a split-plot design ( i . e . treatment RM and RA as the main plots and experimental years as the sub-plots ) were performed on rice yields , total soil N content , ANUE , and weed biomass . For RM or RA plots , total N in the soil at the beginning and end of the experiment were compared by using paired t-tests ( SPSS V . 20 . 0 , RRID: SCR_002865 ) . To determine whether unconsumed and unassimilated feed-N is used by aquatic animals in rice-carp , rice-crab , or rice-turtle systems , we conducted three independent mesocosm experiments ( one for each kind of system ) at the Experimental Station of Zhejiang University in Deqing County , Zhejiang Province ( 30°33′N , 119°32′E . ) . The mesocosm experiments were conducted in 2019 . The fate of feed-N was traced by using stable-isotope 15N-labeled feed in each mesocosm experiment . For rice-carp and rice-crab experiments , each mesocosm was a cylindrical , 1017 L plastic stock tank . Intact soil ( 300 L ) from a corresponding rice field was added to each mesocosm to a depth of 30 cm . The mesocosms were placed in a rice paddy field ( the corresponding fields that were used for the three field experiments ) so that their bottoms were 20 cm below the soil surface , and the top of each microcosm was above the water line . For the rice-turtle system , 2 m × 2 m plots were established in a rice paddy field . Each plot had an independent water inlet and outlet and was separated from water mixing by concrete ridges . Each of the three mesocosm experiments had a completely randomized block design with six replicate blocks . The treatments were rice monoculture ( RM ) and rice-aquatic animals coculture ( RA ) . For the RM and RA , varieties of rice and aquatic animal species were the same as in the field experiment . The detailed procedures for each mesocosm experiment are provided in Appendix 9 . Because soybean is the major raw ingredient of feeds for the three aquatic animals ( carp , crabs , and turtles ) , we first labeled soybean powder with 15N ( see Appendix 10 ) . We then mixed the labeled soybean powder with the general feed of carp , crabs , and turtles as indicated in Appendix 2—table 3 . At harvest , samples of rice plants , aquatic animals ( carp , crabs , and turtles ) , and soil were collected from each mesocosm ( see Appendix 11 ) . The 15N content in all samples of rice plants , aquatic animals , and soil was quantified with a ThermoFinnigan DELTA Plus continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer . We calculated the contribution of feed-N to total rice biomass-N with a linear mixing model ( Phillips and Gregg , 2003 ) : ( 2 ) δ15NRM×a+δ15Nfeed×b=δ15NRA ( 3 ) a+b=1 ( 4 ) b= ( δ15NRA−δ15NRM ) / ( δ15Nfeed−δ15NRM ) where a is the contribution of soil N to rice total biomass-N; b is the contribution of feed-N to rice total biomass-N; δ15NRM is the δ15N value of the rice plants in the RM treatment; δ15Nfeed is the δ15N value of 15N-labeled feed; and δ15NRAS is the δ15N value of rice plants in the RA treatment . For RM or RA mesocosms , δ15N and total N in the soil at the beginning and end of the experiment were compared by using one-tailed t-tests under the assumption that δ15N and total N in the soil would increase after the experiments ( SPSS V . 20 . 0 , RRID: SCR_002865 ) ."}
{"doi": "elife-10719-v1", "abstract": "Dopamine signals reward in animal brains . A single presentation of a sugar reward to Drosophila activates distinct subsets of dopamine neurons that independently induce short- and long-term olfactory memories ( STM and LTM , respectively ) . In this study , we show that a recurrent reward circuit underlies the formation and consolidation of LTM . This feedback circuit is composed of a single class of reward-signaling dopamine neurons ( PAM-α1 ) projecting to a restricted region of the mushroom body ( MB ) , and a specific MB output cell type , MBON-α1 , whose dendrites arborize that same MB compartment . Both MBON-α1 and PAM-α1 neurons are required during the acquisition and consolidation of appetitive LTM . MBON-α1 additionally mediates the retrieval of LTM , which is dependent on the dopamine receptor signaling in the MB α/β neurons . Our results suggest that a reward signal transforms a nascent memory trace into a stable LTM using a feedback circuit at the cost of memory specificity .", "plain language summary": "An animal that finds particularly nutritious and palatable food will often develop a long-lasting memory—even if they experience that event only once . One example of this is the ability of the fruit fly Drosophila to form a long-term association between a sugar reward and a specific odor that was present when they received the reward . The consumption of sugar triggers the release of a chemical called dopamine on specific compartments of a brain structure called the mushroom body . Dopamine then acts to modify the connection between cells called “Kenyon cells” , which encode specific odors , and the neurons that send signals out from the mushroom body ( called MBONs ) . The result is the formation of a memory that links the odor with the reward . However , little is known about how this process differs for long-term vs . short-term memories , and how it can occur when the fly has experienced the odor and reward together on only a single occasion . To find out , Ichinose et al . combined behavioral testing of fruit flies with genetics . The results confirmed that the dopamine neurons and the MBONs that project to a single compartment of the mushroom body , called α1 , are both required for the formation of long-term odor-reward memories , but not their short-term equivalents . These neurons are called PAM-α1 and MBON-α1 , respectively . Unexpectedly , anatomical data revealed that PAM-α1 dopamine neurons receive input from MBON-α1; that is , long-term memory formation involves a feedback circuit: from PAM-α1 to Kenyon cells , then to MBON-α1 and back to PAM-α1 . Blocking feedback from the MBON-α1 onto the PAM-α1 neurons shortly after odor-reward training disrupted long-term memory formation . Conversely , blocking feedback at a later stage did not . This suggests that prolonged activation of PAM-α1 by MBON-α1 helps to strengthen newly established memories , converting them into memories that will last for a long time . The discovery of a specific circuit that supports long-term , but not short-term , memory formation in fruit flies is consistent with evidence of distinct mechanisms underlying these processes in mammals . Further work is now required to determine whether feedback circuits similar to those in fruit flies also contribute to reward-based learning in other animals .", "article": "1 Introduction Environmentally relevant information , such as poison or food , can trigger formation of long-term memory ( LTM ) in a single association event ( Garcia et al . , 1955; Alexander et al . , 1984 ) . Because LTM formation is energetically costly ( Mery and Kawecki , 2005; Placais and Preat , 2013 ) , it is advantageous for animals to refer to surrounding conditions when selecting what information to retain as stable LTM . Appetitive olfactory learning in Drosophila melanogaster provides an opportunity to uncover the mechanisms underlying such integration of information , as a single presentation of nutritious sugar and an odor drives robust short-term memory ( STM ) and LTM , while non-nutritious sugar induces only STM ( Krashes and Waddell , 2008; Colomb et al . , 2009; Burke and Waddell , 2011 ) . In Drosophila , sugar reward is mediated by a group of dopamine neurons called the protocerebral anterior medial ( PAM ) cluster ( Burke et al . , 2012; Liu et al . , 2012 ) . Artificial activation of the PAM cluster neurons in the presence of odor drives robust appetitive STM and LTM formation . Recent studies subdivided the PAM cluster neurons into STM- and LTM-inducing cell types and identified several cell types responsible for LTM formation , including PAM-α1 ( Huetteroth et al . , 2015; Yamagata et al . , 2015 ) . Interestingly , the induced LTM is undetectable immediately after conditioning but gradually develops with time ( Das et al . , 2014; Huetteroth et al . , 2015; Yamagata et al . , 2015 ) . Dopamine reward signals are conveyed by PAM cluster neurons to a brain structure called mushroom body ( MB ) , where the convergence of the reward and the odor is assumed to take place ( Schwaerzel et al . , 2003; Krashes et al . , 2007; Trannoy et al . , 2011; Cervantes-Sandoval et al . , 2013; Huang et al . , 2013 ) . The MB represents odors using a sparse subset of ∼2000 intrinsic neurons , Kenyon cells ( KCs ) ( Turner et al . , 2008; Aso et al . , 2009; Honegger et al . , 2011; Campbell et al . , 2013 ) . KCs send parallel fibers to form lobe structures , where multiple MB-output neuron ( MBON ) types elaborate spatially segregated dendritic arbors ( Aso et al . , 2014a ) . The KC-MBON synapses are presumed to be modified in the course of memory formation by the reinforcing dopamine neurons ( Tomchik and Davis , 2009; Gervasi et al . , 2010; Sejourne et al . , 2011; Cervantes-Sandoval et al . , 2013; Placais et al . , 2013; Boto et al . , 2014 ) . While there has been progress on the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying LTM formation resulting from repetitive conditioning ( Pagani et al . , 2009; Placais et al . , 2012; Philips et al . , 2013 ) , how a single presentation of a reward can trigger LTM remains to be understood . Here , we identify and behaviorally characterize a recurrent reward circuit that is essential for appetitive LTM formation and consolidation . The recurrent circuit consists of PAM-α1 dopamine neurons and a single MBON type , MBON-α1 . This recurrent dopamine reward circuit may provide insights into a general mechanism for LTM formation . 2 Results PAM-α1 delivers reward signals essential for appetitive LTM formation ( Yamagata et al . , 2015 ) . To understand the neuronal circuit that regulates rewards for LTM formation , we first sought to anatomically identify the input neurons to PAM-α1 . The presynaptic terminals of PAM-α1 are localized to the basal compartment of the MB α lobe ( α1 ) ( Liu et al . , 2012 ) , whereas the dendrites stretch horizontally across the superior medial , intermediate , and lateral protocerebra ( SMP , SIP , and SLP , respectively ) ( Aso et al . , 2014a; Yamagata et al . , 2015 ) ( Figure 1A , B , H ) . By segmenting the dendrites of PAM-α1 in confocal images ( Aso et al . , 2014a ) , we queried a database of GAL4 expression patterns ( Jenett et al . , 2012 ) to computationally search for candidate upstream neurons . Strikingly , one of the input candidates we identified was the output neurons from the α1 compartment of the MB ( MBON-α1 ) ( Figure 1C , D ) . Transgenic expression of a presynaptic marker ( Robinson et al . , 2002 ) by MB310C-GAL4 revealed that the presynaptic terminals of MBON-α1 lie in close apposition to the dendrites of PAM-α1 ( Figure 1E , I ) . The terminals of MBON-α1 were immunoreactive for the vesicular glutamate transporter ( Figure 1F ) ( Daniels et al . , 2008 ) but not for markers for GABAergic or cholinergic neurons ( glutamic acid decarboxylase [Jackson et al . , 1990] or choline acetyltransferase [Takagawa and Salvaterra , 1996] , respectively ) ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) , consistent with MBON-α1 being glutamatergic ( Aso et al . , 2014a ) . Differential labeling of the individual MBON-α1 neurons in the same brain ( Nern et al . , 2015 ) revealed that MBON-α1 comprises two cells with very similar morphology ( Figure 1G ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 10719 . 003Figure 1 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 10719 . 004 To precisely determine the relative arrangement of PAM-α1 and MBON-α1 neurites , we performed a double-labeling experiment using R72D01-LexA , which labels PAM-α1 , and the split-GAL4 driver MB310C-GAL4 , which labels MBON-α1 ( Aso et al . , 2014a ) . Confocal images revealed that the processes of MBON-α1 and PAM-α1 substantially intermingled both in the SIP and SLP , and in the α1 compartment of the MB—the input and output sites of PAM-α1 , respectively ( Figure 2A–E , Figure 2—figure supplement 1 , Video 1 ) . To observe these processes in SIP and SLP in even greater detail , we employed a microscope with a super resolution detection system and found bouton-like structures of MBON-α1 attached to the dendrites of PAM-α1 ( Figure 2B–D ) . Furthermore , a GFP reconstitution across synaptic partners ( GRASP ) ( Feinberg et al . , 2008; Gordon and Scott , 2009 ) experiment using R72D01-LexA and MB310C-GAL4 revealed strong GRASP signals in SIP , SLP , and the α1 compartment ( Figure 2F ) . This further supports the close juxtaposition between PAM-α1 and MBON-α1 . 10 . 7554/eLife . 10719 . 005Figure 2 . Processes of PAM-α1 and MBON-α1 intermingle each other .

We examined the requirement of PAM-α1 and MBON-α1 by expressing a temperature-sensitive dominant negative dynamin , Shibirets1 ( Kitamoto , 2001 ) using the split-GAL4 drivers MB299B-GAL4 and MB310C-GAL4 ( Figure 3B , F ) . MB299B-GAL4 has strong expression in PAM-α1 ( Aso et al . , 2014a; Yamagata et al . , 2015 ) ( Figure 3B ) . Consistent with our previous results ( Yamagata et al . , 2015 ) , the blockade of PAM-α1 during conditioning did not significantly affect STM ( Figure 3C ) , but led to a severe impairment of sucrose-rewarded LTM ( Figure 3D ) . The unimpaired performance in appetitive STM demonstrates that flies of these genotypes have normal sugar and odor perception at the restrictive temperature . Intriguingly , we found a similar preferential impairment of LTM upon the blockade of MBON-α1 , using MB310C-GAL4 driver ( Figure 3H ) . The same blockade did not significantly impair STM ( Figure 3G ) . We confirmed the preferential requirement of MBON-α1 for LTM using another driver , MB323B-GAL4 ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1A ) , and obtained similar results ( Figure 3G , H ) ; neither MB310C/UAS-shi nor MB323B/UAS-shi flies showed a significant LTM impairment when trained and tested at the permissive temperature ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1B ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 10719 . 008Figure 3 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 10719 . 009 We next examined whether glutamatergic input to PAM-α1 is required for LTM formation by down-regulating the expression of glutamate receptors using MB299B-GAL4 . For efficient and cell-type-specific manipulation , we used UAS-RNAi fly strains based on the shRNA technique ( Ni et al . , 2011 ) . Intriguingly , knocking down either dNR-1 or dNR-2 , which together form the functional NMDA receptor ( Xia et al . , 2005 ) , impaired LTM ( Figure 4C ) but not STM ( Figure 4B ) . This preferential requirement in LTM is similar to the blockade of MBON-α1 and PAM-α1 , suggesting the direct glutamatergic feedback . 10 . 7554/eLife . 10719 . 010Figure 4 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 10719 . 010 Given that thermogenetic stimulation of PAM-α1 with a temperature-sensitive cation channel dTrpA1 ( Hamada et al . , 2008 ) can provide the reward signal for LTM formation ( Yamagata et al . , 2015 ) , we asked if activation of MBON-α1 would also be capable of inducing appetitive LTM ( Figure 5A ) . Indeed , we found appetitive LTM upon thermo-activation of MBON-α1 in the presence of an odor ( Figure 5B ) . These results , together with the consistent requirements of MBON-α1 and NMDAR-signaling in PAM-α1 , are most easily explained if the glutamatergic feedback regulation from MBON-α1 augments dopamine reward signaling by PAM-α1 . 10 . 7554/eLife . 10719 . 011Figure 5 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 10719 . 011 Several lines of evidence suggest that D1-like dopamine receptor ( DopR1 ) is required in KCs for appetitive memory ( Kim et al . , 2007; Liu et al . , 2012; Boto et al . , 2014 ) . However , previous studies focused on only STM . To identify the receiving site of dopamine for LTM formation , we knocked down DopR1 , either in α/β KCs or in MBON-α1 , the potential targets of dopamine from PAM-α1 , and measured appetitive LTM . To target the expression specifically to the α/β KCs , we employed two driver lines , MB008B-GAL4 ( Aso et al . , 2014a; Vogt et al . , 2014 ) ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1A ) and c739-GAL4 ( Yang et al . , 1995 ) . Interestingly , knocking down DopR1 in the α/β KCs , using c739-GAL4 or MB008B-GAL4 , resulted in a severe impairment of appetitive LTM ( Figure 6A ) while leaving STM unaffected ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1B ) . These results are consistent with the observation that the coincidence detector adenylate cyclase encoded by rutabaga , thought to act downstream of the dopamine receptor ( Tomchik and Davis , 2009; Gervasi et al . , 2010; Boto et al . , 2014 ) , functions for LTM in the α/β KCs ( Trannoy et al . , 2011 ) . On the other hand , knocking down DopR1 in MBON-α1 did not significantly impair either appetitive LTM or STM ( Figure 6A and Figure 6—figure supplement 1B ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 10719 . 012Figure 6 . α/β KCs receive dopamine signals through DopR1 for LTM formation . ( A ) Knocking down DopR1 in α/β Kenyon cells ( KCs ) but not in MBON-α1 impairs appetitive LTM ( n = 17 , 10 , 11 , 11 , 18 , 12 , 7 , 12 , 27 ) .

( B ) Knocking down DopR1 in α/β KCs or MBON-α1 does not impair appetitive STM , suggesting normal sugar or odor perception of these flies ( n = 7 , 7 , 12 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 9 , 9 , 22 ) . Bar graphs are mean ± s . e . m . n . s . : p > 0 . 05 . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 10719 . 013 To further localize the role of DopR1 in KCs , we performed a rescue experiment , using a piggyBac insertion mutant , dumb2 ( Liu et al . , 2012; Qin et al . , 2012 ) . dumb2 mutant flies showed severely impaired appetitive LTM . Targeting wild-type DopR1 gene expression in KCs fully rescued the defects ( Figure 6B ) . Together , although we cannot exclude the possible role of other dopamine receptors in MBON-α1 , we propose that DopR1-mediated memory trace is formed in α/β KCs not in MBON-α1 . Previous studies have highlighted the role of the output from α/β KCs for memory retrieval ( Krashes et al . , 2007; Trannoy et al . , 2011; Cervantes-Sandoval et al . , 2013; Perisse et al . , 2013 ) . Given the requirement of MBON-α1 for the acquisition of appetitive LTM , the output of the α/β KCs during conditioning may be important for LTM formation . To test this possibility , we blocked the output of the α/β KCs with Shits1 . Strikingly , the blockade of the α/β KCs during conditioning significantly impaired appetitive LTM , but not STM ( Figure 7A , B ) , similar to the blockade of PAM-α1 and MBON-α1 ( Figure 3 ) . When the flies were trained and tested at the permissive temperature , no significant impairment of appetitive LTM was observed ( Figure 7—figure supplement 1 ) . The requirement for α/β KC synaptic signaling during LTM formation supports our model that MBON-α1 provides information about the memory trace , formed in the α/β KCs , to the reward signaling PAM-α1 neurons . 10 . 7554/eLife . 10719 . 014Figure 7 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 10719 . 015 If the nascent memory trace in α/β KCs is communicated by MBON-α1 during conditioning , MBON-α1 might also convey the read-out of LTM . Intriguingly , when MBON-α1 was blocked only during the test phase of LTM , we found a severe impairment of conditioned odor approach ( Figure 8A ) . In contrast , the blockade of PAM-α1 during LTM retrieval did not have a significant effect ( Figure 8B ) . These results imply that MBON-α1 plays a dual role in both formation and retrieval of LTM; different post-synaptic targets of MBON-α1 would be used in these two roles , with the recurrent PAM-α1-MBON-α1 circuit selectively involved in LTM formation . 10 . 7554/eLife . 10719 . 016Figure 8 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 10719 . 016 The glutamatergic input from MBON-α1 might provide an excitatory feedback on the PAM-α1 neurons via the NMDA receptor thereby prolonging the dopamine release after the cessation of sugar presentation . If this model were correct , the post-training blockade of the feedback circuit might be expected to impair appetitive LTM . Consistent with this idea , blocking any component of the feedback circuit for 1 hr immediately following conditioning resulted in a significant impairment of appetitive LTM ( Figure 9A , C , E ) , whereas the same blockade 22 hr after training did not ( Figure 9B , D , F ) . These results strongly suggest that the recurrent circuit has an ongoing activity , which plays a key role in early phase of appetitive LTM consolidation . 10 . 7554/eLife . 10719 . 017Figure 9 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 10719 . 017 Prolonged dopamine release in the absence of odor may also modulate KCs that do not respond to the rewarded odor . If so , the odor specificity of appetitive LTM might be compromised compared to STM . Thus , we measured the generalization profile of STM and LTM by testing with the graded mixtures of ‘contaminating’ odors ( Figure 10 ) . Odor mixtures were created by systematically varying the relative contents of the contaminant ( trained odor: contaminant = 100:0 , 80:20 , 60:40 , 40:60 , 20:80 , or 0:100 ) : if the memory is specific to the trained odor , the performance quickly decreases with the increasing contaminant ratio . Strikingly , the performance decline is shallower in LTM compared to STM ( Figure 10C , D ) . We confirmed these results with another set of odorants , suggesting that compromised stimulus specificity in LTM is general ( Figure 10—figure supplement 1 ) . Considering that the only difference between these groups is the retention time , there may be a trade-off between consolidation and specificity , possibly due to the prolonged dopamine release in the MB following memory acquisition . 10 . 7554/eLife . 10719 . 018Figure 10 .

( C , D ) The performance index declined more sharply with the increasing contamination ratio in STM ( C; n = 16 for each ) than in LTM ( D; n = 24 for each ) .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 10719 . 019 3 Discussion Prior studies on the role of MBONs in learning and memory have focused on memory retrieval ( Sejourne et al . , 2011; Pai et al . , 2013; Placais et al . , 2013; Aso et al . , 2014b ) . Here , we extend the known role of MBONs and show that MB output through MBON-α1 is required not only for the retrieval , but also for the acquisition and early consolidation of long-term appetitive olfactory memory . This unanticipated aspect of the MB output for LTM formation appears to function through a recurrent loop ( Figure 11 ) : MBON-α1 dendrites and the terminals of PAM-α1 occupy the same MB compartment ( Aso et al . , 2014a ) ; the DopR1 dopamine receptor is required in the KCs of that compartment ( Figure 6 ) ; MBON-α1 in turn sends a portion of its outputs to the dendrites of PAM-α1 ( Figures 1 , 2 ) closing the loop; synaptic signaling by all three cell types—α/β KCs , MBON-α1 , and PAM-α1—is required during LTM formation and consolidation ( Figures 3 , 7 , 9 ) . These findings strongly support our model that feedback signals from α/β KCs , mediated by MBON-α1 , play a critical role in controlling the rewarding dopamine signals from PAM-α1 ( Figure 11 ) . Inhibitory recurrent circuits in the MBs have been implicated in appetitive learning of honeybees ( Grunewald , 1999a , 1999b ) . Our present study reveals a new circuit motif , a feedback circuit that is required for dopamine neurons to provide reinforcement during appetitive LTM formation . 10 . 7554/eLife . 10719 . 020Figure 11 . Recurrent reward circuit drives appetitive LTM formation . Feedback circuit model of appetitive LTM formation . Neuronal signal of a sugar reward mediated by PAM-α1 converges with olfactory information in the α/β KCs . The coincidental signal is read out through MBON-α1 to give glutamatergic feedback onto PAM-α1 for the gain control of the dopamine release . Appetitive LTM is read out through MBON-α1 to activate other downstream targets . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 10719 . 020 Dopamine has been thought to simply relay rewarding or punitive stimuli ( Gerber et al . , 2004; Waddell , 2013 ) . However , our results call into question this prevailing circuit model . More specifically , PAM-α1 might integrate simultaneous inputs from sugar perception and the nascent memory trace to augment and sustain the dopamine release to gate LTM formation ( Figure 11 ) . The requirement of the NMDA receptor in PAM-α1 ( Figure 4 ) further supports this model . Such integration by PAM-α1 might enhance the reward gain selectively in relevant sensory environments . In other words , the reinforcing signal for LTM formation may depend on the presence of other sensory stimuli ( e . g . , odor ) . As LTM formation is energetically costly ( Mery and Kawecki , 2005; Placais and Preat , 2013; Musso et al . , 2015 ) , this gain control of the reinforcing signal might serve to restrict LTM formation to ecologically relevant situations . Although the requirement of NMDA receptor in PAM-α1 implies that MBON-α1 provides excitatory input , the synaptic connectivity between MBON-α1 and PAM-α1 awaits physiological demonstration , given functional inhibitory glutamate receptor signaling ( Liu and Wilson , 2013 ) . In addition to the role in memory acquisition , the PAM-α1 output is required during consolidation ( Figure 9A , B ) . The dopamine release is likely to be sustained by the ongoing activity of the recurrent circuit ( Figure 9C–F ) . A recent study reported a consistent finding that the output from α/β KCs during consolidation has an essential role for appetitive and aversive LTM ( Huang et al . , 2012 ) in addition to their role in retrieval ( Krashes et al . , 2007; Trannoy et al . , 2011; Cervantes-Sandoval et al . , 2013; Xie et al . , 2013 ) . Recent studies revealed a gradual development of appetitive LTM after conditioning ( Das et al . , 2014; Huetteroth et al . , 2015; Yamagata et al . , 2015 ) . Ongoing activity in the recurrent loop we propose here may provide a circuit mechanism for the gradual LTM development . In addition , previous studies reported that LTM consolidation in Drosophila ( Placais et al . , 2012; Musso et al . , 2015 ) or in rats ( Rossato et al . , 2009 ) requires post-training dopamine inputs . Our generalization experiments show that appetitive LTM is less specific to the trained odor , compared to STM ( Figure 10 ) . This result fits well into previous studies in mice and bees , demonstrating that long-lasting memories are more generalized ( Stach and Giurfa , 2005; Wiltgen and Silva , 2007 ) . More generalizable LTM makes sense from an ecological viewpoint: it is worth taking a chance for survival even if the smell is not exactly the same as learned . In the fly brain , distinct types of dopamine neurons signal reward for STM and LTM , and these memories are independently formed in different MB lobes ( Trannoy et al . , 2011; Huetteroth et al . , 2015; Yamagata et al . , 2015 ) . Octopamine has been widely accepted as a positive reinforcement signal in insects ( Hammer , 1993; Hammer and Menzel , 1998; Schwaerzel et al . , 2003; Schroll et al . , 2006; Perry and Barron , 2013 ) . In Drosophila , it is considered to provide inputs to dopamine neurons that induce STM formation ( Burke et al . , 2012; Das et al . , 2014; Huetteroth et al . , 2015 ) . Recent studies in mammals reached a similar conclusion that memories with different temporal dynamics are mutually conflicting and formed in distinct areas , to which different classes of dopamine neurons project ( Liljenstrom , 2003; Abraham and Robins , 2005; Kim and Hikosaka , 2013; Kim et al . , 2014 ) . Independent processing of STM and LTM might be a conserved strategy among animals . In addition to the function in the recurrent reward circuit , MBON-α1 mediates retrieval of the LTM trace in the MB ( Figure 8 ) . MBON-α1 samples from the MB-α1 and terminates in the SIP and the SLP . Another type of MBONs also mediates appetitive LTM retrieval: MBON-α3 ( also known as MB-V3 ) ( Placais et al . , 2013 ) . In contrast to MBON-α1 , blocking MBON-α3 during conditioning does not impair appetitive LTM acquisition ( Placais et al . , 2013 ) . MBON-α3 arborizes dendrites in the tip of the α lobe and projects to the SMP and the SIP where the terminals of MBON-α1 and MBON-α3 are intermingled ( Aso et al . , 2014a ) . Therefore , appetitive LTM formed in the α/β KCs is read out through at least two different classes of MBONs . These MBONs converge in the SIP ( Aso et al . , 2014a ) and might activate shared downstream targets to guide conditioned odor approach . The recent comprehensive connectivity map of the afferent and efferent neurons of the Drosophila MB revealed many potential feedback connections outside the MB ( Aso et al . , 2014a ) . Considering the central role of the MB in sensory integration and memory-guided behavior ( Aso et al . , 2014b ) , recurrent computation between learned information and reinforcement signals might be a fundamental principle of memory processing . In both vertebrates and invertebrates , the activity of reinforcement neurons is modified upon associative learning ( Hammer , 1993; Mirenowicz and Schultz , 1994; Riemensperger et al . , 2005; Cohen et al . , 2012; Schultz , 2013 ) . Our results delineated such a feedback circuit , which was predicted by a physiological study in Drosophila ( Riemensperger et al . , 2005 ) . In this circuit , MBON-α1 mediates monosynaptic feedback to the dopamine neurons . In contrast , there is no monosynaptic feedback to the dopamine neurons found in mammals , rather anatomical studies suggest such a feedback to be polysynaptic ( Lisman and Grace , 2005; Watabe-Uchida et al . , 2012 ) . Further comparative studies should assess how the recurrent circuit motif of reinforcement is implemented in different animal brains . 4 Materials and methods Canton-S was used as a wild-type strain .

The following antibodies were used: rabbit-anti-GFP ( 1:1000; A11122; Invitrogen ) , mouse-anti-GFP ( 1:200; UC Davis/NIH Neuromab Facility; clone N86/38; for GRASP ) , mouse anti-nc82 ( 1:33 . 3; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank , Univ . Iowa , Iowa City , IA , United States ) ( Hofbauer et al . , 2009 ) , rat-anti-nCad ( 1:200; DN-Ex #8; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank , University of Iowa ) , rabbit anti-HA ( 1:300; Cell Signaling Technology , MA , United States ) , rat anti-FLAG ( 1:200; Novus Biologicals , Littleton , CO , United States ) , mouse anti-Drosophila ChAT ( ChAT4B1; 1: 100; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank , Univ . Iowa ) ( Takagawa and Salvaterra , 1996 ) , rabbit anti-Drosophila GAD1 ( 1:1000; a gift from Dr FR Jackson ) ( Featherstone et al . , 2000 ) , rabbit anti-DvGluT ( 1:5000; a gift from Dr A DiAntonio ) ( Daniels et al . , 2008 ) as primary antibodies , and cross-adsorbed secondary antibodies to IgG ( H+L ) : AlexaFluor-488 donkey anti-mouse ( 1:400; Jackson Labs ) , Cy3 donkey anti-rabbit ( 1:500; Jackson Labs ) , AlexaFluor-647 donkey anti-rat ( 1:300; Jackson Labs ) , AlexaFluor-488 goat anti-rabbit ( 1:800; A11034; Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , United States ) , and AlexaFluor-568 goat anti-mouse ( 1:400; A11031; Invitrogen ) . Confocal images were obtained by using LSM710 ( Zeiss , Oberkochen , Germany ) ( Figures 1A–F , 2A , E , 3B , F , Figure 1—figure supplement 1 , Figure 2—figure supplement 1 , Figure 3—figure supplement 1 , Figure 6—figure supplement 1 ) and FV1200 ( Olympus , Tokyo , Japan ) ( Figure 2F ) and processed by using ImageJ . The magnified images in SIP and SLP ( Figure 2B–D ) were obtained by using LSM880 ( Zeiss ) with Airyscan and were deconvoluted using the Fiji plugin provided by Bob Dougherty ( http://fiji . sc/Deconvolution ) . Airyscan is equipped with 32 GaAsP detectors that collect light from one illumination spot . It can resolve 140 nm ( lateral ) or 400 nm ( axial ) at 488-nm wavelength . For the 3D rendering video , confocal images from LSM710 were deconvoluted using the Fiji plugin and then were subjected to 3D image rendering software ( Volocity: from PerkinElmer , Waltham , MA , United States ) . The conditioning and testing protocol was as described previously with minor modifications ( Liu et al . , 2012; Aso et al . , 2014b; Yamagata et al . , 2015 ) . Briefly , a group of approximately 50 flies in a training tube alternately received octan-3-ol ( 3-OCT; Merck ) and 4-methylcyclohexanol ( 4-MCH; Sigma–Aldrich , St . Louis , MO , United States ) for 1 min in a constant air stream with or without dried sucrose paper . 3-OCT and 4-MCH were diluted 1% and 2% , respectively , in paraffin oil ( Sigma–Aldrich ) , placed in a cup with a diameter of 14 mm and presented to flies . For thermoactivation experiments ( Figure 5 ) , 3-OCT and 4-MCH were diluted 10% in paraffin oil , placed in a cup with a diameter of 3 mm and 5 , respectively , and presented to flies . For the generalization experiments ( Figure 10 ) , 1% 1-octen-3-ol ( Sigma–Aldrich ) and 2% 2-methylcyclohexanol ( Sigma–Aldrich ) were also utilized . These diluted odors were mixed with the respective ratios . The restrictive temperature for the experiments with UAS-shits1 was 32°C and the permissive temperature was 24°C , measured with Venta-Hygrometer ( Venta Luftwäscher GmbH , Weingarten , Germany ) . At the test , the trained flies were allowed to choose between MCH and OCT for 2 min in a custom-made transparent Plexiglas T-maze , illuminated by infrared LEDs ( Osram 720-SFH487P , Mouser electronics , Mansfield , TX , United States ) , and the walls were covered with Fluon ( Insect-a-Slip , PTFE30 , BioQuip Products , Inc . , Rancho Dominguez , CA , United States ) and the distribution of flies was imaged by cameras ( FFMV-03M2M , Point Grey , Richmond , Canada ) . Captured images were sent to the computer and the fly number in each tube was counted by a custom-made ImageJ macro . The preference index was calculated by taking the mean indices of the last 60 s in the 2-min choice and the learning index was calculated by taking the mean of preference indices of the two reciprocally trained groups . Half of the trained groups received reinforcement together with the first presented odor and the other half with the second odor to cancel the effect of the order of reinforcement . For thermoactivation with dTrpA1 ( Figure 5 ) , flies were trained by being transferred from a background temperature of 24°C to a prewarmed tube in a climate box ( 30°C ) and presented with the training odorant for 1 min . Flies were aged 3–10 days after eclosion and were starved so that the mortality rate reaches 5–15% at the test . Between the training and the test , flies were kept without food . Conditioning was performed in dim red light and testing was in darkness . Statistical analyses were performed with StatPlus and Prism5 ( GraphPad , La Jolla , CA , United States ) . Data did not violate the assumption of normal distribution ( Shapiro–Wilk test ) and homogeneity of variance ( Bartlett test ) . Therefore , the data were analyzed with parametric statistics: one-sample t-test or one-way analysis of variance followed by the planned pairwise multiple comparisons ( Bonferroni ) . The significance level of statistical tests was set to 0 . 05 ."}

Although reactivation from latency can cause life-threatening disease , our molecular understanding of HCMV latency is incomplete . Here we use single cell RNA-seq analysis to characterize latency in monocytes and hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells ( HSPCs ) . In monocytes , we identify host cell surface markers that enable enrichment of latent cells harboring higher viral transcript levels , which can reactivate more efficiently , and are characterized by reduced intrinsic immune response that is important for viral gene expression . Significantly , in latent HSPCs , viral transcripts could be detected only in monocyte progenitors and were also associated with reduced immune-response . Overall , our work indicates that regardless of the developmental stage in which HCMV infects , HCMV drives hematopoietic cells towards a weaker immune-responsive monocyte state and that this anergic-like state is crucial for the virus ability to express its transcripts and to eventually reactivate .", "plain language summary": "Most people around the world unknowingly carry the human cytomegalovirus , as this virus can become dormant after infection and hide in small numbers of blood stem cells ( which give rise to blood and immune cells ) . Dormant viruses still make their host cells read their genetic information and create viral proteins – a process known as gene expression – but they do not use them to quickly multiply . However , it is possible for the cytomegalovirus to reawaken at a later stage and start replicating again , which can be fatal for people with weakened immune systems . It is therefore important to understand exactly how the virus can stay dormant , and how it reactivates . Only certain infected cells allow dormant viruses to later reactivate; in others , it never starts to multiply again . Techniques that can monitor individual cells are therefore needed to understand how the host cells and the viruses interact during dormant infection and reactivation . To investigate this , Shnayder et al . infected blood stem cells in the laboratory and used a method known as single-cell RNA analysis , which highlights all the genes ( including viral genes ) that are expressed in a cell . This showed that in certain cells , the virus dampens the cell defenses , leading to a higher rate of viral gene expression and , in turn , easier reactivation . Further experiments showed that the blood stem cells that expressed the viral genes were marked to become a type of immune cells known as monocytes . In turn , these infected monocytes were shown to be less able to defend the body against infection , suggesting that latent human cytomegalovirus suppresses the body’s innate immune response . The reactivation of human cytomegalovirus is a dangerous issue for patients who have just received an organ or blood stem cells transplant . The study by Shnayder et al . indicates that treatments that boost innate immunity may help to prevent the virus from reawakening , but more work is needed to test this theory .", "article": "1 Introduction Human cytomegalovirus ( HCMV ) is a prevalent pathogen of the beta-herpesvirus family , infecting the majority of the human population worldwide ( Staras et al . , 2006 ) . Following primary infection , HCMV persists through the lifetime of the host by establishing latency . In the latent state , no viral progeny is produced but the virus maintains the capacity to reactivate . Reactivation in immunocompromised individuals , such as transplant recipients and HIV patients , leads to severe illness and mortality ( Crough and Khanna , 2009 ) . Despite the significant health burden that accompanies HCMV reactivation from latency , to date there is no treatment that targets the latent stage and the processes governing latency and reactivation are far from fully understood . HCMV has a wide cell tropism within its human host ( Mocarski and Shenk , 2013 ) , with most cell types supporting lytic replication ( Sinzger et al . , 2008a ) . In contrast , latent infection has so far been characterized in cells of the early myeloid lineage , including CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells ( HSPCs ) and CD14+ monocytes in vivo ( Mendelson et al . , 1996; Taylor-Wiedeman et al . , 1991; von Laer et al . , 1995 ) . Since CD14+ monocytes are short-lived cells it has been proposed that the latent reservoir resides in hematopoietic stem cells ( HSCs ) ( Slobedman et al . , 2010 ) and that latent monocytes support viral spread and persistence within the infected host ( Stevenson et al . , 2014 ) . Latent cells in HCMV seropositive individuals are scarce and were estimated by PCR-driven in situ hybridization , at 1:10 , 000 to 25 , 000 with a copy number of 2 to 13 genomes per infected cell ( Slobedman and Mocarski , 1999 ) . Using highly sensitive methodologies , such as digital PCR , viral genomes were detected in less than half of seropositive individuals and viral load was estimated at less than 10 genomes in 10 , 000 cells in most individuals ( Jackson et al . , 2017; Parry et al . , 2016 ) . Due to the scarcity of HCMV-infected cells in the natural context , in vitro HCMV infection of primary cells , mainly HSPCs and monocytes were developed as models . The caveat of these systems is their heterogeneity and the possibility that they may represent dynamic differentiation states . Additionally , although both models are being widely used , the differences between them are not well understood . It is becoming increasingly evident that the repertoire of viral genes expressed during latent infections is broader than initially appreciated ( Cheng et al . , 2017; Schwartz and Stern-Ginossar , 2019; Shnayder et al . , 2018 ) . Despite low expression of viral transcripts , a number of studies have described infection driven changes in host cells during HCMV latency ( Chan et al . , 2010; Kew et al . , 2017; Reeves et al . , 2012; Slobedman et al . , 2002; Smith et al . , 2007; Smith et al . , 2004 ) . Monocyte infection was proposed to promote differentiation to macrophages with specific polarization towards genes that mark M1 phenotype with some atypical attributes ( Chan et al . , 2008; Smith et al . , 2004 ) . On the other hand it was shown that the viral homolog of human interleukin-10 , encoded by UL111A , polarizes monocytes into an anti-inflammatory M2 subset ( Avdic et al . , 2013 ) . The UL7 viral protein was found to bind Fms-like tyrosine kinase three receptor ( Flt-3R ) , inducing differentiation of HSPCs to monocytes and of monocytes to macrophages ( Crawford et al . , 2018 ) . Finally , analysis of HCMV- infected HSPCs revealed reprogramming of HSPCs into immune-suppressive monocytes ( Zhu et al . , 2018 ) . Thus , although it is clear that latent HCMV infection affects the differentiation state of infected HSPCs and monocytes , the nature of these effects is still enigmatic and controversial . The studies to date examining host responses to latent HCMV infection focused on differences between infected and uninfected cells or on the effect of specific viral transcripts . Since the experimental systems for HCMV latency rely on primary immune cell populations , which are heterogeneous , and since infection is variable within the culture , it is likely that analyses of bulk populations could miss important signatures . Single cell-RNA-seq ( scRNA-seq ) provides a unique opportunity to depict viral and host heterogeneity simultaneously and thus to uncover functional connections between the cellular environment and viral gene expression . Indeed , several recent works that applied single cell transcriptomics , revealed novel insights into the complexity of the host response and cellular permissiveness for a number of well-studied viruses ( Douam et al . , 2017; Drayman et al . , 2019; Galinato et al . , 2018; Rato et al . , 2017; Russell et al . , 2018; Steuerman et al . , 2018; Wyler et al . , 2019; Zanini et al . , 2018 ) . Using single cell RNA data , we analyzed host determinants that are associated with HCMV latency . In CD14+ monocytes , we identified two cellular cell surface markers , MHCII and its chaperon CD74 , whose expression is inversely-correlated with viral transcript levels . We demonstrate these markers allow separating between cells harboring higher and lower viral transcript levels , that these differences are induced by HCMV infection and that the cells exhibiting higher viral transcript levels support more efficient reactivation of HCMV from latency . Using these markers , we show that latently infected cells display an intrinsic weaker immune response state that is important for the viral ability to express its genes and reactivate . Furthermore , analysis of 7500 infected HSPCs revealed very heterogeneous populations , but viral transcripts were only detected in cells expressing monocyte lineage markers , such as CD14 . Remarkably , also in these HSPC-derived monocytes , higher viral transcript levels were associated with lower expression of CD74 and reduced immune response gene signature . Taken together , our findings highlight cell surface proteins associated with viral transcript levels and establish that both HSPC and monocyte infection models lead to establishment of HCMV latency in a similar anergic-like state of monocytic cells . 2 Results We have previously performed single cell RNA sequencing ( scRNA-seq ) on HCMV- infected CD14+ monocytes as a model for studying HCMV latency ( Shnayder et al . , 2018 ) . We used the Massively Parallel RNA Sequencing ( MARS-seq ) platform ( Jaitin et al . , 2014; Paul et al . , 2015 ) to analyze experimentally infected primary CD14+ monocytes at different days post infection ( dpi ) . This approach provided high coverage of cellular and viral transcriptomes , spanning expression of more than 11 , 000 genes in 3 , 655 cells . We previously used this dataset to examine the viral transcriptome during HCMV latency , showing it largely mirrors a late lytic viral program , albeit at much lower levels of expression ( Shnayder et al . , 2018 ) . An inherent advantage of scRNA-seq is the ability to track viral and host expression within the same cell , thus allowing analysis of viral-host interactions while keeping information on cell-to-cell and infection heterogeneity . Viral transcript levels in the majority of the infected monocyte population was low to undetectable and projection of the cells using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding ( t-SNE ) demonstrated that the cell distribution is determined mainly according to host gene expression variations ( Shnayder et al . , 2018 ) . Nevertheless , the cells are organized according to viral transcript levels ( Shnayder et al . , 2018 ) and Figure 1A ) , suggesting that much of the differences in host gene expression are associated with variation in viral transcript levels . We therefore calculated Spearman correlation coefficient between the expression of each host gene and the total number of viral transcripts across all cells ( Figure 1B ) . 319 cellular genes showed significant positive or negative correlations with viral gene expression ( Z score >2 , Figure 1—source data 1 ) . Since a key challenge in transcriptome analysis is to connect between snapshots of gene expression profiles and a functional outcome , we first focused on identifying cell surface markers that exhibited strong association with viral gene expression in the scRNA-seq data as these may allow us to enrich for cells with higher viral transcript levels within the population . Among the strongest co-varying genes were genes encoding for MHC class II ( variants HLA-DRB1/HLA-DPB1/HLA-DRA/HLA-DQB1/HLA-DPA1/HLA-DQA1/HLA-DMA/HLA-DRB5/HLA-DQA2 and HLA-DMB ) and the transcript of CD74 , an MHCII chaperon as well as a cell surface receptor on its own ( Bergmann , 2012 ) . Indeed , across the infected monocyte population , the expression level of MHC class II ( MHCII , Figure 1C ) and CD74 ( Figure 1D ) showed clear inverse-correlation to viral transcript levels ( Figure 1A ) . Viral gene expression levels in latent infection decreases with time in culture , likely due to continuous repression of the viral genome . This time related reduction in viral transcript levels is also apparent in our CD14+ monocytes scRNA-seq data ( Figure 1E ) , thus the increase in CD74 and MHCII expression could be related to time in culture and to only indirectly inversely-correlate with viral transcript levels ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . Indeed , we observed that the expression of both CD74 and MHCII increase over time in culture , both in infected and in uninfected cells ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ) . We therefore tested whether this inverse-correlation between CD74 and MHCII expression and viral transcript levels is upheld within a single infected population at single time points . To this end , we infected primary CD14+ monocytes with HCMV strain TB40/E-GFP ( O'Connor and Murphy , 2012; Sinzger et al . , 2008a ) . At 3 days post infection ( dpi ) the cells were FACS-sorted according to the cell-surface levels of CD74 and MHCII ( Figure 2A and Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) . RT-qPCR analysis of viral gene expression in these populations confirmed that both CD74low and MHCIIlow monocyte populations express higher levels of viral transcripts compared to their high expressing counterparts ( Figure 2B and Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) . Importantly , the association of higher viral transcript levels with lower cell-surface levels of CD74 was also maintained at 6dpi ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2 ) . We next examined if MHCII and CD74 are independent markers or are co-expressed and therefore mark the same population . mRNA expression analysis of CD74 and MHCII cells sorted according to the cell-surface levels of CD74 and MHCII as well as analysis of their co-expression in the scRNA-seq data , confirmed that the two markers are co-expressed and probably can be used to sort similar subpopulations within the infected cell population ( Figure 2C and Figure 2—figure supplement 3 ) . We therefore conducted all further experiments using CD74 based sorts . qPCR Analysis of viral DNA levels demonstrated that higher viral transcript levels in CD74low monocytes are concurrent with higher abundance of viral genomes ( Figure 2D ) suggesting that differential loads of viral genome templates probably contribute to differential viral transcript levels and therefore to the effect on the host . Finally , we examined CD74 cell surface expression in infected and uninfected cells at different time points post infection but no major changes in CD74 distribution following infection were observed ( Figure 2—figure supplement 4 ) . There are two alternative explanations for the inverse-correlation between viral transcript levels and CD74 cell-surface levels , several days post infection with HCMV . The first possibility is that viral entry is more efficient in CD74low monocytes compared to CD74high monocytes , leading to more incoming viral genomes and higher viral transcript levels . In this case , differences in viral levels between CD74high and CD74low monocytes should be evident immediately following viral entry to the cells . An alternative option is that the differential expression of CD74 is driven by HCMV infection . In this case , the viral DNA and RNA levels in early stages of infection should be independent of CD74 cell-surface levels , and at later time points , higher load of virus leads to the observed differences in CD74 expression . To test these possibilities , uninfected freshly isolated CD14+ monocytes were FACS sorted based on CD74 cell-surface levels and then infected separately with TB40E-GFP . At 8 and 72 hr post infection ( hpi ) viral DNA and RNA were analyzed by qPCR . We confirmed that indeed the CD74high and CD74low sorted cells exhibited differences in CD74 transcript levels negating the possibility that the separation is only due to variations associated with the cell surface staining ( Figure 3A ) . No significant differences between viral DNA load ( Figure 3B ) or viral transcript levels ( Figure 3C ) in CD74high and CD74low monocytes were observed at either 8 or 72hpi , indicating there are no major differences in the efficiency of viral entry between the two populations . Taken together , these results indicate that the observed variation in CD74 cell-surface levels is induced following HCMV infection . An important characteristic that defines latent infection is the ability of the virus to reactivate . Therefore , a key challenge in gene expression analysis is to connect between snapshots of gene expression profiles and the infection status of the cells , which is defined by this functional outcome . The identification of cellular cell surface markers that inversely-correlate with viral transcript levels provides a handle to connect between gene expression and the ability of the virus to reactivate . To test the association between viral transcript levels and reactivation efficiency , HCMV- infected primary CD14+ monocytes were sorted by CD74 cell-surface levels , and viral reactivation was induced by two complementary methods; cytokine driven differentiation to dendritic cells ( DCs ) ( Reeves et al . , 2005 ) , followed by incubation with an indicator fibroblasts monolayer , or long term co-culturing with fibroblasts . Quantification of GFP positive plaques showed that reactivation was significantly more frequent in CD74low cells compared to CD74high cells , in both protocols ( Figure 4A and B ) . Lysed samples of monocytes plated onto indicator fibroblasts produced no plaques , confirming that these infected cells did not produce any detectable infectious virus , consistent with latency prior to reactivation induction . These results demonstrate a functional difference in reactivation efficiency associated with cell-surface CD74 levels as well as with viral transcript levels and genome load . Based on our experimental infection results , we next tested whether CD74 expression on CD14+ monocytes could be used as a cell surface marker that will allow enrichment of cells that contain HCMV genomes in healthy seropositive individuals . We used digital droplet PCR ( ddPCR ) to detect viral genome loads in CD14+ monocytes from seven seropositive donors . Despite using a highly sensitive platform ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) and detection of several positive events , testing 100 , 000–400 , 000 cells per donor did not provide us with levels of detection and reproducibility that allowed relative quantification ( Figure 5—figure supplement 2A and B and Supplementary file 1 ) . Recently , it was suggested that latent HCMV resides in a unique B7H4-positive monocyte subset ( Zhu et al . , 2018 ) . To examine whether we can enrich for a cell population in which we can detect robust levels of HCMV genomes , we collected CD14+ monocytes from 5 healthy seropositive individuals . In all five donors we could not detect a distinct population of B7H4-positive cells ( Figure 5—figure supplement 2C ) . We nevertheless sorted the top 2% and the bottom 70% B7H4 stained cells and measured HCMV genome loads by ddPCR but did not detect higher levels of HCMV genomes in the top 2% B7H4 cells ( Figure 5—figure supplement 2D ) . We therefore next analyzed CD14+ monocytes from seven hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT ) recipient samples in which HCMV viremia was detected , for the presence of viral genomes . In three of the tested samples no virus could be detected in CD14+ monocytes ( Figure 5—figure supplement 2E ) . Monocytes from the four additional samples , in which viral genomes were detected ( Figure 5—figure supplement 2E ) , were sorted according to CD74 cell-surface levels ( Figure 5A ) . In agreement with our results in the experimental infection model , CD74 low monocytes were significantly enriched for the virus compared to CD74high monocytes , illustrating that also in this natural infection setting , CD74 expression can be used to enrich for monocytes carrying viral genomes ( Figure 5B and C ) . To further characterize the differences in host pathways associated with the variations in viral transcript levels we conducted RNA-seq on latently infected monocytes , sorted according to their CD74 cell-surface levels . As was seen for single viral genes ( Figure 2B ) , we found that on a genome-wide level , viral gene expression is higher in CD74low cells compared to CD74high cells ( Figure 6A and Figure 6—figure supplement 1A ) . Furthermore , in accordance with our previous findings ( Shnayder et al . , 2018 ) the viral gene expression profile in these cells was correlated with late lytic profile ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1B ) , but viral transcript levels were very low ( ~0 . 1% of mRNA reads originated from the virus ) . We performed differential gene expression analysis comparing between the CD74low and CD74high populations . This analysis revealed 113 differentially expressed cellular genes ( FDR < 0 . 05 , Figure 6—source data 1 ) . Gene set enrichment analysis ( GSEA ) show that compared to CD74low , CD74high monocytes , which exhibit lower viral transcript levels , are enriched for many immune response related pathways ( Figure 6B and Figure 6—source data 2 ) including adaptive immune response and response to interferon gamma ( Figure 6C ) . Since these cells were extracted from the same culture , these results suggest that monocytes carrying higher viral load are driven towards an intrinsic anergic-like phenotype . Reassuringly , many of the cellular genes and pathways exhibiting higher expression in CD74high cells were also inversely-correlated with viral transcript levels in the scRNA-seq data ( Figure 6D , Figure 6—figure supplement 2 and Supplementary file 2 ) . The CD74low monocyte population , which exhibits higher viral transcript levels , was enriched in genes that are related to transcription and virus life cycle ( Figure 6B and Figure 6—source data 2 ) . These pathways were not significantly correlated with viral expression levels in the single cell dataset , perhaps due to the sparser nature of our single cell measurements , which due to the sampling of limited number of cells may not detect some weaker effects . To decipher the differentiation status of latent monocytes we compared our data to a recently published single cell analysis of lineage commitment during hematopoiesis ( Velten et al . , 2017 ) . The genes that showed elevated expression in the CD74high cell population compared to the CD74low population were enriched for genes associated with monocyte lineage priming ( Figure 6E ) , implying that the cells exhibiting higher viral transcript levels express less commitment markers and therefore may represent a less differentiated state . Significantly , this gene signature of monocyte lineage priming was also inversely-correlated with viral transcript levels in the scRNA-seq data ( Figure 6F ) . To further investigate the cell differentiation state , we analyzed gene sets that were previously associated with M1 or M2 polarization ( Gerrick et al . , 2018 ) and found that genes that were more highly expressed in CD74high monocytes were significantly enriched for genes previously associated with M2 phenotype ( Pval = 2 . 25×10−8 ) . This suggests that the infected CD14+ monocytes in our culture conditions may be polarized towards a cell-state associated with M2 phenotype , however higher viral transcript levels attenuates this differentiation trajectory . Since a main feature of CD74low monocytes is intrinsic reduced responsiveness to immune signals , we reasoned that this feature could contribute to the higher ability of the virus to express viral transcripts and eventually reactivate . To test this we examined whether inhibition of interferon signaling affects the expression level of viral transcripts and its ability to reactivate in infected CD14+ monocytes . We used ruxolitinib , a potent and selective Janus kinase ( JAK ) 1 and 2 inhibitor ( Lin et al . , 2009 ) that blocks the signaling downstream of interferon receptors . Treatment with ruxolitinib immediately after infection ( 3hpi ) resulted in a considerable reduction in the levels of interferon-induced genes at 3 and 6dpi ( Figure 7A ) and in increased expression of essentially all viral transcripts ( Figure 7B ) , in an overall uniform manner ( Figure 7—figure supplement 1 ) . In order to test how long after infection blocking interferon signaling still affects viral transcript levels , we applied ruxolitinib at different time points along infection and measured viral transcripts by RNA-seq . Interestingly , although the effect was smaller when the inhibitor was added later along infection , blocking interferon signaling still increased viral transcript levels even when added 3dpi ( Figure 7C ) . These results therefore indicate there is continuous expression of viral genes and at 3dpi viral genes are still transcribed . However , the reduced effect of ruxolitinib with time also points that in addition there is gradual repression of viral gene expression as was also captured in our scRNA-seq analysis ( Shnayder et al . , 2018 and Figure 1E ) . Importantly , blocking interferon signaling led to more efficient reactivation of the virus ( Figure 7D ) . This demonstrates that interferon signaling has a major role in repression of viral gene expression in infected monocytes and that the anergic-like state of monocytes exhibiting higher viral transcript levels is likely important for latency maintenance and reactivation . We have previously also performed scRNA-seq analysis of HCMV- infected CD34+ HSPCs at 4dpi ( Shnayder et al . , 2018 ) . To gain insight into the effects of HCMV on HSPC differentiation , we inferred differentiation trajectories using Monocle , a strategy that allows placing single cells along a pseudotime continuum based on their gene expression ( Trapnell et al . , 2014; Figure 8A ) . The cells expressing HCMV transcripts were clustered in a region that exhibited the latest pseudotime ( i . e the most differentiated state , Figure 8B ) . Remarkably , although we infected bone marrow derived CD34+ HSPCs , viral transcripts were expressed only in cells expressing monocyte lineage markers ( Velten et al . , 2017 ) , such as IRF7 , IRF8 ( Figure 8C ) and CD14 ( Figure 8D ) . Taking into account that it was previously shown that HCMV infects multipotent hematopoietic stem cells ( Goodrum et al . , 2004 ) , these results indicate that HCMV induces differentiation of infected HSPCs towards the monocyte lineage . Interestingly , more detailed analysis of the distinct group of cells that expressed monocyte markers , revealed that this group could be split into two close yet distinct clusters , with viral reads being detected in much more cells in one of the clusters . Interestingly , the cluster showing higher viral transcript levels exhibited lower expression of CD74 ( Pval = 1 . 73×10−95 , Figure 8E and F ) as well as gene signatures associated with lower immune response to interferon gamma and lower adaptive immune response ( Pval <0 . 001 and Pval = 0 . 003 , respectively , Figure 8G and H ) . Thus , cells within the HSPC population that exhibit the highest viral gene expression belong to the CD14+ monocyte cell lineage and are associated with similar anergic-like signatures as infected monocytes . 3 Discussion HCMV establishes latency in its host in progenitor cells of the myeloid system ( Mendelson et al . , 1996; Taylor-Wiedeman et al . , 1991; von Laer et al . , 1995 ) . Nevertheless , in cell culture experimental systems it is apparent that not all cells have the ability to reactivate , indicating that there are variations in the levels or dynamics of latent infection . This heterogeneity means that bulk assays , comparing infected and uninfected cell populations can capture host responses to HCMV infection but likely miss specific responses in the group of cells in which latency is established , and will enable reactivation down the line . Recent single cell RNA-seq data portray low-level expression of a broad spectrum of canonical viral lytic genes during HCMV latent infection of various cells of the hematopoietic system ( Galinato et al . , 2018; Shnayder et al . , 2018 ) . Our analysis of latent HCMV- infected CD14+ monocytes revealed a continuous population . Essentially , all of the cells were infected; however , they varied in the levels of viral transcripts . We exploited the host and viral heterogeneity , revealed simultaneously in scRNA-seq data , to look for associations between viral transcript levels and the human transcriptome . We found that among the genes that were highly inversely-correlated with viral transcript levels , is a group of genes encoding MHCII as well as the cell surface marker CD74 , which serves as an MHCII chaperone . The finding that there are host genes that show specific correlation with viral transcript levels indicates that there is direct interaction between the host and the virus during latent infection- either there is a preference of the virus to infect specific cell types or that the virus actively affects the host transcriptome . Indeed , these markers could be used to enrich for cells with increased viral genome load and viral transcript levels . Importantly , this was supported by analysis of CD14+ monocytes from viremic patients , which also shows a clear inverse-correlation between CD74 cell-surface levels and viral genome load . These results are in line with previous findings showing that human , murine and rat cytomegalovirus down regulate the surface expression of MHCII molecules in cells of the myeloid lineage ( Baca Jones et al . , 2009; Elder et al . , 2019; Lee et al . , 2011; Slobedman et al . , 2002; Yunis et al . , 2018 ) . In addition , CIITA , a transcription factor that regulates CD74 and MHCII , was shown to be down regulated by HCMV ( Lee et al . , 2011 ) . The inverse-association between the expression of CD74 and MHCII and viral transcript levels could be related to differences in permissivity for the virus . By cell sorting according to CD74 levels prior to infection , we show that this is likely not the case; instead , these changes seem to be induced by viral infection . Moreover , we see that higher viral transcript levels in CD74low cells is also accompanied by higher abundance of viral genomes , indicating that the level of viral transcripts is determined , at least initially , by the amount of incoming genomes , and this contributes to the extent of the effect on the host . Importantly , reactivation from HCMV latency happens in a very small population of cells even in experimental systems where the majority of cells are infected . We show here that CD74low monocytes , which carry higher viral transcript and viral genome levels , reactivate more efficiently . This indicates that the ability of monocytes to reactivate is associated with viral transcript expression and that the cells carrying higher viral loads in these models are functionally the latent cell population , as they are more likely to reactivate . Recently , B7H4 was suggested as a marker for monocytes with higher levels of HCMV genomes from HCMV seropositive individuals ( Zhu et al . , 2018 ) , however , we could not detect expression of B7H4 mRNA in any of our RNA-seq samples . Moreover , by staining for B7H4 , we could not identify a distinct B7H4 positive monocyte population and did not detect higher levels of HCMV genomes in the top 2% B7H4 sorted cells . According to available human datasets , B7H4 is indeed not expressed in healthy monocytes ( Blood Atlas , 2019 ) , however , these differences may stem from sampling of different donors or due to other variables related to the isolation of the cells . Our analysis indicates that the cells that have higher expression of viral genes are less immune-responsive including reduced response to interferons . Since the CD74high and CD74low monocytes we analyzed grew in the same culture , they were exposed to the same immune-extrinsic signals . Hence , this difference is intrinsic to specific cells , and may be actively induced by the virus . This is supported by a recent report showing that interferon induced genes are downregulated during latent infection of CD14+ monocytes ( Elder et al . , 2019 ) . This anergic-like state is functionally related to the ability of the virus to express viral transcripts and to reactivate , as inhibiting the response to interferons resulted in increased expression of viral transcripts as well as increased reactivation efficiency . The importance of the role interferon plays in latent infection is further supported by the fact that CMV replication can be inhibited in otherwise permissive cells by treatment with interferon beta ( Dağ et al . , 2014 ) . Similarly , extrinsic interferon stimuli inhibited HSV-1 reactivation from latency in neuronal cells ( Linderman et al . , 2017 ) . Importantly , blocking interferon signaling increases viral gene expression even when done up to 3dpi , suggesting that there is continuous viral gene expression . However , the effect was smaller when the inhibitor was added later along infection , indicating a gradual repression of viral gene expression with time . Overall , these findings indicate that a major aspect of the maintenance of latency and of the ability to reactivate at the cellular level is a balance between opposing forces which also affect each other- the intrinsic immune response , specifically the interferon pathway , and viral transcript levels . Future work will have to delineate the mechanisms by which these immune response pathways control general viral transcription and how viral transcripts and viral proteins modulate the immune response during latent infection . Previous works have described changes in the differentiation state of monocytes in response to infection or to specific viral genes ( Avdic et al . , 2013; Chan et al . , 2008; Smith et al . , 2004 ) . The use of the CD74 marker , allowed us to focus on differentiation processes unique to the CD14+ monocytes with higher viral transcript levels and higher reactivation efficiencies . We show that higher viral transcript levels are associated with less expression of monocyte priming signature and lower expression of a gene signature associated with M2 phenotype . It was previously shown that the HCMV encoded IL-10 homolog polarizes monocytes towards an M2c macrophage phenotype ( Avdic et al . , 2013 ) . It is possible that the total population is indeed polarized towards this direction; however , this process may be inhibited in cells with higher viral transcript levels . These findings may suggest that the virus promotes attenuation of differentiation processes that monocytes are undergoing in culture and in the blood ( Patel et al . , 2017 ) . Examining the differentiation state in HSPCs following infection is far more complicated than in monocytes , as CD34+ HSPCs are a mix of pluripotent cells as well as progenitor cells in different stages of lineage commitment ( Velten et al . , 2017 ) . By applying single cell trajectory analysis , which allows recovery of gene expression kinetics of differentiating cells ( Trapnell et al . , 2014 ) , and aligning our data with data of lineage commitment during hematopoiesis ( Velten et al . , 2017 ) , we show that cells containing detectable viral transcripts belong largely to one specific population- cells primed towards the monocyte lineage . From our data , we cannot determine whether this is due to preferential infection by HCMV of monocyte lineage committed cells within the HSPC compartment or whether HCMV infects multipotent cells , which are then either preferentially skewed towards the monocytic lineage or viral gene expression is initiated only when cells start to differentiate in the monocytes lineage . However since it was previously demonstrated that multipotent cells are infected with HCMV ( Goodrum et al . , 2004 ) , the latter options are more likely . Previous studies demonstrated that HCMV infection leads to an increase in monocyte markers ( Zhu et al . , 2018 ) and similar results were shown specifically for the viral gene UL7 ( Crawford et al . , 2018 ) . Our results are in line with these studies and show directly and in an unbiased manner that several days post infection , viral gene expression can be found only in cells in the monocyte lineage . Moreover , within the monocyte lineage primed cells , the cells exhibiting higher viral transcript levels show the same markers and characteristics as we found when infecting CD14+ monocytes , primarily lower expression of CD74 and weaker immune responsiveness . This is especially interesting as it suggests that regardless of the developmental stage in which HCMV infects , the end point , a few days after infection , are cells with very similar characteristics . Overall , we use here single cell data to pinpoint the characteristics of the latently infected cells in an unbiased manner . Our analyses indicate that HCMV drives human HSPCs and monocytes into a monocyte state characterized by anergic-like gene signature . These findings shed light on the characteristics of the latent reservoir , which may help in the effort of developing strategies to eradicate the latently infected cells . 4 Materials and methods Primary CD14+ monocytes were isolated from fresh venous blood , obtained from healthy donors , using Lymphoprep ( Stemcell Technologies ) density gradient followed by magnetic cell sorting with CD14+‏ magnetic beads ( Miltenyi Biotec ) . The cells were cultured in X-Vivo15 media ( Lonza ) supplemented with 2 . 25 mM L-glutamine at 37⁰C in 5% CO2 ( Fortunato , 2014 ) . Primary human foreskin fibroblasts ( HFF ) ( ATCC CRL-1634 ) were maintained in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) , 2 mM L-glutamine , and 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin ( Beit-Haemek , Israel ) . The TB40E virus containing an SV40-GFP tag ( TB40E-GFP ) was described previously ( O'Connor and Murphy , 2012; Sinzger et al . , 2008b ) . Virus was propagated by electroporation of infectious bacterial artificial chromosome ( BAC ) DNA into fibroblasts using the Amaxa P2 4D-Nucleofector kit ( Lonza ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Viral stocks were concentrated by centrifugation at 26000xg , 4⁰C for 120 min . Infectious virus yields were assayed on THP-1 cells ( ATCC TIB-202 ) . For experimental latent infection , CD14+ monocytes were incubated with the virus for 3 hr , washed twice and supplemented with fresh media . To assess infection efficiency , a sample of the infected cell population was FACS analyzed for GFP expression at 3dpi . All experiments were conducted when there was a shift in GFP intensity of the entire population following infection , indicating all cells were infected . HCMV latency was validated by absence of GFP positive plaques on fibroblasts incubated with infected monocytes cell lysate . For reactivation assays , infected monocytes were counted , plated and co-cultured with primary fibroblasts immediately or following differentiation into dendritic cells ( DCs ) . DC differentiation was done by incubation of cells with granulocyte-macrophage CSF and interleukin-4 ( Peprotech ) at 1 , 000 U/ml for 5 days , followed by stimulation with 500 ng/ml of LPS ( Sigma ) for 48 hr ( as previously described in Cobbs et al . , 2014 ) . Release of infectious virions was assayed by quantification of GFP positive plaques on the fibroblasts monolayer . Ruxolitinib ( Ruxo ) was added at a concentration of 4 uM , either immediately after infection ( 3hpi ) or at later time points ( 1 , 2 , or 3dpi ) . Monocytes were washed to remove residual Ruxo before co-culturing with fibroblasts . For analysis of RNA expression , total RNA was extracted using Tri-Reagent ( Sigma ) according to manufacturer’s protocol . cDNA was prepared using qScript cDNA Synthesis Kit ( Quanta Biosciences ) according to manufacturer’s protocol . For analysis of DNA levels , cells were lysed in a 1:1 mixture of PCR solutions A ( 100 mM KCl , 10 mM Tris–HCl pH 8 . 3 , and 2 . 5 mM MgCl2 ) and B ( 10 mM Tris–HCl pH 8 . 3 , 2 . 5 mM MgCl2 , 1% Tween 20 , 1% Non-idet P-40 , and 0 . 4 mg/ml Proteinase K ) , for 60 min at 60°C followed by a 10 min 95°C incubation , as described in Roback et al . ( 2001 ) . Real time PCR was performed using the SYBR Green PCR master-mix ( ABI ) on the QuantStudio 12K Flex ( ABI ) with the following primers ( forward , reverse ) : Viral DNA was quantified with RNA2 . 7 primers , host DNA was measured with the following primers ( forward , reverse ) : Cells were counted , and stained in cold MACS buffer ( PBS , 5% BSA , 2 mM EDTA ) . Cell staining was done using the following antibodies: anti-human APC-CD74 ( Clone: 5–329 , Miltenyi Biotec ) , anti-human PE-HLA-DR , DP , DQ ( clone: REA332 , Miltenyi Biotec ) , anti-human FITC-CD14 ( Clone: TÜK4 , Miltenyi Biotec ) , anti-human APC-B7H4 ( clone: MIH43 , Biolegend ) , APC-Mouse IgG1 isotype control ( clone: MOPC-21 , Biolegend ) according to manufacturer’s instructions . Cells were analyzed and sorted on a BD FACSAriaIII . Detection of viral DNA in monocytes from natural latent samples was done using the QX200 droplet digital PCR system ( Bio-Rad ) , using FAM labeled HCMV primer and probe: Human CMV HHV5 kit for qPCR using a glycoprotein B target ( PrimerDesign ) ; and HEX labeled RPP30 copy number assay for ddPCR ( Bio-Rad ) , as previously described ( Jackson et al . , 2017 ) . Calibration curve was ran in duplicate , using CMV positive control template ( PrimerDesign ) . The limit of detection was 3 events per sample , with accuracy improved at 10 copies and higher ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) . For sample preparation cells were counted , dry pelleted , and stored at −80°C prior to DNA extraction . DNA was extracted from the cell pellet in a 1:1 mixture of PCR solutions A ( 100 mM KCl , 10 mM Tris–HCl pH 8 . 3 , and 2 . 5 mM MgCl2 ) and B ( 10 mM Tris–HCl pH 8 . 3 , 2 . 5 mM MgCl2 , 0 . 25% Tween 20 , 0 . 25% Non-idet P-40 , and 0 . 4 mg/ml Proteinase K ) , for 60 min at 60°C followed by a 10 min 95°C incubation , according to the description in Roback et al . ( 2001 ) . RNA libraries were generated from samples of ~10 , 000 cells according to the MARS-seq protocol ( Jaitin et al . , 2014; Keren-Shaul et al . , 2019 ) . RNA-Seq libraries ( pooled at equimolar concentration ) were performed in duplicates and sequenced using NextSeq 500 ( Illumina ) , with read parameters: Read1: 72 cycles and Read2: 15 cycles . Analysis of bulk MARS-seq of CD14+ monocytes , sorted according to the CD74 cell-surface levels , was done as described previously ( Shnayder et al . , 2018 ) . The number of Unique Molecular Identifiers ( UMIs ) were: 976 , 294 , and 947 , 474 for the CD74high samples , 902 , 150 , and 844 , 872 for the CD74low samples ( Figure 6A–E ) ; 2 , 422 , 356 and 2 , 395 , 329 for the –Ruxo 3dpi samples , 2 , 187 , 290 and 925 , 362 for the +Ruxo 3dpi samples , 4 , 228 , 168 and 3 , 854 , 339 for the –Ruxo 6dpi samples and 3 , 449 , 188 and 1 , 900 , 301 for the +Ruxo 6dpi samples ( Figure 7A and B ) ; 2 , 076 , 741 and 1 , 858 , 871 for the +Ruxo at 1dpi samples , 1 , 914 , 289 and 1 , 163 , 469 for the +Ruxo at 2dpi samples , 1 , 554 , 298 and 1 , 685 , 834 for the +Ruxo at 3dpi samples , 2 , 004 , 859 and 2 , 450 , 039 for the –Ruxo control ( Figure 7C ) . Reads for gene expression and correlation analyses were normalized using DEseq2 . Based on the t-SNE plot of the CD14+ monocyte cells in Shnayder et al . ( 2018 ) , the latent cells were defined as all cells besides the small distinct group of cells that show high levels of viral reads ( mean 9 . 5% ) . All the analyses in this paper include only the remaining 3 , 416 cells . For calculating the Spearman correlation between host genes and either viral expression levels or dpi , in each cell , the sum of viral reads was normalized to the total number of reads in the cell , and the number of reads of each host gene was normalized to the total number of host reads in the cell . The correlation was calculated across 1 , 448 cells for 6997 genes . Cells with no viral reads , or with less than 700 different host genes expressed , were omitted . Genes with total number of reads less than 20 were ignored . The Z-score was calculated based on the mean and the standard deviation calculated over all 6997 genes . Color coding of t-SNE ( Figure 1C , Figure 6D and Figure 7B ) or Monocle ( e . g . Figure 7C , G , H ) plots for expression levels of groups of genes was calculated according to the average relative expression as follows: First , genes with low level of expression , that is expressed in less than 50 cells , were omitted . Next , the number of host reads per cell was normalized so that all cells will include the same number of reads . Next , for each cell and each gene , the relative expression is calculated as log2 ( rij+1ri-+1 ) where rij is the number of reads of gene i in cell j and ri- is the average number of reads of gene i over all cells . Finally , for each cell the average log2 relative expression over all genes in the group was calculated . The differential expression analysis was done with DESeq2 ( version 1 . 22 . 2 ) ( Love et al . , 2014 ) using default parameters , with the number of reads in each of the samples as an input . The normalized number of reads according to DESeq2 were used for enrichment analysis using GSEA ( version 3 . 0 ) ( Subramanian et al . , 2005 ) . The genes sets that were used were GO biological process ( c5 . bp ) and REACTOME ( c2 . cp . reactome ) from MSigDB ( version 6 . 2 ) ( Liberzon et al . , 2011 ) and the monocyte progenitor gene list from Velten et al . ( 2017 ) . The GSEA plots were created based on the GSEA output with the R package enrichplot . To calculate differential expression and pathway enrichment within the distinct group of cells that expressed monocyte priming markers , we used the graph-based clustering of the Cell Ranger software , stratifying this group of cells into two distinct clusters and GSEA ( version 3 . 0 ) ( Subramanian et al . , 2005 ) for pathway enrichment . Differential expression and enrichment analysis were done on these two clusters . Enrichment of M1 and M2 associated genes was done by hypergeometric test taking all genes with mean expression ≥5 as background . CD34+ cells were ordered according to the predicted pseudo-time using Monocle ( version 2 . 10 . 1 ) ( Trapnell et al . , 2014 ) . The cells used in this analysis were filtered to have at least 1000 expressed genes and not more than 10 , 000 UMIs , while the genes were filtered to have mean expression greater than 0 . 1 , and empirical dispersion greater than the global dispersion fit . All fresh peripheral blood samples were obtained after approval of protocols by the Weizmann Institutional Review Board ( IRB application 92–1 ) . The study using HSCT recipient samples was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the University of Sydney and the Western Sydney Local Health District . Informed consent was obtained from all study participants prior to enrolment in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki ."}

Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 ( APS1 ) , a rare monogenic form of autoimmunity , presents as widespread autoimmunity with T and B cell responses to multiple organs . Importantly , autoantibody discovery in APS1 can illuminate fundamental disease pathogenesis , and many of the antigens found in APS1 extend to more common autoimmune diseases . Here , we performed proteome-wide programmable phage-display ( PhIP-Seq ) on sera from a cohort of people with APS1 and discovered multiple common antibody targets . These novel APS1 autoantigens exhibit tissue-restricted expression , including expression in enteroendocrine cells , pineal gland , and dental enamel . Using detailed clinical phenotyping , we find novel associations between autoantibodies and organ-restricted autoimmunity , including a link between anti-KHDC3L autoantibodies and premature ovarian insufficiency , and between anti-RFX6 autoantibodies and diarrheal-type intestinal dysfunction . Our study highlights the utility of PhIP-Seq for extensively interrogating antigenic repertoires in human autoimmunity and the importance of antigen discovery for improved understanding of disease mechanisms .", "plain language summary": "The immune system uses antibodies to fight microbes that cause disease . White blood cells pump antibodies into the bloodstream , and these antibodies latch onto bacteria and viruses , targeting them for destruction . But sometimes , the immune system gets it wrong . In autoimmune diseases , white blood cells mistakenly make antibodies that target the body's own tissues . Detecting these 'autoantibodies' in the blood can help doctors to diagnose autoimmune diseases . But the identities and targets of many autoantibodies remain unknown . In one rare disease , called autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 ( APS-1 ) , a faulty gene makes the immune system much more likely to make autoantibodies . People with this disease can develop an autoimmune response against many different healthy organs . Although APS-1 is rare , some of the autoantibodies made by individuals with the disease are the same as the ones in more common autoimmune diseases , like type 1 diabetes . Therefore , investigating the other autoantibodies produced by individuals with APS-1 could reveal the autoantibodies driving other autoimmune diseases . Autoantibodies bind to specific regions of healthy proteins , and one way to identify them is to use hundreds of thousands of tiny viruses in a technique called proteome-wide programmable phage-display , or PhIP-Seq . Each phage carries one type of protein segment . When mixed with blood serum from a patient , the autoantibodies stick to the phages that carry the target proteins for that autoantibody . These complexes can be isolated using biochemical techniques . Sequencing the genes of these phages then reveals the identity of the autoantibodies’ targets . Using this technique , Vazquez et al successfully pulled 23 known autoantibodies from the serum of patients with APS-1 . Then , experiments to search for new targets began . This revealed many new autoantibodies , targeting proteins found only in specific tissues . They included one that targets a protein found on cells in the gut , and another that targets a protein found on egg cells in the ovaries . Matching the PhIP-Seq data to patient symptoms confirmed that these new antibodies correlate with the features of specific autoimmune diseases . For example , patients with antibodies that targeted the gut protein were more likely to have gut symptoms , while patients with antibodies that targeted the egg cell protein were more likely to have problems with their ovaries . Further investigations using PhIP-Seq could reveal the identities of even more autoantibodies . This might pave the way for new antibody tests to diagnose autoimmune diseases and identify tissues at risk of damage . This could be useful not only for people with APS-1 , but also for more common autoimmune diseases that target the same organs .", "article": "1 Introduction Autoimmune Polyglandular syndrome type 1 ( APS1 ) or Autoimmune Polyglandular-Candidiasis-Ectodermal Dystrophy ( APECED; OMIM #240300 ) is an autoimmune syndrome caused by monogenic mutations in the AIRE gene that result in defects in AIRE-dependent T cell education in the thymus ( Aaltonen et al . , 1997; Anderson et al . , 2002; Conteduca et al . , 2018; Malchow et al . , 2016; Nagamine et al . , 1997 ) . As a result , people with APS1 develop autoimmunity to multiple organs , including endocrine organs , skin , gut , and lung ( Ahonen et al . , 1990; Ferre et al . , 2016; Söderbergh et al . , 2004 ) . Although the majority of APS1 autoimmune manifestations are thought to be primarily driven by autoreactive T cells , people with APS1 also possess autoreactive B cells and corresponding high-affinity autoantibody responses ( Devoss et al . , 2008; Gavanescu et al . , 2008; Meyer et al . , 2016; Sng et al . , 2019 ) . These autoantibodies likely derive from germinal center reactions driven by self-reactive T cells , resulting in mirroring of autoantigen identities between the T and B cell compartments ( Lanzavecchia , 1985; Meyer et al . , 2016 ) . Identification of the specificity of autoantibodies in autoimmune diseases is important for understanding underlying disease pathogenesis and for identifying those at risk for disease ( Rosen and Casciola-Rosen , 2014 ) . However , despite the long-known association of autoantibodies with specific diseases in both monogenic and sporadic autoimmunity , many autoantibody specificities remain undiscovered . Challenges in antigen identification include the weak affinity of some autoantibodies for their target antigen , as well as rare or low expression of the target antigen . One approach to overcome some of these challenges is to interrogate autoimmune patient samples with particularly high affinity autoantibodies . Indeed , such an approach identified GAD65 as a major autoantigen in type 1 diabetes by using sera from people with Stiff Person Syndrome ( OMIM #184850 ) , who harbor high affinity autoantibodies ( Baekkeskov et al . , 1990 ) . We reasoned that PhIP-Seq interrogation of APS1 , a defined monogenic autoimmune syndrome with a broad spectrum of high affinity autoantibodies , would likely yield clinically meaningful targets – consistent with previously described APS1 autoantibody specificities that exhibit strong , clinically useful associations with their respective organ-specific diseases ( Alimohammadi et al . , 2008; Alimohammadi et al . , 2009; Ferré et al . , 2019; Landegren et al . , 2015; Popler et al . , 2012; Puel et al . , 2010; Shum et al . , 2013; Söderbergh et al . , 2004; Winqvist et al . , 1993 ) . The identification of key B cell autoantigens in APS1 has occurred most commonly through candidate-based approaches and by whole-protein microarrays . For example , lung antigen BPIFB1 autoantibodies , which are used to assess people with APS1 for risk of interstitial lung disease , were discovered first in Aire-deficient mice using a combination of targeted immunoblotting , tissue microscopy , and mass spectrometry ( Shum et al . , 2009; Shum et al . , 2013 ) . Recently , there have been rapid advances in large platform approaches for antibody screening; these platforms can overcome problems of antigen abundance by simultaneously screening the majority of proteins from the human genome in an unbiased fashion ( Jeong et al . , 2012; Larman et al . , 2011; Sharon and Snyder , 2014; Zhu et al . , 2001 ) . In particular , a higher-throughput antibody target profiling approach utilizing a fixed protein microarray technology ( ProtoArray ) has enabled detection of a wider range of proteins targeted by autoantibodies directly from human serum ( Fishman et al . , 2017; Landegren et al . , 2016; Meyer et al . , 2016 ) . Despite initial success of this technology in uncovering shared antigens across APS1 cohorts , it is likely that many shared antigens remain to be discovered , given that these arrays do not encompass the full coding potential of the proteome . Here , we took an alternate approach to APS1 antigen discovery by employing Phage Immunoprecipitation-Sequencing ( PhIP-Seq ) based on an established proteome-wide tiled library ( Larman et al . , 2011; O’Donovan et al . , 2018 ) . This approach possesses many potential advantages over previous candidate-based and whole-protein fixed array approaches , including ( 1 ) expanded , proteome-wide coverage ( including alternative splice forms ) with 49 amino acid ( AA ) peptide length and 24AA resolution tiling , ( 2 ) reduced volume requirement for human serum , and ( 3 ) high-throughput , sequencing based output ( Larman et al . , 2011; O’Donovan et al . , 2018 ) . Of note , the PhIP-Seq investigation of autoimmune diseases of the central nervous system , including paraneoplastic disease , has yielded novel and specific biomarkers of disease ( Larman et al . , 2011; Mandel-Brehm et al . , 2019; O’Donovan et al . , 2018 ) . Using a PhIP-Seq autoantibody survey , we identify a collection of novel APS1 autoantigens as well as numerous known , literature-reported APS1 autoantigens . We orthogonally validate seven novel autoantigens including RFX6 , KHDC3L , and ACP4 , all of which exhibit tissue-restricted expression ( Patel et al . , 2017; Rezaei et al . , 2016; Seymen et al . , 2016; Smith et al . , 2017; Smith et al . , 2010; Zhu et al . , 2015 ) . Importantly , these novel autoantigens may carry important implications for poorly understood clinical manifestations such as intestinal dysfunction , ovarian insufficiency , and tooth enamel hypoplasia , where underlying cell-type specific antigens have remained elusive . Together , our results demonstrate the applicability of PhIP-Seq to antigen discovery , substantially expand the spectrum of known antibody targets and clinical associations in APS1 , and point towards novel specificities that can be targeted in autoimmunity . 2 Results Individuals with APS1 develop autoantibodies to many known protein targets , some of which exhibit tissue-restricted expression and have been shown to correlate with specific autoimmune disease manifestations . However , the target proteins for many of the APS1 tissue-specific manifestations remain enigmatic . To this end , we employed a high-throughput , proteome-wide programmable phage display approach ( PhIP-Seq ) to query the antibody target identities within serum of people with APS1 ( Larman et al . , 2011; O’Donovan et al . , 2018 ) . The PhIP-Seq technique leverages large scale oligo production and efficient phage packaging and expression to present a tiled-peptide representation of the proteome displayed on T7 phage . Here , we utilize a phage library that we previously designed and deployed for investigating paraneoplastic autoimmune encephalitis ( Mandel-Brehm et al . , 2019; O’Donovan et al . , 2018 ) . The library itself contains approximately 700 , 000 unique phage , each displaying a 49 amino acid proteome segment . As previously described , phage were immunoprecipitated using human antibodies bound to protein A/G beads . In order to increase sensitivity and specificity for target proteins , eluted phage were used for a further round of amplification and immunoprecipitation . DNA was then extracted from the final phage elution , amplified and barcoded , and subjected to Next-Generation Sequencing ( Figure 1A ) . Finally , sequencing counts were normalized across samples to correct for variability in sequencing depth , and the fold-change of each gene was calculated ( comprised of multiple unique tiling phage ) as compared to mock IPs in the absence of human serum ( further details of the protocol can be found in the methods section ) . From a cohort of 67 APS1 serum samples , a total of 39 samples were subjected to PhIP-Seq investigation , while the remaining 28 samples were obtained at a later time point and reserved for downstream validation experiments ( for clinical data , refer to Supplementary file 1 ) . In addition , 28 non-APS1 anonymous blood donor serum samples were subjected to PhIP-Seq , and an additional group of 61 non-APS1 plasma samples were used for downstream validation experiments ( Supplementary file 2 ) . PhIP-Seq results were first cross-referenced with previously reported APS1 autoantibody targets ( Alimohammadi et al . , 2008; Alimohammadi et al . , 2009; Clemente et al . , 1997; Fishman et al . , 2017; Hedstrand et al . , 2001; Husebye et al . , 1997; Kluger et al . , 2015; Kuroda et al . , 2005; Landegren et al . , 2015; Landegren et al . , 2016; Leonard et al . , 2017; Meager et al . , 2006; Meyer et al . , 2016; Oftedal et al . , 2015; Pöntynen et al . , 2006; Sansom et al . , 2014; Shum et al . , 2009; Shum et al . , 2013; Söderbergh et al . , 2004 ) . To avoid false positives , a conservative set of criteria were used as follows . We required a minimum of 2/39 APS1 samples and 0/28 non-APS1 control samples to exhibit normalized gene counts in the immunoprecipitation ( IP ) with greater than 10-fold enrichment as compared to the control set of 17 mock-IP ( beads , no serum ) samples . This simple , yet stringent criteria enabled detection of a total of 23 known autoantibody specificities ( Figure 1B ) . Importantly , many of the well-validated APS1 antigens , including specific members of the cytochrome P450 family ( CYP1A2 , CYP21A1 , CYP11A1 , CYP17A1 ) , lung disease-associated antigen KCRNG , as well as IL17A , IL17F , and IL22 , among others were well represented ( Figure 1B ) . In contrast , the diabetes-associated antigens GAD65 and INS did not meet these stringent detection criteria and only weak signal was detected to many of the known interferon autoantibody targets known to be present in many people with APS1 , perhaps due to the conformational nature of these autoantigens ( Figure 1B and Figure 1—figure supplement 1; Björk et al . , 1994; Meager et al . , 2006; Meyer et al . , 2016; Wolff et al . , 2013; Ziegler et al . , 1996 ) . Three known autoantigens that were prevalent within our cohort were selected to determine how PhIP-Seq performed against an orthogonal whole protein-based antibody detection assay . A radioligand binding assay ( RLBA ) was performed by immunoprecipitating in vitro transcribed and translated S35-labeled proteins CYP11A1 , SOX10 , and NLRP5 with APS1 serum ( Alimohammadi et al . , 2008; Berson et al . , 1956; Hedstrand et al . , 2001; Winqvist et al . , 1993 ) . Importantly , and in contrast to PhIP-Seq , this assay tests for antibody binding to full-length protein ( Figure 1C ) . By RLBA , these three antigens were present in and specific to both the initial discovery APS1 cohort ( n = 39 ) as well as the expanded validation cohort ( n = 28 ) , but not the non-APS1 control cohort ( n = 61 ) . Together , these results demonstrate that PhIP-Seq detects known APS1 autoantigens and that PhIP-Seq results validate well in orthogonal whole protein-based assays . To determine whether the PhIP-Seq APS1 dataset could yield higher resolution information on antigenic peptide sequences with respect to previously reported targets , the normalized enrichments of all peptides belonging to known disease-associated antigens CYP11A1 and SOX10 were mapped across the full length of their respective proteins ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ) . The antigenic regions within these proteins were observed to be similar across all samples positive for anti-CYP11A1 and anti-SOX10 antibodies , respectively ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ) suggesting peptide-level commonalities and convergence among the autoreactive antibody repertoires across individuals . These data suggest that people with APS1 often target similar , but not identical protein regions . Having confirmed that PhIP-Seq analysis of APS1 sera detected known antigens , the same data were then investigated for the presence of novel , previously uncharacterized APS1 autoantigens . We applied the same positive hit criteria as described for known antigens , and additionally increased the required number of positive APS1 samples to 3/39 to impose a stricter limit on the number of novel candidate autoantigens . This yielded a list of 81 genes , which included 12 known antigens and 69 putative novel antigens ( Figure 2 ) . The most commonly held hypotheses regarding the nature and identity of proteins targeted by the aberrant immune response in APS1 are that targeted proteins ( 1 ) tend to exhibit AIRE-dependent thymic expression and ( 2 ) have restricted expression to one or few peripheral organs and tend not to be widely or ubiquitously expressed . We investigated whether our novel antigens were also preferentially tissue-restricted . In order to systematically address this question , tissue-specific RNA expression was assessed using a consensus expression dataset across 74 cell types and tissues ( Uhlén et al . , 2015 ) . For each gene , the ratio of expression in the highest tissue as compared to the sum of expression across all tissues was calculated , resulting in higher ratios for those mRNAs with greater degrees of tissue-restriction . Using this approach , the mean tissue-specificity ratio of the 81 PhIP-Seq positive antigens was increased by approximately 1 . 5-fold ( p=0 . 0017 ) as compared to the means from iterative sampling of 81 genes ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) . Identified autoantigens were ranked by frequency within the cohort . Five antigens were positive in ten or more APS1 samples , including two novel antigens . In addition , the majority of antigens found in 4 or more APS1 sera were novel ( Figure 3A ) . Five of the most frequent novel antigens were selected for subsequent validation and follow-up . These included RFX6 , a transcription factor implicated in pancreatic and intestinal pathology ( Patel et al . , 2017; Smith et al . , 2010 ) ; ACP4 , an enzyme implicated in dental enamel hypoplasia ( Choi et al . , 2016; Seymen et al . , 2016; Smith et al . , 2017 ) ; KHDC3L , a protein with oocyte-restricted expression ( Li et al . , 2008; Zhang et al . , 2018; Zhu et al . , 2015 ) ; NKX6-3 , a gastrointestinal transcription factor ( Alanentalo et al . , 2006 ) ; and GIP , a gastrointestinal peptide involved in intestinal motility and energy homeostasis ( Adriaenssens et al . , 2019; Jörnvall et al . , 1981; Moody et al . , 1984; Pederson and McIntosh , 2016 ) . Several less frequent ( but still shared ) novel antigens were also chosen for validation , including ASMT , a pineal gland enzyme involved in melatonin synthesis ( Ackermann et al . , 2006; Rath et al . , 2016 ) ; and PDX1 , an intestinal and pancreatic transcription factor ( Holland et al . , 2002; Stoffers et al . , 1997; Figure 3A ) . Of note , this group of seven novel antigens all exhibited either tissue enriched , tissue enhanced , or group enhanced expression according to the Human Protein Atlas database ( https://www . proteinatlas . org/about/download; Uhlén et al . , 2015; Supplementary file 3 ) . Using a whole-protein radiolabeled binding assay ( RLBA ) for validation , all seven proteins were immunoprecipitated by antibodies in both the PhIP-Seq APS1 discovery cohort ( n = 39 ) , as well as in the validation cohort of APS1 sera that had not been interrogated by PhIP-Seq ( n = 28 ) . Whereas an expanded set of non-APS1 controls ( n = 61 ) produced little to no immunoprecipitation signal by RLBA as compared to positive control antibodies ( low antibody index ) , APS1 samples yielded significant immunoprecipitation signal enrichment for each whole protein assay ( high antibody index ) ( Figure 3B and Supplementary file 4 ) . The comparison of PhIP-Seq data to the results from the RLBAs ( n = 39 , discovery cohort only ) yielded positive correlations between the two datasets ( r = 0 . 62–0 . 95; Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) . Notably , for some antigens , such as NLRP5 , and particularly for ASMT , the RLBA results revealed additional autoantibody-positive samples not detected by PhIP-Seq ( Figure 3B and Figure 3—figure supplement 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ) . Because the individuals in this APS1 cohort have been extensively phenotyped for 24 clinical manifestations , the PhIP-Seq APS1 data was queried for phenotypic associations . Several autoantibody specificities , both known and novel , were found to possess highly significant associations with several clinical phenotypes ( Figure 4 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) . Among these were the associations of KHDC3L with ovarian insufficiency , RFX6 with diarrheal-type intestinal dysfunction , CYP11A1 ( also known as cholesterol side chain cleavage enzyme ) with adrenal insufficiency ( AI ) , and SOX10 with vitiligo ( Figure 4 ) . Strikingly , anti-CYP11A1 antibodies are present in AI and are known to predict disease development ( Betterle et al . , 2002; Petra et al . , 2000; Winqvist et al . , 1993 ) . Similarly , antibodies to SOX10 , a transcription factor involved in melanocyte differentiation and maintenance , have been previously shown to correlate with the presence of autoimmune vitiligo ( Hedstrand et al . , 2001 ) . Primary ovarian insufficiency is a highly penetrant phenotype , with an estimated 60% of females with APS1 progressing to an early , menopause-like state ( Ahonen et al . , 1990; Ferre et al . , 2016 ) . Interestingly , a set of 5 proteins ( KHDC3L , SRSF8 , PNO1 , RASIP1 , and MORC2 ) exhibited a significant association with ovarian insufficiency in this cohort ( Figure 4 ) . A publicly available RNA-sequencing dataset from human oocytes and supporting granulosa cells of the ovary confirmed that of these 5 genes , only KHDC3L exhibited expression levels in female oocytes comparable to the expression levels seen for the known oocyte markers NLRP5 and DDX4 ( Zhang et al . , 2018; Figure 4—figure supplement 2 ) . We therefore chose to further investigate the relationship between anti-KHDC3L antibodies and ovarian insufficiency in our cohort ( Figure 5 ) . KHDC3L is a well-studied molecular binding partner of NLRP5 within the ovary ( Li et al . , 2008; Zhu et al . , 2015 ) . Together , NLRP5 and KHDC3L form part of a critical oocyte-specific molecular complex , termed the subcortical maternal complex ( SCMC ) ( Bebbere et al . , 2016; Li et al . , 2008; Liu et al . , 2016; Zhu et al . , 2015 ) . Furthermore , knockout of the NLRP5 and KHDC3L in female mice results in fertility defects , and human genetic mutations in these genes of the SCMC have been linked to infertility and molar pregnancies ( Akoury et al . , 2015; Li et al . , 2008; Reddy et al . , 2013; Wang et al . , 2018; Zhang et al . , 2019 ) . Interestingly , previous work established NLRP5 as a parathyroid-specific antigen in APS1 , with potential for additional correlation with ovarian insufficiency ( Alimohammadi et al . , 2008; Brozzetti et al . , 2015 ) . However , anti-NLRP5 antibodies lack sensitivity for ovarian insufficiency . Importantly , unlike NLRP5 , KHDC3L is expressed primarily in the ovary , and thus potentially represents a more oocyte-specific autoantigen ( Liu et al . , 2016; Virant-Klun et al . , 2016; Zhang et al . , 2018 ) . Using the dataset from Zhang et . al , we confirmed that KHDC3L , as well as NLRP5 and the known oocyte marker DDX4 , are highly expressed within the oocyte population , but not in the supporting granulosa cell types ( Zhang et al . , 2018; Figure 5A ) . Interestingly , the majority ( 64% ) of APS1 sera had a concordant status for antibodies to KHDC3L and NLRP5 ( Figure 5B ) . Although previous reports did not find a strong gender prevalence within samples positive for anti-NLRP5 antibodies , the mean anti-NLRP5 and anti-KHDC3L antibody signals were increased in females in this cohort ( by 1 . 6- and 2 . 1-fold , respectively; Figure 5C ) . Finally , all 10 females in the expanded APS1 cohort with diagnosed ovarian insufficiency were also positive for anti-KHDC3L antibodies ( Figure 5D ) . Similar to known antigens CYP11A1 , SOX10 , and LCN1 , the novel antigen ACP4 was found to occur at high frequencies in this cohort ( Figure 3A ) . ACP4 ( acid phosphatase 4 ) is highly expressed in dental enamel , and familial mutations in the ACP4 gene result in dental enamel hypoplasia similar to the enamel hypoplasia seen in ~90% of this APS1 cohort ( Seymen et al . , 2016; Smith et al . , 2017 ) . Strikingly , 50% of samples were positive for anti-ACP4 antibodies by RLBA , with excellent correlation between RLBA and PhIP-Seq data ( Figure 3B and Figure 3—figure supplement 1A ) . Consistently , samples from individuals with enamel hypoplasia exhibited a trend towards higher anti-ACP4 antibody signal by RLBA ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1B , p=0 . 064 ) . In this cohort , 82% ( 55/67 ) of APS1 sera exhibited an RFX6 signal that was at least 3 standard deviations above the mean of non-APS1 control signal due to the extremely low RFX6 signal across all non-APS1 controls by RLBA ( Figure 3B ) . Using a more stringent cutoff for RFX6 positivity by RLBA at 6 standard deviations above the mean , 65% of APS1 samples were positive for anti-RFX6 antibodies . RFX6 is expressed in both intestine and pancreas , and loss of function RFX6 variants in humans lead to both intestinal and pancreatic pathology ( Gehart et al . , 2019; Patel et al . , 2017; Piccand et al . , 2019; Smith et al . , 2010 ) . Interestingly , across all samples with anti-RFX6 antibodies , the response targeted multiple sites within the protein , suggesting a polyclonal antibody response ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1A ) . The extent and frequency of intestinal dysfunction in people with APS1 has only recently been clinically uncovered and reported , and therefore still lacks unifying diagnostic markers as well as specific intestinal target antigen identities ( Ferre et al . , 2016 ) . This investigation of APS1 sera revealed several antigens that are expressed in the intestine , including RFX6 , GIP , PDX1 , and NKX6-3 . We chose to further study whether autoimmune response to RFX6+ cells in the intestine was involved in APS1-associated intestinal dysfunction . Using a publicly available murine single-cell RNA sequencing dataset of 16 different organs and over 120 different cell types , RFX6 expression was confirmed to be present in and restricted to pancreatic islets and intestinal enteroendocrine cells ( Schaum et al . , 2018; Figure 6—figure supplement 1B and C ) . Serum from an individual with APS1-associated intestinal dysfunction and anti-RFX6 antibodies was next tested for reactivity against human intestinal enteroendocrine cells , revealing strong nuclear staining that colocalized with ChromograninA ( ChgA ) , a well-characterized marker of intestinal enteroendocrine cells ( Goldspink et al . , 2018; O'Connor et al . , 1983; Figure 6A , right panel and inset ) . In contrast , enteroendocrine cell staining was not observed from APS1 samples that lacked anti-RFX6 antibodies or from non-APS1 control samples . ( Figure 6A , center and left panels ) . Furthermore , serum from samples with anti-RFX6 antibodies stained transfected tissue culture cells expressing RFX6 ( Figure 6B , Figure 6—figure supplement 2 ) . These data support the notion that there exists a specific antibody signature , typified by anti-RFX6 antibodies , associated with enteroendocrine cells in APS1 . Both mice and humans with biallelic mutation of the gene encoding RFX6 have enteroendocrine cell deficiency and intestinal malabsorption ( Mitchell et al . , 2004; Piccand et al . , 2019; Smith et al . , 2010 ) , and humans with other forms of genetic or acquired enteroendocrine cell deficiency also suffer from chronic malabsorptive diarrhea ( Högenauer et al . , 2001; Mitchell et al . , 2004; Oliva-Hemker et al . , 2006; Posovszky et al . , 2012; Wang et al . , 2006 ) . In this cohort , 54/67 ( 81% ) of individuals have intestinal dysfunction defined as the presence of chronic diarrhea , chronic constipation or an alternating pattern of both , without meeting ROME III diagnostic criteria for irritable bowel syndrome , as previously described ( Ferre et al . , 2016 ) . When the cohort was subsetted by presence or absence of intestinal dysfunction , the anti-RFX6 RLBA signal was significantly higher when intestinal dysfunction was present ( Figure 6C ) . Further subsetting of the cohort by subtype of intestinal dysfunction revealed that individuals with anti-RFX6 antibodies belonged preferentially to the diarrheal-type ( as opposed to constipation-type ) group of intestinal dysfunction ( Figure 6D and Figure 6—figure supplement 3A ) . In contrast , antibodies to the known intestinal antigen TPH1 were distributed less specifically across both types ( diarrheal- and constipation-type ) of ID , despite a high frequency of both anti-TPH1 and anti-RFX6 in the cohort ( 55/67 for anti-RFX6 , 45/67 for anti-TPH1 ) ( Figure 6—figure supplement 3C and D ) . These observations are consistent with a previous report that anti-TPH1 antibodies show an association with ID , but not specifically with the diarrheal subtype ( Kluger et al . , 2015 ) . Given that RFX6 is also expressed in the pancreas , we also examined the association of anti-RFX6 antibodies with APS1-associated type 1 diabetes . We observed that 6/7 APS1-associated type 1 diabetes samples had positive signal for anti-RFX6 antibodies by RLBA ( Figure 6—figure supplement 3B ) . However , due to small sample size , an expanded cohort would be needed to determine the significance of this observation . Together , these data suggest that RFX6 is a common , shared autoantigen in APS1 that may be involved in the immune response to intestinal enteroendocrine cells as well as pancreatic islets . Future studies will help to determine whether testing for anti-RFX6 antibodies possesses clinical utility for prediction or diagnosis of specific APS1 autoimmune disease manifestations as well as for non-APS1 autoimmune disease . 3 Discussion Here , we have identified a new set of autoantigens that are associated with autoimmune features in APS1 by using the broad-based antigen screening platform of PhIP-Seq . Unlike fixed protein arrays , programmable phage display possesses the advantage of being able to comprehensively cover all annotated proteins and their isoforms . The PhIP-Seq library used here is composed of over 700 , 000 peptides , each 49 amino acids , and corresponding to approximately 20 , 000 proteins and their known splicing isoforms . This is highly complementary to recently published protein arrays that cover approximately 9000 distinct proteins ( Fishman et al . , 2017; Landegren et al . , 2016; Meyer et al . , 2016 ) . Recent protein array approaches with APS1 samples using strict cutoffs have been able to identify a number of new autoantigen targets that include PDILT and MAGEB2 ( Landegren et al . , 2016 ) . Several new targets , including RFX6 , KHDC3L , ACP4 , NKX6-3 , ASMT , and PDX1 , were likely discovered here because these antigens were not present on previously published protein array platforms . Only a subset of the novel targets identified here were validated orthogonally . While none failed validation relative to non-APS1 controls , further validation work will be needed for the many additional novel targets identified by PhIP-Seq . It is also worth mentioning that the PhIP-Seq method leverages continuing declines in the cost of oligonucleotide synthesis and Next-Generation Sequencing . Both technologies benefit from economies of scale , and once constructed , a PhIP-Seq phage library may be propagated in large quantities at negligible cost . The primary disadvantage of PhIP-Seq is the fact that conformation specific antibodies are likely to be missed , unless short linear subsequences carry significant binding energy . For example , PhIP-Seq detected only limited signal towards some literature reported antigens , including GAD65 and interferon family proteins in this APS1 cohort . Given that these antigens have been reported to involve conformational epitopes , antibodies to these antigens would not be predicted to be easily detected by linear peptides ( Björk et al . , 1994; Meager et al . , 2006; Meyer et al . , 2016; Wolff et al . , 2013; Ziegler et al . , 1996 ) . Nonetheless , the ability to detect anti-interferon antibodies in a subset of APS1 samples highlights the utility of PhIP-Seq for antigen discovery despite decreased sensitivity for certain epitopes ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . People with ( Anderson et al . , 2002; Cheng and Anderson , 2018; Husebye et al . , 2018; Malchow et al . , 2016 ) APS1 develop autoimmune manifestations over the course of many years , and it is thought that each manifestation may be explained by autoimmune response to one or few initial protein targets . In principle , these target proteins would most likely ( 1 ) exhibit thymic AIRE-dependency and ( 2 ) be restricted to the single or narrow range of tissues associated with the corresponding autoimmune disease . For example , adrenal insufficiency , which results from autoimmune response to cells of the adrenal gland , is thought to occur due to targeting of adrenally-expressed cytochrome p450 family members ( Petra et al . , 2000; Winqvist et al . , 1993 ) . However , a more complete understanding of the protein target spectrum paired with clinical phenotypic associations has been lacking . This , combined with the limited applicability of murine observations to the human disease , has left the question of which clinical characteristics best associate with APS1 autoantigens a heavily debated subject ( Pöntynen et al . , 2006 ) . Testing for defined autoantibody specificities provides substantial clinical benefit for prediction and diagnosis of autoimmune disease . A primary goal of this study was to identify autoantigens with potential clinical significance; consistently , our analyses focused primarily on antigens that appeared across multiple samples , rather than autoantigens that were restricted to individual samples . Using conservative inclusion criteria , we discovered 69 novel autoantigens that were shared across a minimum of 3 APS1 samples , of which 7/7 were successfully validated at the whole protein level . Overall , we have expanded the known repertoire of common APS1 antigens , confirming that the antibody target repertoire of common antigens in APS1 is larger than previously appreciated . Interestingly , our data also suggest that the size of the commonly autoantibody-targeted repertoire of proteins is dramatically lower than the number of genes ( ~4000 ) that exhibit AIRE-dependent thymic expression . The spectrum of different autoimmune diseases that can be observed in APS1 is extensive and has continued to expand through investigation of larger cohorts ( Ahonen et al . , 1990; Bruserud et al . , 2016; Ferre et al . , 2016 ) . In this study , clinical metadata encompassing disease status across 24 individual disease manifestations in a total of 67 people with APS1 was leveraged to uncover ( among others ) an association of anti-KHDC3L antibodies and ovarian insufficiency , a disease that affects over half of all women with APS1 and manifests as abnormal menstrual cycling , reduced fertility , and early menopause . While autoreactivity to the steroidogenic granulosa cells – the cells surrounding and supporting the oocytes – has been proposed as one etiology of the clinical ovarian insufficiency , it has also been suggested that there may exist an autoimmune response to the oocyte itself ( Jasti et al . , 2012; Maclaren et al . , 2001; Otsuka et al . , 2011; Petra et al . , 2000; Welt , 2008 ) . Our finding that females with APS1-associated ovarian insufficiency exhibit autoantibodies to KHDC3L , an oocyte specific protein , supports this hypothesis . As exemplified by autoantibody presence in other autoimmune conditions , anti-KHDC3L antibodies may also have predictive value . Specifically , in our cohort , we found anti-KHDC3L antibodies to be present in many young , pre-menstrual females; these observations will require additional studies in prospective , longitudinal cohorts for further evaluation of potential predictive value . Interestingly , primary ovarian insufficiency ( POI ) in the absence of AIRE-deficiency is increasingly common and affects an estimated 1 in 100 women; up to half of these cases have been proposed to have autoimmune etiology ( Huhtaniemi et al . , 2018; Jasti et al . , 2012; Nelson , 2009; Silva et al . , 2014 ) . The detection of anti-NLRP5 antibodies in a small subset of patients with non-APS1 ovarian insufficiency in a previous study further underlines the importance of evaluating the prevalence of anti-KHDC3L antibodies in women with POI ( Brozzetti et al . , 2015 ) . We noted that the majority of samples with antibodies to KHDC3L also exhibited antibodies to NLRP5 , and vice versa . Remarkably , both of these proteins are critical parts of a subcortical maternal complex ( SCMC ) in both human and murine oocytes ( Li et al . , 2008; Zhu et al . , 2015 ) . Indeed , ‘multi-pronged’ targeting of the same pathway has been previously implicated in APS1 , where antibodies to DDC and TPH1 – enzymes in the serotonin and melatonin synthesis pathways – have been described ( Ekwall et al . , 1998; Husebye et al . , 1997; Kluger et al . , 2015; Rorsman et al . , 1995 ) . In addition to these targets , our data revealed an additional autoantibody-targeted enzyme ASMT in the same melatonin synthesis pathway . While the earlier TPH1- and DDC-catalyzed steps occur in both the intestine and pineal gland and precede the formation of serotonin , ASMT is predominantly expressed in the pineal gland and catalyzes the last , post-serotonin step in melatonin synthesis , suggesting that targeting of this pathway occurs at multiple distinct steps . To our knowledge , this is the first reported autoantigen in APS1 whose expression is restricted to the central nervous system . In past and ongoing investigations , some individuals with APS1 have been reported to feature histologic loss of intestinal enteroendocrine cells on biopsy ( Högenauer et al . , 2001; Oliva-Hemker et al . , 2006; Posovszky et al . , 2012; Natarajan et al . , manuscript in preparation ) . The association of anti-RFX6 antibodies with the diarrheal type of intestinal dysfunction is consistent with published studies in murine models of Rfx6 ( and enteroendocrine cell ) ablation ( Piccand et al . , 2019; Smith et al . , 2010 ) . In addition , human enteroendocrine cell deficiency as well as mutations in enteroendocrine gene NEUROG3 have been linked to chronic diarrhea and malabsorption , and recently , intestinal enteroendocrine cells have been suggested to play a role in mediating intestinal immune tolerance ( Ohsie et al . , 2009; Sifuentes-Dominguez et al . , 2019; Wang et al . , 2006 ) . In sum , although APS1-associated intestinal dysfunction may have multiple etiologies , including autoimmune enteritis or dysfunction of exocrine pancreas , our findings of highly prevalent anti-RFX6 antibodies provide evidence of a common , shared autoantigen involved with this disease phenotype . In addition , patients with type 1 diabetes alone ( not in association with APS1 ) frequently exhibit intestinal dysfunction related to multiple etiologies including Celiac disease , autonomic neuropathy , and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency ( Du et al . , 2018 ) ; future studies will be needed to determine whether anti-RFX6 antibodies may distinguish a subset of these patients with an autoimmune enteroendocrinopathy contributing to their symptoms . While we report many novel antigens , we also acknowledge that the relationship between autoantibody status and disease is often complicated . This concept can be illustrated by examining the well-established autoantibody specificities in autoimmune diabetes ( Taplin and Barker , 2008 ) . First , islet autoantibodies ( GAD65 , ZNT8 , etc . ) can be found within non-autoimmune sera , where they are thought to represent an increased risk of developing disease as compared to the antibody-negative population . Second , not all patients with autoimmune diabetes are autoantibody positive . In sum , while autoantibodies can be extremely useful for risk assessment as well as for diagnosis , they often lack high sensitivity and specificity; both of these caveats can result in difficulties detecting strong clinical associations . For example , anti-ACP4 antibodies are highly prevalent in our cohort , but they exhibit only a trending association with dental enamel hypoplasia despite the strong biological evidence that ACP4 dysfunction leads to enamel hypoplasia ( Seymen et al . , 2016; Smith et al . , 2017 ) . Our data in humans is currently insufficient to determine whether immune responses to novel antigens such as ACP4 are pathogenic , indirectly linked to risk of disease , or instead simply represent a B-cell bystander effect . To better address these questions , we propose that future studies in mouse models could elucidate whether immune response to specific proteins , including ACP4 , can result in the proposed phenotypes . As the spectrum of diseases with potential autoimmune etiology continues to expand , the characteristic multiorgan autoimmunity in APS1 provides an ideal model system to more broadly approach the question of which proteins and cell types tend to be aberrantly targeted by the immune system . The data presented here has illuminated a collection of novel human APS1 autoimmune targets , as well as a novel antibody-disease association between RFX6 and diarrheal-type intestinal dysfunction , a highly prevalent disorder in APS1 that has until now lacked clinically applicable predictive or diagnostic markers . In sum , these data have significantly expanded the known autoantigen target profile in APS1 and highlighted several new directions for exploring the mechanics and clinical consequences of this complex syndrome . 4 Materials and methods All patient cohort data was collected and evaluated at the NIH , and all APECED/APS1 patients were enrolled in a research study protocols approved by the NIAID , NIH Clinical Center , and NCI Institutional Review Board Committee and provided with written informed consent for study participation . All NIH patients gave consent for passive use of their medical record for research purposes ( protocol #11-I-0187 ) . The majority of this cohort data was previously published by Ferre et al . ( 2016 ) and Ferré et al . ( 2019 ) . For PhIP-Seq , we adapted a custom-designed phage library consisting of 731 , 724 49AA peptides tiling the full protein-coding human genome including all isoforms ( as of 2016 ) with 25AA overlap as previously described ( O’Donovan et al . , 2018 ) . 1 milliliter of phage library was incubated with 1 microliter of human serum overnight at 4C , and human antibody ( bound to phage ) was immunoprecipitated using 40 ul of a 1:1 mix of protein A/G magnetic beads ( Thermo Fisher , Waltham , MA , #10008D and #10009D ) . Beads were washed 4 times and antibody-bound phage were eluted into 1 ml of E . coli at OD of 0 . 5–0 . 7 ( BLT5403 , EMD Millipore , Burlington , MA ) for selective amplification of eluted phage . This library was re-incubated with human serum and repeated , followed by phenol-chloroform extraction of DNA from the final phage library . DNA was barcoded and amplified ( Phusion PCR , 30 rounds ) , gel purified , and subjected to Next-Generation Sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq Instrument ( Illumina , San Diego , CA ) . Sequencing reads from fastq files were aligned to the reference oligonucleotide library and peptide counts were subsequently normalized by converting raw reads to percentage of total reads per sample . Peptide and gene-level enrichments for both APS1 and non-APS1 sera were calculated by determining the fold-change of read percentage per peptide and gene in each sample over the mean read percentage per peptide and gene in a background of mock-IP ( A/G bead only , n = 17 ) . Individual samples were considered ‘positive’ for genes where the enrichment value was 10-fold or greater as compared to mock-IP . For plotting of multiple genes in parallel ( Figures 1 and 2 ) , enrichment values were z-scored and hierarchically clustered using Pearson correlation . For comparison of distribution of PhIP-Seq gene enrichment between APS1 patients with and without specific disease manifestations , a ( non-parametric ) Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used . For radioligand binding assays , antibody index for each sample was calculated as follows: ( sample value – mean blank value ) / ( positive control antibody value – mean blank value ) . Comparison of antibody index values between non-APS1 control samples and APS1 samples was performed using a Mann-Whitney U test . Experimental samples that fell 3 standard deviations above of the mean of non-APS1 controls for each assay were considered positive , except in the case of RFX6 , where a cutoff of 6 standard deviations above the mean of non-APS1 controls was used . To determine tissue-specificity and tissue-restriction of Rfx6 expression in mice , we used publicly available Tabula Muris data ( tabula-muris . ds . czbiohub . org ) ( Schaum et al . , 2018 ) . For investigation of KHDC3L expression in human ovary , we downloaded publicly available normalized FPKM transcriptome data from human oocytes and granulosa cells ( GSE107746_Folliculogenesis_FPKM . log2 . txt ) ( Zhang et al . , 2018 ) . With this data , we performed principle component analysis , which clustered the two cell types correctly according to their corresponding sample label , and plotted log2 ( FPKM ) by color for each sample . Human kidney embryo 293T ( ATCC , Manassas , VA , #CRL-3216 , RRID:CVCL_0063 ) cells were plated at 30% density in a standard 24-well glass bottom plate in complete DMEM media ( Thermo Fisher , #119651198 ) with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum ( Thermo Fisher , #10438026 ) , 292 ug/ml L-glutamine , 100 ug/ml Streptomycin Sulfate , and 120Units/ml of Penicillin G Sodium ( Thermo Fisher , #10378016 ) . 18 hr later , cells were transiently transfected using a standard calcium chloride transfection protocol . For transfections , 0 . 1 ug of sequence-verified pCMV-insert-MYC-FLAG overexpression vectors containing either no insert ( Origene #PS100001; ‘mock’ transfection ) or RFX6 insert ( Origene #RC206174 ) were transfected into each well . 24 hr post-transfection , cells were washed in 1X PBS and fixed in 4% PFA for 10 min at room temperature . 293T cells were tested as negative for mycoplasma contamination . Fixed 293T cells were blocked for 1 hr at room temperature in 5% BSA in PBST .

Once grown in the laboratory , these cells are called naive embryonic stem cells ( ESCs ) and their discovery has been vitally important for understanding how mammals develop . ESCs also have considerable medical potential because they could be used to repair or replace tissues that have been lost to injury or disease . A family of proteins called fibroblast growth factors ( FGFs ) triggers naive ESCs to mature into another class of stem cell that are ‘primed’ to only produce particular types of cells . Curiously , the stem cells that have been collected from other mammal embryos are already in this primed state . Therefore , biologists wonder whether the naive state is exclusive to mice embryos , or whether it is present in other animals but has so far remained undetected . The development of chick and other bird embryos shares many parallels with that of mammals . However , embryos in chicken eggs do not contain naive ESCs . It is possible that this is due to chicken eggs being laid when the embryos have reached a later stage in development where the naive stem cells have already matured into the primed cells . Here , Mak et al . compared the stem cells in chick embryos to those from another bird called the zebra finch . The experiments show that the finch embryos contain stem cells that share several features with mouse ESCs . In particular , these finch cells continue to express genes that are required for the naive state to be maintained in the absence of FGF . On the other hand , these genes are switched off in cells from chick embryos and in older zebra finch stem cells . Mak et al . 's findings show that finch eggs are laid at an earlier stage of embryo development than chicken eggs . The experiments also suggest that both birds and mammals have naive pluripotent stem cells during the early stages of embryo development . In future , the zebra finch could be used as a model to study stem cells and other aspects of animal development .", "article": "1 Introduction The successful isolation and in vitro culture of embryonic stem cells ( ESC ) from mouse embryos have enabled technological breakthroughs and revolutionized our understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating mammalian development ( Evans , 2011 ) . However , similar applications to other species have been lacking . One conceptual difficulty has been linking the innate pluripotency of the embryo with the characteristics of cultured stem cells , raising the speculation that mESCs may be solely a result of in vitro manipulations ( Pauklin et al . , 2011 ) . In the mouse , ESCs are at naive state ( Nichols and Smith , 2009 ) , which recent evidence suggests is most similar to cells from embryonic day ( E ) 4–4 . 5 of mouse development ( Boroviak et al . , 2014 ) . Cells taken from this stage can give rise to derivatives of all three germ layers as well as germ cells . These cells , both in their native naive state and in culture , express genes associated with pluripotency such as Oct3/4 ( Pou5f1 ) , Sox2 , and Nanog ( 2 ) . Using defined media that includes the presence of either an inhibitor of FGF signaling or its downstream Erk/MAP kinase transduction pathway , mouse ESCs ( mESCs ) can be propagated while maintaining the expression of these pluripotency markers ( Ying et al . , 2008 ) . A second pluripotent cell type in the mouse , epiblast stem cells ( mEpiSCs ) , is derived from embryos that are later in development ( E5 . 5 ) and is in what has been termed , the primed state ( Brons et al . , 2007 ) . These cells have a more limited potency and require different culture condition for in vitro propagation ( Lanner and Rossant , 2010 ) , with a dependency on FGF-mediated ERK activation for the maintenance of pluripotent gene expression . Pluripotent ESCs from other mammalian organisms , such as human ( Thomson et al . , 1998; Schatten et al . , 2005 ) , and from non-mammalian amniotes , such as chick ( Pain et al . , 1996 ) , share this requirement for ERK signaling ( Tesar et al . , 2007 ) . Hence , the primed state of pluripotency is evolutionarily conserved in mammalian and non-mammalian amniotes . However , the naive state has so far only been confirmed in the mouse ( Ying et al . , 2008 ) and rat ( Buehr et al . , 2008; Li et al . , 2008; Chen et al . , 2013b ) , raising the possibility that this state is not conserved among the amniotes . More recent reports suggested that with specific reprogramming factors and culture conditions such a naive state may also exist for human ESCs , although the exact nature of these naive-type human cells is under debate ( Takashima et al . , 2014; Theunissen et al . , 2014; Ware et al . , 2014 ) . Identifying the naive state of embryogenesis in other species is therefore central to our conceptual understanding of pluripotent stem cells . A comparative embryology approach to address this question should include non-mammalian amniotes . These include avian species , which share key molecular and cellular features of epiblast morphogenesis with the mammals ( Sheng , 2014 ) , yet are evolutionarily distant enough to serve as an outgroup . As in all amniotes , fertilization of avian oocytes takes place internally and avian embryos undergo some development prior to egg-laying ( oviposition ) . The most widely used avian developmental models are chicken ( Gallus gallus ) , quail ( Coturnix japonica ) , and zebra finch ( Taeniopygia guttata ) . However , chicken embryos at oviposition are already at a late blastula/early gastrulation stage ( Eyal-Giladi and Kochav ( EGK ) stage X ) ( Eyal-Giladi and Kochav , 1976 ) . These embryos have a columnar epithelialized epiblast overlying scattered hypoblasts and are thus morphologically similar to E5 . 5 mouse embryo , later than the stage at which mESCs can be derived . The Japanese quail embryos are laid at a stage later than the chicken embryos ( Sellier et al . , 2006 ) , while the ovipositional stage of zebra finch embryos is unclear . Early-staged avian embryos can generate cells that show some of the characteristics of mammalian ES cells ( Jean et al . , 2015 ) after the introduction of reprogramming factors ( Rossello et al . , 2013; Dai et al . , 2014 ) or after the manipulation of culture conditions ( Pain et al . , 1996; Jean et al . , 2013 ) . However , it was not clear how the pluripotency generated be exogenous factors related to the pluripotent state of cells in the embryo . We decided to investigate the early development of the zebra finch ( hereafter referred to as the finch ) in more detail . The finches are a model system commonly used in neurobiological studies of social behavior ( Brazas and Shimizu , 2002; Svec et al . , 2009 ) , vocalization , and learning ( Jarvis , 2004; Petkov and Jarvis , 2012 ) . These studies have led to an increased focus on the developmental neurobiology of zebra finch ( Charvet and Striedter , 2009; Chen et al . , 2013a ) , and in turn the embryology of the finch ( Murray et al . , 2013 ) . In addition , the finch genome has been sequenced ( Warren et al . , 2010 ) and their relatively small adult body sizes ( 4–7 times smaller than adult chickens ) and shorter generation time ( 2–3 months for finches vs 4–6 months for the chickens ) makes it feasible to breed them within a normal laboratory setting . Thus , we asked whether finch embryos could be used for early embryogenesis and ESCs studies , complementing existing studies ( Rossello et al . , 2013 ) , which together may lead to potential technological breakthroughs that facilitate genetic and functional investigations in this model organism . Here , we report the first molecular characterization of ovipositional finch blastoderms by quantitative RT-PCR , immunohistochemical staining , and in situ hybridization . Our results suggested that finch embryos are laid at stage EGK-VI to EGK-VIII , much earlier than the chicken embryos , and are morphologically more similar to the E4–E4 . 5 mouse embryos from which mESCs can be derived . Cells derived from the finch blastoderm at oviposition and cultured in the presence of a MEK inhibitor and Leukemia inhibitory factor ( LIF ) retained expression of the pluripotent markers; Nanog , PouV expression , and alkaline phosphatase ( AP ) activity . In contrast , chicken cells taken from newly laid embryos and cultured under the same conditions did not produce Nanog , PouV , or AP-positive aggregates . Our data suggest that birds and mammals share a common regulatory mechanism in the maintenance of pluripotency . Finch embryos are ideally suited for the establishment and characterization of avian ESCs , and the incorporation of recent technical improvements ( Dai et al . , 2014 ) could lead to the finch becoming a tractable avian model for genetics and regenerative medicine . 2 Results Avian embryos undergo varying degrees of intrauterine development prior to oviposition ( egg-laying ) . Chick oviposition is at the late blastula/early gastrula stage ( EGK-X to EGK-XI ) . In other Galloanserae , oviposition ranges from EGK-VII ( Turkey [Gupta and Bakst , 1993] and Duck [Sellier et al . , 2006] ) to EGK-XI ( the quail [Stepinska and Olszanska , 1983] ) . Ratite embryos are laid at EGK-X , similar to the chick embryos ( Nagai et al . , 2011 ) . The oviposition stage of Passerine ( songbird ) species has not been carefully investigated , although gross morphology of newly laid embryos of the zebra finch and society finch ( Bengalese finch ) suggested that they are younger than EGK-X ( Yamasaki and Tonosaki , 1988; Agate et al . , 2009; Murray et al . , 2013 ) . Due to the difficulty in retrieving pre-ovipositional ( <EGK-X ) chick embryos ( Nagai et al . , 2015 ) , we decided to further explore the potential advantages of finch eggs and carried out a detailed morphological and molecular characterization of ovipositional finch embryos in order to evaluate their potential use for comparative stem cell studies as well as for genome engineering . Finch eggs are laid in intervals of between 20 and 29 hr , with most laid following a 24- to 25-hr periodicity . Based on the EGK staging system for pre-oviposition chick embryos ( Eyal-Giladi and Kochav , 1976 ) , we found that finch embryos from newly laid eggs ranged from EGK-VI to EGK-VIII , with ∼10% of eggs at EGK-VI and the rest at EGK-VII and -VIII . To probe morphological and molecular heterogeneity of the finch blastoderm , we first used section analysis of embryos stained for Hhex , a marker for endoderm cells ( Thomas et al . , 1998 ) ( Figure 1A–C ) . At EGK-VI ( early blastula ) , the embryo was composed of similar-sized blastoderm cells organized into 7–8 layers ( Figure 1A ) . The subgerminal ( blastocoel ) cavity was not as apparent as in similarly staged chick embryos ( Eyal-Giladi and Kochav , 1976; Sheng , 2014 ) . By EGK-VIII ( mid-blastula stage ) ( Figure 1B ) , the subgerminal cavity and the area pellucida became apparent and the embryo was thinner at the center of the blastoderm ( 4–5 cell-thick ) than at EGK-VI . Cells located apically , closer to the vitelline membrane ( the putative epiblast precursors ) were smaller than those located closer to the yolk side ( the putative hypoblast precursors ) . A low level of Hhex expression was detected in the hypoblast precursors . Post-ovipositional incubation of around 6 hr yielded finch embryos at EGK-X ( Figure 1C ) . At this stage , the epiblast and hypoblast were clearly separated and the epiblast showed a columnar epithelial organization . In addition , strong Hhex expression was detected in the hypoblasts . 10 . 7554/eLife . 07178 . 003Figure 1 . Morphology of the finch blastoderm at oviposition . ( A–C ) Finch embryos were sectioned after Hhex in situ hybridization to reveal the morphology of the blastoderm . At EGK-VI the blastoderm is thick , with no sign of epithelialization , and does not express Hhex ( A ) . The blastoderm is thinner at EGK-VIII but still has not overt epithelialisation , and express low level of Hhex transcripts in the cells of the yolk side ( B ) . Hhex expression can be detected clearly at EGK-X and is confined to a morphologically distinct hypoblast layer ( C ) . ( D–F ) Staining of E-cadherin reveals the extent of epithelialization of the finch blastoderm . At EGK-VI , most of the blastodermal cells appear unpolarized , however , express E-cadherin ( D ) . At EGK-VII , while thinner , the blastoderm does not show any columnar cells typical of epithelial organization ( E ) . At EGK-X , clear epithelial organization can be visualized , with polarized E-cadherin and morphological segregation in the bright-field image ( F ) . ( G , H ) ß-catenin staining confirms the lack of epithetialisation at finch oviposition stages . The pattern at EGK-VI is similar to E-cadherin staining ( G ) as is the pattern at EGK-VIII ( H ) . In A–G , scale bar represents 100 µm . ( I ) Schematic of the morphology of the early , mid , and late finch blastula: The late finch blastoderm is similar to the chick embryo at oviposition .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 07178 . 003 Epithelial organization is typically maintained by adherens junctions mediated extracellularly by homophilic interactions of E-cadherin molecules and intracellularly by adhesion complex components such as ß-catenin ( Takeichi , 2014 ) . To understand the transformation of the epithelial morphology between EGK-VI to EGK-X , we asked if there were changes to E-cadherin and ß-catenin localization consistent with epithelialization of the early embryo . At EGK-VI , both E-cadherin ( Figure 1D ) and ß-catenin ( Figure 1G ) were expressed in all cells . Staining did not appear to be enriched in any particular region of the cell and epithelialization was not apparent . By EGK-VIII , formation of an epithelial cell-sheet was not observed although the nuclei of the outermost , putative epiblast , cells appeared more regularly organized ( Figure 1E , H ) . In contrast , deep , putative hypoblast , cells appeared to down-regulate both proteins . By EGK-X , E-cadherin was up-regulated in the lateral regions of the epiblast cells ( Figure 1F ) . Their epithelial morphology was further evidenced by formation of a discrete columnar cell-sheet . Analysis of chick embryos at oviposition revealed that it was more similar to the finch embryo after incubation ( Figure 1I ) , sharing features with the finch late blastula ( Figure 1J ) . The reorganization of the blastoderm into an epithelialized epiblast and hypoblast raised the possibility that epiblast formation may be concomitant with acquisition of cell fate . The early blastoderm consists of cells fated to become the epiblast and hypoblast as well as germ cells ( Eyal-Giladi et al . , 1981; Hatada and Stern , 1994; Lawson and Schoenwolf , 2003 ) . We thus asked whether these cell identities have already been established in the finch embryo at oviposition . As oviposition ranged from EGK-VI to EGK-VIII , we examined these stages . In chick , the germ cell fate is marked by immunoreactivity to the stage-specific embryonic antigen 1 ( SSEA-1 ) and epithelial membrane antigen 1 ( EMA-1 ) antibodies ( Jung et al . , 2005 ) . In finch embryos , immunoreactivity of these proteins were observed predominantly in the epiblast precursor ( Figure 2A , B , E–H ) , with SSEA-1 staining being stronger than EMA-1 . Few hypoblast precursor cells were positive for these markers ( Figure 2C , D , E–H ) . In mouse embryos , Gata4 expression marks the specification of the hypoblast/primitive endoderm ( Soudais et al . , 1995 ) and the SoxB family member , Sox2 expression marks the epiblast precursors ( Avilion et al . , 2003 ) . In chick , a different SoxB family member , Sox3 is expressed in epiblast precursors ( Rex et al . , 1997 ) . We thus used Sox3 and Gata4 to determine the presence and distribution of these cell types in EGK-VI/VIII finch embryos . Both immunostaining and in situ hybridization confirmed that Sox3 and Gata4 could be detected at finch oviposition and that lineage segregation between these two cell types could be distinguished ( Figure 2I–K ) . Sox3 was more abundant in the cells at the vitelline membrane side ( Figure 2I , K ) and Gata4 more abundant in the yolk side ( Figure 2J , M ) . To verify the specification of the endodermal lineage , three additional markers , Gata6 , Sox17 , and Hhex , were investigated . In mouse , both Gata6 and Sox17 mark all of endodermal lineages ( Fujikura et al . , 2002; Kanai-Azuma et al . , 2002 ) . Sox17 was expressed in the hypoblast in the finch blastoderm from oviposition , with some positive cells also detected in the epiblasts ( Figure 2L ) . Expression was similar after epithelization at EGK-IX/X ( Figure 2M ) . Gata6 expression was restricted to the hypoblast lineage ( Figure 2O ) at EGK-VII/VIII , which is more apparent by EGK-X ( Figure 2P ) . Hhex expression was not detected at oviposition , but endodermal expression could be detected from mid-blastula stage ( Figure 1B , C ) . Gene expression at early- and mid-blastula stages was not associated with any overt morphological segregation at either EGK-VI or EGK-VIII . Taken together , these data suggest that the primordial germ cell , epiblast , and hypoblast precursors were already molecularly specified from early-blastula stages , prior to morphological segregation of these cell types . 10 . 7554/eLife . 07178 . 004Figure 2 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 07178 . 004 Our characterization suggested that the finch blastoderm at oviposition was equivalent to the blastocyst stage mouse embryo when the epiblast precursors had not yet polarized to form an epithelium . This is also the stage when mESCs could be derived ( Boroviak et al . , 2014 ) . In mouse embryogenesis , the naive stage is accompanied by the specific expression of a number of pluripotency-associated genes ( Nichols and Smith , 2009 ) . We thus asked whether markers of pluripotency were also expressed in the finch blastoderm at oviposition . Nanog is a transcriptional regulator involved in cell proliferation during early mouse development and in self-renewal of mESCs ( Chambers et al . , 2003; Mitsui et al . , 2003 ) . However , upon cloning finch Nanog , it became apparent that the avian Nanog locus has undergone a recent gene duplication event , producing Nanog and Nanog-like as suggested from chicken data ( Figure 3A ) ( Shin et al . , 2011 ) . Both genes showing a similar level of homology to mouse Nanog ( Figure 4B ) . Both are expressed in the early EGK-VIII finch blastoderm , predominantly in epiblast cells , but with scattered cells on the yolk side also being positive ( Figure 3C , D ) . By EGK-X , Nanog-like is differentially enriched in the periphery of the blastoderm , in cells fated for the extra-embryonic tissue ( Figure 3C ) . In contrast , Nanog is expressed throughout the epiblast of the EGK-X blastoderm ( Figure 3D ) . Two additional pluripotency regulators , PouV ( Pou5F1 , the avian homologue of Oct3/4 ) and Dnmt3b ( Calloni et al . , 2013 ) , are also expressed in finch embryos at ovipoisiton in a spatial and temporal pattern similar to that of Nanog ( Figure 3E , F ) . By EGK-X , expression of these two markers also became restricted to the epiblast . 10 . 7554/eLife . 07178 . 005Figure 3 . Expression of pluripotent markers in the finch embryo at oviposition .

Q-PCR characterization of finch and chick blastoderm at oviposition reveals fundamental molecular differences . Quantitative-PCR was used to assess the differences in gene expression between finch ( green bars ) and chick ( red bars ) embryos at oviposition . The markers used were associated with general pluripotency ( A ) , naive pluripotency ( B ) , markers of primordial germ cell development ( C ) , fibroblast growth factors ( D ) , and leukemia inhibitory factor ( LIF ) signaling ( E ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 07178 . 006 To gain a broader understanding of the molecular differences between freshly laid finch and chick embryos , we used a comprehensive Q-PCR screen to compare expression levels of a number of genes associated with early embryonic development and pluripotency . These genes have been defined from work in the mammalian species and adapted to avian species more recently . We first tested core pluripotency factors ( Figure 4 ) . Both finch and chick blastoderms at oviposition showed comparable levels of expression for many of the genes tested , namely PouV , Nanog , Dnmt3b , Sall4 , Cripto , Myc , and Sox3 . In contrast , Nanog-like , Lin28A/B and Klf2 were specifically up-regulated in the finch blastoderm . We next looked for expression of genes associated with the naive state of pluripotency . Fbxo15 and PRDM14 , which are high in naive state ES cells , are up-regulated in the finch blastoderm . The naive state genes Tbx3 and Tfcp2l1 show also higher levels of expression for the finch samples although not as prominent . Esrrb , an orphan nuclear receptor that has been used to reprogram fibroblasts into induced pluripotent stem ( iPS ) cells ( Martello et al . , 2013 ) , was not expressed in either blastoderm at oviposition . Surprisingly , Nrob1 , another gene associated with the naive state showed reciprocal expression , with high levels detected in the chick blastoderm . Interestingly , expression of above mentioned naive state associated genes could be also detected in chick blastoderm samples , albeit not as robustly as in finch samples . To clarify this , we tested additional markers to assess whether the finch blastoderm contains features of a full naive state and whether some of these features are lost in the transitional state of the chick blastoderm . The naive state of development includes cells that are able to give rise to the germ cell lineage . We thus analyzed the expression of two putative markers of germ cell fated cells , Ddx4 and Dazl . Both showed higher expression in finch blastoderms at oviposition as compared to chick . Cells derived from later , primed , staged blastoderm in mouse are dependent on FGF-mediated Erk activation . We hypothesized that the chick blastoderm at oviposition would show higher levels of FGF . Q-PCR revealed higher levels of Fgf3 , Fgf4 , and Fgf10 in the chick blastoderm as well as slightly elevated levels of Fgf8 when compared with the finch blastoderm . Fgf5 , which marks the mature epiblast and is considered to be a mEpiSC marker ( Lanner and Rossant , 2010 ) , was not detected in either chick or finch blastoderm . LIF mediates Jak-Stat3 pathway activation and has been shown to be essential for the maintenance of ESC pluripotency in the mouse ( Yoshida et al . , 1994 ) . We found that Lif and its close homologue Il6 were both expressed in finch blastoderms but showed lower levels of expression in the chick samples . Our data suggested that the expression level of naive pluripotency markers is reduced in chick blastoderms with respect to finch blastoderms at oviposition . This could be as a result of the difference in stage between these two embryos , but it is formally possible that this difference results from species differences . To exclude this , we performed Q-PCR on 2 stages of finch embryos; at oviposition and aged to the equivalent of the chick ovipositional stage , EGK-X ( Figure 5 ) . Markers of general pluripotency , that is , PouV , Nanog , and Dnmt3b show little change between ovipositional finch embryos and finch embryos at EGK-X ( Figure 5A ) . Furthermore , Nanog-like also showed only slight differences in expression levels between the two stages of finch blastoderm ( Figure 5A ) . In contrast , naive pluripotency markers , the expression levels of Fbxo15 , Prdm14 , Tbx3 , and Nrob1 showed a significant down-regulation in older finch embryos ( Figure 5B ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 07178 . 007Figure 5 . Q-PCR characterization of finch blastoderms at oviposition and aged to EGK-X . Quantitative-PCR was used to assess the differences in gene expression between finch blastoderms at laying ( green bars ) and aged to EGK-X , equivalent to chick oviposition ( blue bars ) . The markers were used to assess general pluripotency ( A ) , naive pluripotency ( B ) . p-values <0 . 05 are labeled with an asterisk . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 07178 . 007 The molecular characterization described above suggested that the behavior of isolated blastoderm cells from the chick and finch blastoderms at oviposition would be different . We hypothesized that finch blastodermal cells may act more like mESCs , whereas chick blastodermal cells would behave more similarly to mEpiSCs . An important difference between mESCs and mEpiSCs is the effect of extracellular receptor kinase ( Erk ) pathway inhibition . Naive mESCs culture is aided by blockage of Erk pathway in the presence of LIF ( Nichols and Smith , 2012 ) , whereas mEpiSCs do not . In order to test this hypothesis , individual blastoderms from finch or chick embryos at oviposition were isolated , dissociated , and cultured . Chick and finch cells that were plated and cultured without LIF and without MAP kinase inhibition formed a monolayer of cells that eventually formed aggregates . However , these aggregated colonies did not show AP activity nor did they express pluripotency-associated genes ( Nanog or PouV ) . Inclusion of LIF in the culture media had little effect on the morphological and molecular features of either chick or finch-dissociated blastodermal cells . Interestingly , when we added the MEK inhibitor together with LIF in the culture media , finch blastoderm cells formed aggregates that showed strong AP activity , as well as expressed Nanog and PouV expression ( Figure 6A–C ) . This effect was observed either in the presence or absence of GSK3ß inhibition . In contrast , while chick blastodermal cells cultured with LIF and MEK inhibitor did form aggregates , these remained negative for Nanog and PouV and did not show AP activity ( Figure 6D–F ) . We noted that some cells surrounding the chick colonies did show weak AP activity and very weak PouV expression , but these were only visible after extended staining incubation times , and were not found in colonies . 10 . 7554/eLife . 07178 . 008Figure 6 . Finch blastodermal cell cultures retain markers of pluripotency even in the presence of MEK inhibitor .

( A–C ) Finch blastodermal cells form aggregates ( red arrows ) that show alkaline phosphatase ( AP ) activity ( A ) as well as expression of PouV ( B ) and Nanog ( C ) .

Marker analysis was used to ascertain the pluripotent state of cells in each culture condition . T-tests were used to determine the significance of the difference in markers gene expression in finch ovipositional blastodermal cell culture with or without MEK inhibition . p-values <0 . 05 are labeled with an asterisk . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 07178 . 008 Q-PCR was used to compare the levels of expression of genes associated with pluripotency in the finch blastodermal cells . Three conditions were analyzed; ovipositional finch cells with or without MEK inhibitor , and finch blastoderms aged to the equivalent of HH2 , dispersed and treated with MEK inhibitor ( Figure 6G ) . Maximal expression of the naive pluripotency genes , Fbxo15 and Tbx3 , as well as the general pluripotency marker , Nanog , was seen in ovipositional finch blastodermal cells cultured with MEK inhibitor , with less expression seen in cells without MEK inhibitor and in HH2 finch blastodermal cells cultured with MEK inhibitor . These data confirm that pluripotency markers are selectively enriched in early finch blastodermal cells cultured in the presence of MEK inhibitor . Dnmt3b showed higher expression in ovipositional finch blastodermal cells without MEK inhibitor . This may indicate a second Dnmt3b-expressing cell type that is also enriched in these conditions . In mouse , Dnmt3b is initially strongly expressed in the trophectoderm ( Hirasawa and Sasaki , 2009 ) , and our initial evaluation suggests that some of the enriched cells in our cultures may be extra-embryonic . 3 Discussion The derivation of ES cells must reflect the innate pluripotency of the embryo as well as the ability to maintain this potency in vitro . Mouse data suggest that in permissive strains , ES cells can be derived from embryos at around E4–E4 . 5 of development , a stage that has been termed the naive stage of embryogenesis ( Nichols and Smith , 2009; Boroviak et al . , 2014 ) . The epiblast and hypoblast cell lineage has been specified at this stage and is dispersed throughout the inner cell mass; however , epithelialization has yet to occur ( Plusa et al . , 2008; Artus et al . , 2011 ) . We find that the finch embryo at oviposition displays similar characteristics: although the epiblast , hypoblast , and germ line are specified , these cells are dispersed throughout the multi-layered blastoderm , which has yet to epithelialize . It is likely that the sorting mechanisms that ensure segregation of germs layers are similar to those in the mouse , but would require further study . However , given the accessibility of early avian development in the finch embryo , these and other comparative studies to test hypotheses on the evolution of germ layer formation in amniotes are possible . Pluripotent gene expression in blastodermal cells derived from finch embryos is independent of the Erk pathway . This is also an important feature of mouse ES cells . In contrast , in our culture regimen , chick blastodermal cells do not retain pluripotent gene expression when cultured with an ERK pathway inhibitor , a feature of mEpiSC . Our data thus suggest that the finch blastoderm at oviposition is likely to correspond to the naive stage of embryogenesis . Furthermore , the evolutionary distance between finch and mouse suggests that the naive stage during embryogenesis is conserved amongst amniotes and that this stage likely corresponds to the pre-epithelialized epiblast in amniotes ( Figure 7 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 07178 . 009Figure 7 . Putative conservation of the naive stage during amniote embryogenesis . Similar to mouse pre-implantation embryos ( around E4 ) , prior to epiblast epithelialisation , zebra finch embryos at oviposition are at early–mid-blastula stages ( EGK-VI/VIII ) show no overt morphological segregation despite the expression of epiblast and primitive endoderm/hypoblast markers in distinct sub-populations of cells with the embryo . Cells from mouse and finch at this stage do not require ERK activation for the maintenance of pluripotent marker expression in vitro . Chick embryos at oviposition are more similar to the mouse blastula where epithelialisation has occurred . Similarly , cells from chick and mouse embryos at this stage are unable to maintain pluripotent marker expression when ERK signaling is inhibited . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 07178 . 009 The relationship between the pre-epithelialized epiblast and pluripotency is not clear . Recent data suggest that a mesenchymal to epithelial transition is important for efficient reprogramming of somatic cells into iPScells ( Li et al . , 2010; Samavarchi-Tehrani et al . , 2010 ) . Furthermore , E-cadherin , which is important in establishing epithelia , mediates LIF signaling during ES cell self-renewal ( del Valle et al . , 2013 ) . While , this does seem contrary to the notion that ES cell derivation occurs from the pre-epithelialized epiblast , we found that despite a lack of epithelialization of the newly laid finch blastoderm , E-cadherin is still highly expressed . This is similar to E-cadherin expression profile in the mouse late blastocyst ( Thomas et al . , 2004 ) . Thus , more than a mesenchymal to epithelial transition , perhaps the expression of E-cadherin represents a metastable , transitional state during mesenchymal–epithelial transition that is permissive for ES cell derivation . This also suggests that the ability to form epithelial-type adhesive contacts is present but inhibited at early/mid-blastula stages . This may be due to the presence of endogenous inhibitors of E-cadherin homophillic interactions , or alternatively it may be simply that the full repertoire of epithelial-type adhesion molecules is not yet expressed . Consistent with this is the differing adhesive properties of finch and chick blastodermal cells in culture . Chick blastodermal cells were able to adhere to a wide variety of substrates; however , optimal growth of finch blastodermal cells was only observed when type IV collagen was used as a substrate . The question then remains: how does the pluripotent characteristics of isolated cells relate to the epiblast ? One scenario could be that the epiblast consists of mixed populations of cells in varying states of pluripotency , and that the culture conditions employed can stabilize , select for , induce , or enrich for a particular state . Several lines of evidence suggest that this is the case . The use of MEK inhibition promotes the production of ES cells from the epithelialized epiblast of mouse strains that are otherwise refractory for ES cell derivation . Conversely , EpiSC cells can be isolated from the pre-epithelialized epiblast of the majority of mouse strains that do not readily produce ES cells ( Najm et al . , 2011 ) . This suggests a mixed population of cell states , and our data support this view: finch epiblast cells at oviposition likely contain sufficient numbers of naive state cells such that MEK inhibition is able to then stabilize and select for them . The situation in avians is less clear: culture conditions and exogenously introduced genes can significantly alter the pluripotency state of these cells . Transcriptional profiling suggests that chick ES cells , that are cultured in a complex but defined mix of growth factors and additives , are more similar to mouse ES cells than to mouse EpiSC , but are less similar to the chicken blastodermal cells from which they are derived ( Jean et al . , 2015 ) . Chick iPS cells also display characteristics of ES cells , with AP activity detectable in colonies in the presence of MEK inhibition . However , these observations do not suggest how induced pluripotency relates to normal early embryonic development . Our data suggest that in a minimal media , naive pluripotency in finch blastodermal cells is insensitive to MEK inhibition , whereas chick blastodermal cells require MEK for the expression of pluripotent markers , in these conditions . The challenge is to now further stabilize the naive pluripotent fate of finch blastodermal cells and in combination with recent advances in avian cell culture ( Dai et al . , 2014; Jean et al . , 2015 ) , develop this technology for understanding and manipulating avian development . 4 Materials and methods Zebra finches were maintained under a 13:11-hr light–dark cycle with constant room temperature ( RT ) at 23°C . Eggs were collected every 2 hr from the onset of the light cycle and could be stored at 17–20°C for up to 5 days without any observable drop in hatchability . Sexing of the finches was performed by PCR amplification from genomic DNA isolated from feather pulps ( Bello et al . , 2001 ) . Detailed finch husbandry protocols are available in a separate manuscript ( Mak et al . , 2015 ) . Fertile chicken eggs were purchased from Shiroyama Farm ( Kanagawa , Japan ) . Staging of the pre-primitive streak embryos followed a system previously described in the chick and are stated as Eyal-Giladi and Kochav stages ( EGK ) -I to EGK-XIV in this manuscript ( Eyal-Giladi and Kochav , 1976 ) . Hamburger and Hamilton ( HH ) system was used for embryos of streak stages and onward ( Hamburger and Hamilton , 1951 ) . Chicken blastoderms were collected with a paper ring . Finch blastoderms were micro-dissected from eggs by tungsten needles owing to their small size and yolk removed as described below . Both chick and finch blastoderms were cut out in Ringer's solution . At early stages , yolk is strongly adherent to the embryo , and the bulk of this was removed by gentle aspiration with a P1000 pipetteman . This left a layer of yolk adherent to the embryo . To remove this layer , the partially cleaned embryos were transferred to 0 . 45% D-Glucose ( Sigma , St . Louis , MO , United States ) in HBSS+ ( HBSSg ) solution and left at RT for 2 hr . After incubation , this yolk layer could be lifted from the embryo by gentle aspiration around the periphery the embryo . Embryos were then be collected and centrifuged at 400×g for 2 min . The pellet was resuspended in ED medium ( ESGRO [EMD Millipore , Billerica , MA , United States]: DMEM in 1:1 ) supplemented with Glutamax ( Gibco , Waltham , MA . , United States ) , essential amino acid ( Gibco ) , 0 . 3 mM 2-mercapthoethanol , sodium pyruvate ( 1:100 , Gibco ) , and 1% fetal calf serum . The cells were plated and grown at different culture conditions . In experiments using MEK inhibitor ( PD0325901 , Stemgent , Lexington , MA , United States ) , GSK3ß inhibitors ( CHIR99021 , Stemgent ) , the PKC inhibitor ( Gö6983 Sigma ) , and human LIF ( LIF1005 , EMD Millipore ) , half to one finch blastoderm per well of an 8-well slide chamber ( 177445 , Nunc Nalgene , Waltham , MA , United States ) was used in all experiments unless specified . 1/8 of the chick blastoderm at EGK-X was seeded in each well of an 8-well slide chamber . The growth of avian cells on a variety of substrates was also tested . Substrates tested were 0 . 1% or 0 . 25% gelatin ( G1393 , Sigma ) in PBS , collagen type I ( C2249 , Sigma ) , type IV ( C0543 , Sigma ) , type VI ( F1141 , Sigma ) , recombinant E-cadherin ( MAB1838 , R&D Systems , Minneapolis , MN , United States ) , growth factor-reduced matrigel ( 354230 , BD Biosciences , Franklin Lakes , NJ , United States ) , fibronectin ( F5022 , Sigma ) and pronectin F ( Nishishita et al . , 2012 ) ( a kind gift from Shin Kawamata , Foundation of Biomedical Research and Innovation , Kobe , Japan ) or laminin ( 354458 , BD Biosciences ) . Chicken cells grew much more robustly than finch cells and could grow on many different surface types ( 0 . 1% or 0 . 25% gelatin in PBS , collagen type I , type IV , type VI , recombinant E-cadherin , matrigel , fibronectin , pronectin F , or laminin ) . Optimal growth for chicken blastoderm cells was seen with type I and IV collagen , on which ES colony-like cell aggregates arose after 4-day culture . Optimal growth for finch blastoderm cells was obtained on human placenta type IV collagen-coated surface . We therefore used this coating for all subsequent studies . For Q-PCR analysis , cells were dissociated from the dish using 0 . 25% Trypsin-EDTA , spun down , and resuspended in lysis buffer before RNA extraction using the RNeasy Micro Kit ( Qiagen , Venlo , Netherlands ) . AP activity was detected by incubating 4% PFA fixed sections of embryos/cultured cells with 4 . 5 μl/ml NBT ( BD Bioscience ) and 3 . 5 μl/ml BCIP ( BD Bioscience ) substrates . Immunofluorescent staining was performed using standard protocols . Briefly , sections were blocked with 2% skim milk/PBST ( 0 . 1% Triton X-100 [Sigma] in PBS ) for 1 hr at RT . The primary antibody was applied on 12-to 14-μm cryosections and the slides were incubated overnight at 4°C . Primary antibodies used were: SSEA-1 and EMA-1 ( used in 1:200 , Developmental studies hybridoma bank ) , SOX3 ( Wilson et al . , 2001 ) ( in 1:300 , a gift of Sara Wilson , Umeå University , Sweden ) , GATA6 ( 1:1000 , R&D ) , E-cadherin ( 1:200 , BD Bioscience ) , and ß-catenin ( 1:200 , BD Bioscience ) . Slides were rinsed in PBST and appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa dyes were applied . The slides were incubated at RT for 4 hr . After rinsing with PBST , the nuclei of the samples were counter-stained with DAPI ( 1:4000 , Dojindo ) and mounted in Prolong Gold anti-fade reagent ( Invitrogen , Waltham MA , United States ) . Detection for the finch Vasa homologue was also attempted . Six antibodies against the chick VASA homologue ( CVH/DDX ) were tested , namely VN1 , VN2 , VC3 , and VC4 ( gifts from Bertrand Pain , unpublished ) ; anti-VASA ( Tsunekawa et al . , 2000 ) and anti-CVH ( Lambeth et al . , 2013 ) . These were used on the sections of zebra finch blastoderms and day 9 gonads , as well as the chicken day 12 gonads as a positive control . All antibodies showed good staining in positive control chicken gonad sections; however , neither finch blastoderm nor finch gonadal section showed immunoreactivity . In situ hybridization of embryos was performed using standard protocol ( Freter et al . , 2008; Alev et al . , 2013 ) . Zebra finch-specific and chicken-specific in situ riboprobe templates were generated against cDNA libraries generated by reverse transcription PCR ( SuperScript III First-strand synthesis system , Invitrogen ) from embryos of EGK-VIII , EGK-X , HH stage 4 , HH8 and HH18 ( Supplementary file 1A ) . Total RNA was isolated from either nine stage-matched newly laid or aged blastoderms of finch or two unincubated blastoderms of chick ( EGK-X ) ( triplicate for each group ) , using QIAshredder spin columns and RNeasy Micro Kit ( Qiagen ) according to manufacturer's instructions . First-strand cDNAs were synthesized in parallel from equal amounts of total RNA , using oligo ( dT ) primers and Superscript III ( Invitrogen ) . Real-time q-PCR was performed in quadruplet using Mesa Green qPCR Mastermix Plus for SYBR Assay ( Eurogentec , Seraing , Belgium ) and ABI Prism 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR system ( Applied Biosystems , Waltham MA , United States ) . Melting curve analysis was performed with SDS Software ( Applied Biosystems ) and gene expression calculated using mean cycle threshold ( Ct ) values , with normalization to finch or chick glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) , respectively . Pair-wise comparisons were tested using a t-test . Primer sequences are shown in Supplementary file 1B ."}
{"doi": "elife-21992-v3", "abstract": "Sphingosine-1-phosphate ( S1P ) is generated through phosphorylation of sphingosine by sphingosine kinases ( Sphk1 and Sphk2 ) . We show that sphk2 maternal-zygotic mutant zebrafish embryos ( sphk2MZ ) display early developmental phenotypes , including a delay in epiboly , depleted S1P levels , elevated levels of sphingosine , and resistance to sphingosine toxicity . The sphk2MZ embryos also have strikingly increased levels of maternal transcripts encoding ceramide synthase 2b ( Cers2b ) , and loss of Cers2b in sphk2MZ embryos phenocopies sphingosine toxicity . An upstream region of the cers2b promoter supports enhanced expression of a reporter gene in sphk2MZ embryos compared to wildtype embryos . Furthermore , ectopic expression of Cers2b protein itself reduces activity of the promoter , and this repression is relieved by exogenous sphingosine . Therefore , the sphk2MZ genome recognizes the lack of sphingosine kinase activity and up-regulates cers2b as a salvage pathway for sphingosine turnover . Cers2b can also function as a sphingolipid-responsive factor to mediate at least part of a feedback regulatory mechanism .", "plain language summary": "Humans and other animals need a variety of fat molecules known as lipids to survive and grow . For example , members of a large family of lipids called sphingolipids play crucial roles in many cell processes and are essential for tissues and organs to form as animal embryos develop . A molecule called sphingosine is the basic building block of most sphingolipids . An enzyme known as sphingosine kinase 2 ( Sphk2 ) converts sphingosine into a sphingolipid called sphingosine 1-phosphate , which is released from cells and regulates communication between cells . Another enzyme called ceramide synthase 2b ( Cers2b ) converts sphingosine into ceramide , which is required for the membrane surrounding individual cells to work properly . Excess levels of particular sphingolipids can be toxic to cells so animals carefully control the levels of these molecules in their bodies . However , it was not clear how animal cells sense the molecules and regulate their production and breakdown . Mendelson et al . addressed this question by studying mutant zebrafish embryos that fail to produce Sphk2 and thus produce little or no sphingosine 1-phosphate . It was thought that the mutant zebrafish may experience the toxic effects of high levels of sphingosine because they are unable to convert it to sphingosine 1-phosphate . However , the experiments show that the mutant embryos are able to avoid this toxicity by increasing the production of the Cers2b enzyme . Somehow the gene that encodes this enzyme is able to sense high levels of sphingosine and responds by increasing its own production , which in turn increases the conversion of sphingosine into the non-toxic ceramide . Further experiments found that this mechanism for sensing and removing excess sphingosine is already operating at an earlier stage of development when the zebrafish is just an egg . Further work is needed to understand exactly how this sphingosine sensing mechanism works . These findings may help us to develop new treatments for diseases caused by an imbalance in sphingolipids , such as diabetes and cancer . This work may also help to increase the success of in vitro fertilization ( IVF ) and other fertility therapies by enhancing the survival of human egg cells .", "article": "1 Introduction Sphingosine-1-phosphate ( S1P ) is a lysophospholipid mediator generated through sphingomyelin metabolism , best known as a receptor-dependent regulator of lymphocyte trafficking and vascular homeostasis . However , S1P signaling also plays key roles during embryogenesis , including developmental angiogenesis , cardiogenesis , limb development and neurogenesis ( Proia and Hla , 2015 ) . S1P binds to five G-protein-coupled receptors ( S1P1–5 ) that are widely-expressed and function either alone or together to regulate various developmental and physiological functions ( Mendelson et al . , 2014 ) . S1P can only be generated via phosphorylation of sphingosine by sphingosine kinase , encoded by two genes ( sphk1 and sphk2 ) that are highly conserved in vertebrates . In zebrafish , sphk2 is expressed during the earliest stages of embryogenesis , including as a maternal transcript ( Mendelson et al . , 2015 ) . Mouse embryos tolerate knockout of either Sphk1 or Sphk2 ( Allende et al . , 2004 ) , which implies that Sphk1 and Sphk2 function redundantly and can compensate for each other’s loss . Indeed , global or hematopoietic-specific ( erythrocyte and platelet ) knockout of both Sphk1 and Sphk2 is embryonic lethal between E11 . 5–13 . 5 due to vascular developmental defects ( Gazit et al . , 2016; Mizugishi et al . , 2005; Xiong et al . , 2014 ) that are similar to those observed in mice lacking all three receptors S1P1-3 ( Liu et al . , 2000 ) . Because of this early lethality , functions for sphingosine kinases in murine embryogenesis are otherwise not well characterized . Zebrafish genetics has contributed much of our understanding for how S1P signaling regulates collective cell migration during the process of primordial heart tube formation from two anterior lateral mesoderm progenitor fields . A point mutation in the gene miles apart ( mil ) , which encodes S1P2 , prevents cardiac precursor cells from migrating to the midline , resulting in formation of two separate defective hearts or cardia bifida ( Kupperman et al . , 2000 ) . The mutants two of hearts ( toh ) and ko157 phenocopy the mil cardiac defect and are caused by recessive mutations in the sphingolipid transporter gene , spinster2 ( spns2 ) ( Kawahara et al . , 2009; Osborne et al . , 2008 ) . A model consistent with the genetics is that spns2 functions in the yolk syncytial layer ( YSL , analogous to mammalian extra-embryonic endoderm ) to transport S1P to embryonic endoderm where it activates S1P2 signaling , coupled to Gα13 that subsequently activates RhoGEF to regulate endodermal convergence ( Ye and Lin , 2013 ) . In this way , the S1P2/Gα13/Rho pathway activates cell-surface integrins and fibronectin matrix assembly ( Zhang et al . , 1999 ) and provides endoderm with the matricellular cues recognized by myocardial precursor cells to migrate collectively towards the midline . Receptor signaling is mediated in part through YAP1-dependent expression of CTGF in S1P-activated endoderm ( Fukui et al . , 2014 ) . We ( Mendelson et al . , 2015 ) and others ( Hisano et al . , 2015a ) generated maternal zygotic mutants for sphk2 ( sphk2MZ ) and showed that these embryos phenocopy null zygotic mutants of s1pr2 and spns2 . The sphk2 transcripts can be either maternally or zygotically provided , but without either , essential migrational cues fail to be transmitted to precardiac mesoderm and formation of the heart tube fails . Sphk2 activity in the YSL , presumably acting in concert with the Spns2 transporter , establishes a gradient of extracellular S1P essential for the provision of endodermal cues that are recognized by overlapping sheets of migrating precardiac mesoderm . Endoderm convergence/heart tube formation is the earliest known developmental function for receptor-dependent S1P signaling . However , the studies do not rule out other receptor-independent functions for Sphk2 . We have since re-evaluated the sphk2MZ embryos and discovered phenotypes that are distinct from those found by disruption of spns2 or s1pr2 . These phenotypes appear to be caused not by loss of S1P , but rather by the excessive accumulation of the precursor substrate sphingosine in the absence of kinase . This led us to the discovery that embryos lacking sphingosine kinase activity tolerate the potentially toxic excess sphingosine because they upregulate a specific ceramide synthase ( Cers ) gene , as a salvage pathway to normalize sphingosine levels . We mapped a DNA region that mediates the transcriptional response on the cers2b promoter . It has long been noted that Cers enzymes , in addition to encoding a Lag motif important for enzymatic activity that metabolizes sphingosine to ceramide , also encode a homeobox domain , typically used for DNA-binding by the HOX class of transcription factors ( Levy and Futerman , 2010 ) . Indeed , we show that Cers2b , probably by an indirect mechanism , can modulate the expression of its own promoter , and this activity requires the HOX domain and is sensitive to sphingosine levels . Our study identifies cis-linked sphingolipid transcriptional response sequences , and reveals a sensing mechanism controlling sphingolipid levels by a metabolic enzyme that participates in a feedback program . 2 Results Upon close examination of developing embryos , we noticed that sphk2MZ embryos display a subtle but consistent developmental delay during gastrulation , compared to time-matched wildtype embryos , particularly obvious around 7–8 hr post fertilization ( hpf ) ( Figure 1A–D ) . The developmental delay observed in sphk2MZ embryos was recapitulated in wildtype embryos treated with 3 μM sphingosine ( Figure 1E , F ) . In contrast , wildtype embryos were unaffected by culturing in the presence of ceramide ( 20 μM ) , S1P ( 20 μM ) , or N-acetyl-D-sphingosine ( 20 μM ) ( Figure 1G–I ) . Quantitative lipidomics profiling confirmed that the mutant embryos are depleted of S1P to essentially undetectable levels . However , this analysis also revealed that the mutant embryos have excessive levels of sphingosine and total long chain ceramides ( Figure 1J , K ) , likely due to substrate backup caused by lack of sphingosine kinase and reverse reactions that form ceramide . These observations indicate that in the absence of Sphk2 , embryos accumulate excessive levels of the precursor substrate sphingosine , associated with a developmental delay during gastrulation . This is however ultimately tolerated by embryos , and they recover , until displaying later phenotypes in endoderm convergence and heart formation . Although sphk2MZ mutant embryos accumulate sphingosine and display developmental delay , we discovered that they are relatively resistant to exogenous sphingosine-induced toxicity . Treatment of wildtype embryos with 5 μM D-erythro-sphingosine ( the active naturally occurring isomer ) or 5 μM L-erythro-sphingosine ( an inactive isomer ) caused developmental collapse during epiboly , a stage of collective cell migration of epiblast cells during gastrulation . At around 50–60% epiboly , in 100% of the treated embryos , epiboly arrests , the epiblast pinches off the yolk cell , and the yolk membrane ruptures , leading to embryonic lethality ( Figure 2A–C ) . Treatment with sphingosine analogues ( psychosine , dimethylsphingosine , and safingol ) recapitulated this epiboly phenotype ( Figure 2D–F ) . Treatment with two chemical inhibitors of sphingosine kinases , SKI ( 10 μM ) or BT-190 ( 3 μM ) also recapitulated the same embryonic lethal phenotype ( Figure 2G , H ) . In contrast , sphk2MZ embryos given the same treatments do not fail epiboly and ( other than mild delay ) develop normally ( Figure 2I ) until they display later endoderm/cardiac defects . Therefore , accumulation of sphingosine above a certain threshold is normally incompatible with embryonic development , yet tolerated in sphk2MZ mutant embryos . The developing zebrafish blastula is comprised of three cell layers: an extra-embryonic transient epithelial monolayer known as the enveloping layer ( EVL ) , an extra-embryonic yolk syncytial layer ( YSL ) , and the deep cells of the blastoderm that will eventually form the embryo proper . During early gastrulation , the blastoderm and the YSL move toward the vegetal pole during a process known as epiboly . A microtubule network surrounds the yolk syncytial nuclei while another set of animal–vegetal-oriented microtubules emerge from the YSL into the yolk cytoplasmic layer ( YCL ) . As epiboly progresses , two actin rings become visible; these rings serve to close the developing blastopore . Proper cytoskeletal patterning is crucial during epiboly as chemical disruption of either the microtubule or actin networks blocks epiboly progression ( Solnica-Krezel , 2006 ) . To gain insight into why embryos treated with excessive sphingosine or with sphingosine kinase inhibitors fail to complete epiboly , we stained treated embryos to evaluate cytoskeletal markers associated with morphological defects . Compared to control embryos , those embryos treated with 5 μM sphingosine , 3 μM BT-190 , or 10 μM SKI when stained with phalloidin show delayed progression with aggregation of thick F-actin positive bundles within the YCL ( Figure 3A–D ) as well as accumulation of F-actin within the cytoplasm of the EVL cells ( Figure 3E–H ) . When control ( DMSO-treated ) embryos were at 50% epiboly , the treated embryos ranged typically from 25–40% epiboly . These thick actin bundles may cause abnormal contractile forces that disrupt the YCL; alternatively , these forces may create resistance to vegetal pulling of the EVL . Staining with an antibody against α-tubulin revealed a thickened microtubule layer within the YSL as well as microtubule aggregation in certain areas of the YCL and other areas that are completely devoid of microtubules ( Figure 3I–N ) . Note that the progression of the EVL appears to be more delayed compared to the deep cell layer ( indicated by brackets in panels I-K ) . E-cadherin staining shows reduced localization at EVL cell membrane junctions and accumulation of staining within the EVL cytoplasm in embryos treated with 5 μM sphingosine or 3 μM BT-190 , compared to DMSO-treated control embryos ( Figure 3O–Q ) . The sphk2MZ embryos display elevated sphingosine and ceramide levels , yet are relatively resistant to gastrulation defects caused by excess sphingosine , suggesting that they employ a sphingosine kinase-independent mechanism to handle substrate accumulation . We hypothesized that sphk2MZ embryos might regulate one or more genes encoding enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of sphingosine from ceramide ( ceramidases ) or conversion of sphingosine into ceramide ( ceramide synthase ) . Therefore we examined expression levels for all the ceramide synthase and ceramidase genes that are annotated in the zebrafish genome ( some of which are duplicated ) . This analysis showed only one gene , cers2b , that is significantly and strikingly upregulated in sphk2MZ embryos compared to wildtype embryos ( Figure 4A ) . This suggests that sphk2MZ embryos up-regulate a salvage pathway for sphingosine turnover through a specific ceramide synthase gene , cers2b , which could potentially protect these embryos from sphingosine-mediated gastrulation defects . Thus , we hypothesized that knockdown of Cers2b in sphk2MZ embryos should recapitulate the gastrulation phenotype observed following treatment of wildtype embryos with sphingosine . Knockdown experiments were performed using a translation blocking morpholino ( MO ) against cers2b . Because MOs can have off-target or toxicity effects , the MO was titrated to define reagent amounts , e . g . 5 ng , having no effect following injection into wildtype embryos . Injection of the same amount of cers2b MO into sphk2MZ embryos resulted in a phenocopy of the sphingosine-induced toxicity defect during early gastrulation in 60/288 ( 21% ) embryos from four independent experiments , with failure of epiboly and pinching of the blastoderm from the yolk cell ( Figure 4B , C , p=0 . 015 ) . This suggests that transcriptional up-regulation of cers2b is important for sphk2MZ embryos to resist the buildup of excessive sphingosine and complete epiboly . It is perhaps not surprising that the morphant phenotype is not fully penetrant since morphant knockdowns may be partial or transient . They may also be subject to off-targeting . Therefore , to more rigorously test whether Cers2b compensates for loss of Sphk2 to relieve excess sphingosine , we designed sgRNAs to target mutation of cers2b . We established a line of fish carrying a 23 bp deletion in exon6 of the cers2b gene that is predicted to delete most of the Lag domain and generate a frame-shift with a premature stop codon and a truncated protein that would lack enzymatic function . This mutant allele was tolerated for development and was crossed onto the background of the sphk2 mutant , to raise sphk2MZ; cers2b+/- adult fish . When crossed to each other , the resulting clutches consistently had approximately 25% of the embryos that phenocopied the gastrulation defect caused by treating wildtype embryos with excess sphingosine ( Figure 4D ) . These embryos rapidly perish , which precluded our ability to measure directly the ceramide levels or genotype the dying embryos . However , the genetic interaction of sphk2 and cers2b is fully consistent with sphingosine-associated up-regulation and compensation from Cers2b . We note that the cers2b gene fails to be up-regulated in the sphk2 morphants ( Figure 4E ) , and neither do these embryos show increased ceramide levels ( Figure 4F ) . Likewise , wildtype embryos treated with sphingosine fail to activate expression of cers2b ( Figure 4G ) or to significantly increase levels of total ceramides ( Figure 4H ) . We crossed sphk2+/- females with either wildtype males or mutant null males , to compare the relative levels of cers2b transcripts or sphingosine . In the former case , the embryos are 50% heterozygous and 50% wildtype ( none are null ) , while in the latter case 50% of the embryos are zygotic null ( and the other 50% are heterozygous ) . If the sphk2 zygotic null mutants were similar to sphk2MZ mutants , we would expect to measure half the levels of increased sphingosine in this latter cohort compared to what is measured in the sphk2MZ mutants . However , we found the levels were not increased compared to the control cohort and neither were overall S1P levels depleted ( Figure 4I ) . Therefore , the data suggest that the increased sphingosine level associated with transcriptional activation of cers2b is dependent on the maternal loss of Sphk2 function , and neither wildtype embryos nor morphants are able to respond to increased sphingosine levels by up-regulation of the cers2b gene . The strikingly higher cers2b transcript levels in sphk2MZ embryos suggest that this gene may have cis-regulatory elements that respond to sphingosine levels ( sphingosine response elements ) . If true , these elements might confer promoter activity to a reporter gene , which like the endogenous gene should be more active in sphk2MZ embryos compared to wildtype embryos . The cers2b gene is located on chromosome 16 , with a transcriptional start site approximately 1 . 7 kb downstream of the 3’ end of the adjacent celf3b gene . The putative promoter region of cers2b , including the entire 1680 bp non-coding region directly upstream of exon1 was isolated by PCR and cloned upstream of a firefly luciferase reporter gene . This construct was co-injected with RNA encoding a control renilla luciferase enzyme into fertilized eggs of wildtype or sphk2MZ embryos . In three independent experiments using a total of 114 embryos of each genotype per experiment ( n = 38 samples , each sample comprised from three embryos ) the ratio between firefly luciferase to renilla luciferase ( FL/RL ) was 9-fold higher in sphk2MZ embryos compared to wildtype embryos ( Figure 5A , p<0 . 0001 ) . We note that this difference was entirely attributable to the luciferase reporter , as the control RL levels were highly consistent in all experiments . To localize the sequences of the cers2b promoter that mediate this response , shorter promoter fragments were cloned into the reporter , progressively deleting 5’-upstream sequences , and compared for activity in wildtype and mutant embryos . The results of this study are also shown in Figure 5A . Deletion of the first 49 bp ( 1631 bp construct ) decreased the enhanced responsiveness to 6-fold , while deletion of 83 bp ( 1597 bp construct ) reduced it to a 2-fold difference . Deletion of the upsteam 400 bp ( 1281 bp construct ) essentially eliminated promoter activity in both wildtype and mutant embryos . These results indicate that key regulatory regions conferring both promoter activity and enhanced response in sphk2MZ mutant embryos are present in the 400 bp region at the 5’ end of the 1 . 7 kb promoter construct . Indeed , when this 400 bp fragment was cloned upstream of an independent minimal SV40 promoter , although the basal activity was somewhat lower , the resulting construct fully recapitulates a 9-fold enhanced activity in sphk2MZ embryos compared to wildtype ( Figures 5A and 400 bp ) . The ability of mutant embryos to enhance expression of cers2b in sphk2MZ embryos indicates a sensing mechanism to engage this alternative metabolic pathway and resist toxicity caused by excess sphingosine . An attractive candidate component of this sensing mechanism would be Cers2b itself , since it is the ideal protein for recognizing sphingosine and thereby might be differentially impacted depending on sphingosine levels . We were struck by the additional observation that many vertebrate ceramide synthase enzymes , including Cers2b , encode not only metabolic activity domains , but also a homeobox domain , typically found in homeobox class transcription factors . This raises the possibility that Cers2b , in addition to functioning to sense sphingosine levels , could potentially impact the transcriptional activity of its own or other genes . To test if Cers2b can impact expression of its own promoter , the luciferase reporter under control of cers2b upstream sequences was co-transfected into HEK293T cells with an expression vector for Cers2b or a control empty expression vector , along with a control renilla luciferase expression vector to normalize for transfection efficiency and lysate preparation . Expression of Cers2b consistently and significantly decreased expression of the cers2b:luciferase reporter ( Figure 5B ) , indicating that Cer2b can be a functional repressor of its own gene . Addition of 10 μM sphingosine to the transfected cells relieved this repressor activity so that the reporter was expressed at levels not significantly different from the control conditions without Cers2b . To test if this activity was dependent on the homeobox domain , a two amino acid mutation was introduced into the Cers2b coding sequence ( R121W , R122S ) , which is predicted to impair the conserved structure of the homeodomain ( Banerjee-Basu and Baxevanis , 2001 ) . Like addition of sphingosine , the RR121-122WS alteration eliminated the capacity for Cers2b to repress its own promoter ( Figure 5B ) . We also generated by site-directed mutagenesis an isoform for Cers2b that is mutant in the Lag domain ( HH212-213DD ) . This isoform is predicted to be enzymatically dead , and so we compared the effect of this protein to the wildtype protein and the isoform with a mutant HOX domain for Cers2 promoter regulation . As shown Figure 5B , The Lag-mutant protein retains the ability to repress the reporter controlled by the cers2b promoter . Compared to the wildtype protein , the Lag-mutant fails to generate ceramide above background levels ( Figure 5C ) . In contrast , the HOX mutant protein retains the ability , equivalent to the wildtype protein , to increase ceramide levels , but is unable to repress activity of the promoter . Therefore , the HOX domain is required for cers2 gene regulation , independent of enzymatic function . Since forced expression of Cers2b can repress its own promoter , dependent on the HOX domain , we considered the possibility that Cers2b might be able to function directly as a transcription factor . In this case , it would be expected that some fraction of the protein is localized in the nucleus to interact with its own promoter or other genes . We used confocal microscopy of HEK293T cells transfected with a vector to express a Cers2-GFP fusion protein , in order to visualize localization in live cells ( Figure 6A ) . As expected , Cers2-GFP protein is localized primarily to the ER , throughout the cell including contiguous to the nuclear membrane . Following exposure to 10 μM sphingosine , a condition that leads to de-repression of the reporter that is regulated by the cers2b promoter , there is a considerable change in the distribution of the fusion protein and notably enhanced signal associated with the nuclear membrane . There did not appear to be significant levels of the fusion protein in the nucleus either at steady state or following sphingosine exposure . We also compared expression levels of the protein by western blotting , following separation of nuclear and cytosolic extracts . In this case there was a marked enrichment for Cers2b in the nuclear fraction following exposure to sphingosine ( Figure 6B ) . However , when the nuclear fraction was further separated , we found that sphingosine induction caused Cers2b association primarily with nuclear membranes ( Figure 6C ) , consistent with the confocal imaging . Therefore , we did not find evidence that Cers2 functions as a nuclear protein and while function as a transcription factor can’t be ruled out , it appears more likely that Cers2b impacts promoter activity by an indirect mechanism , perhaps acting at the nuclear membrane to process nuclear sphingosine . Given the early activation of Cers2b in the sphk2MZ embryos , we hypothesized that this could represent a protective mechanism to remove excess sphingosine during oogenesis . In this case , we would expect that sphingosine levels would be relatively high and the cers2b gene already activated even in mutant oocytes . Lipidomics comparing wildtype and sphk2 mutant oocytes confirmed , similar to the sphk2MZ embryos , a lack of S1P and relatively higher levels of sphingosine in the mutant oocytes ( Figure 7A ) , although in this case the total ceramide levels were not significantly different ( Figure 7B ) . We also carried out in situ hybridization experiments probing oocytes derived from ovaries of sphk2 mutant females . This confirmed strikingly higher levels of cers2b transcripts in the mutant oocytes compared to wildtype ( Figure 7C ) . Furthermore , early embryos derived from a sphk2 null female are resistant to rupture when exposed to exogenous sphingosine , despite a functional sphk2 allele inherited from the wildtype male ( Figure 7D ) . All the data are fully consistent with a sphingosine-induced Cers2b-based protective mechanism during oogenesis . 3 Discussion S1P signaling has great capacity to impact embryonic development through complex receptor-dependent G-protein coupled pathways that cross-talk with each other and additional developmental signaling programs . It is less appreciated that regulation of sphingolipid metabolism may have additional receptor-independent functions equally critical for early developmental decisions such as cell proliferation , survival , and tissue morphogenesis . Previous studies confirmed that Sphk2 is an enzyme required to generate S1P used during early embryogenesis in an S1P receptor-dependent manner to regulate endoderm convergence and heart tube formation ( Hisano et al . , 2015a; Mendelson et al . , 2015 ) . Here we confirmed that sphk2MZ mutant embryos are depleted of S1P , but we also found additional previously unrecognized phenotypes that result from dysregulation of sphingolipid metabolism . Importantly , the mechanistic underpinnings of this phenotype revealed a previously unknown regulatory mechanism by which sphingolipid metabolism is achieved at the level of ceramide production . The sphk2MZ mutant embryos have increased sphingosine levels due to the failure to convert this substrate to S1P . These embryos are developmentally delayed during gastrulation , although they eventually recover and can complete epiboly . This delay can be phenocopied in wildtype embryos by culturing in the presence of excess sphingosine , suggesting that the two observations are linked . Even with the increased sphingosine levels , the mutant embryos are nevertheless relatively resistant to toxicity caused by excess sphingosine . This indicates that they have engaged an alternative program to convert sphingosine to a non-toxic metabolite . The mutant embryos express strikingly high levels of cers2b transcripts , strong evidence for this anticipated salvage pathway for sphingosine turnover . Knockdown and genetic interaction experiments suggest that transcriptional up-regulation of cers2b is important for mutant embryos to complete epiboly . Finally , cers2b promoter activity can be transferred to an independent reporter gene , functioning in cis to promote higher expression levels in sphk2MZ embryos compared to wildtype embryos . Upstream sequences confer sphingosine responsivity , located within a 400 bp region . Cers2b protein itself can partially repress activity of this promoter , dependent on a HOX domain but independent of enzymatic activity , and this repression is relieved by addition of sphingosine . These findings reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism by which the genome senses and modulates sphingosine levels during embryogenesis . The reason that Sphk2MZ embryos are delayed in epiboly is not known , but we speculate that it is caused by destabilization of the actin-microtubule cytoskeletal network due to accumulation of excess sphingosine . A similar delay is recapitulated in wildtype embryos treated with 3 μM sphingosine , while increasing this to 5 μM causes rupture of the epiblast associated with massive disorganization of actin and microtubule networks that are essential for ‘pulling’ the blastoderm around the yolk cell . Upregulation of cers2b in the mutant embryos manages to maintain sphingosine levels below this ‘catastrophic’ threshold , generating a phenotype similar to wildtype embryos treated with the 3 μM lower dose . A good candidate for mediating the connection to cytoskeleton is the p21-activated kinase Pak1 . Pak kinases can localize to cortical actin structures , and expression of activated mutants induces cytoskeletal reorganization , including loss of actin stress fibers ( Manser et al . , 1997 ) . Pak1 signaling is also implicated during epiboly in sustaining E-cadherin at adherens junctions ( Tay et al . , 2010 ) , which also fails in the sphingosine-treated embryos . Interestingly , sphingosine was shown previously to activate PAK1 in mammalian cells in a concentration-dependent manner ( Bokoch et al . , 1998 ) . The dramatic blastoderm constriction phenotype is remarkably similar to the maternal-zygotic betty boop ( bbp ) mutant embryo ( Holloway et al . , 2009 ) , suggesting that it could also involve defects in a p38/MAPKAPK2 pathway . Although S1P2 couples through Gα13 to control cell migration ( Ye and Lin , 2013 ) , and Gα13 signaling plays an important role in epiboly progression ( Solnica-Krezel , 2006 ) , the receptor-dependent pathway seems less likely to be involved , since similar phenotypes are not observed in embryos lacking S1P receptors ( Hisano et al . , 2015b ) . On the other hand , it has long been recognized that while Sphk1 is localized primarily in the cytoplasm , Sphk2 is mostly a nuclear protein , and may be particularly important for regulating nuclear sphingosine levels , which could impact DNA synthesis ( Igarashi et al . , 2003 ) or oxidative stress otherwise leading to DNA damage and apoptosis ( Van Brocklyn and Williams , 2012 ) . We note that sphk2 is expressed as a maternal transcript , and this is also true of cers2b in the sphk2MZ mutant embryos . This suggests that the genome might be especially vigilant at limiting nuclear sphingosine levels during oogenesis in order to protect genomic integrity . In this context , it is of interest to note previous studies where sphingolipids , particularly S1P , were shown to protect oocytes from apoptosis induced by genotoxic stress or chemotherapy in mice and primates ( Morita et al . , 2000 ) . S1P treatment in vitro was shown to induce oocyte survival ( Hannoun et al . , 2010 ) , and acid ceramidase is known to modulate oocyte apoptosis ( Eliyahu et al . , 2010 ) . Thus , our findings could have practical implications in reproductive sciences and in vitro fertilization technology . It is interesting that Cers2b contains a homeobox domain , required for repressing transcriptional activity of its own promoter . This leads to a model whereby under conditions with limiting sphingosine levels the Cers2b enzyme functions to repress its own gene and thereby limit sphingosine conversion to ceramide ( perhaps also favoring conversion to S1P ) . If sphingosine levels exceed a certain threshold , for example by loss of Sphk2 activity and/or increased ceramidase activity , this is recognized by binding of sphingosine to the Lag domain of Cers2b , which relieves Cers2b repression activity , perhaps through a conformational alteration , and activates enzymatic activity to remove sphingosine by metabolism to ceramide . Currently we can’t rule out post-transcriptional regulation of the cers2b gene in response to increased sphingosine levels . However , we note that the cers2b transcript levels are markedly enhanced , at levels that are recapitulated by the promoter using a luciferase reporter with no shared RNA sequences . Furthermore , the increase is highly specific to the cers2b transcript . 15 years ago Venkataraman and Futerman speculated whether the presence of a homeobox domain suggests that the enzymes might act as dual sphingosine sensors and transcriptional regulators , analogous to how sterol regulatory element binding protein ( SREBP ) senses and modulates sterols ( Venkataraman and Futerman , 2002 ) . Consistent with our results , overexpressing mammalian Cers2 in HT29 colon cancer cells caused a modest but significant reduction in transcription of a reporter gene regulated by an acid ceramidase promoter ( Tirodkar et al . , 2015 ) , suggesting that Cers2 might have additional pathway-relevant targets . The single Drosophila Cers ortholog , Schlank , also has a homeodomain , in addition to the Lag motif . Interestingly , schlank mutants could be rescued by expression of variant proteins lacking a functional Lag motif , as long as they contained the homeodomain and a nuclear localization signal ( Voelzmann et al . , 2016 ) . While the mechanism for Cers2b action during zebrafish embryogenesis remains unclear , our results suggest the critical role played by this ER/nuclear membrane-localized enzyme is in autoregulation of sphingolipid metabolism . Our data provide new evidence for a role of ceramide synthase in vertebrate embryonic development , but the concept of a dual role in metabolism and transcription has been considered previously . In fact , together with our observations , it seems likely that Cers2b may play a central role in coordinating a response following sensing of sphingosine levels to the transcriptional machinery in the regulation of sphingolipid metabolism . Our observation linking Cers2b to genomic sensing/transcription was only made possible by close examination of subtle phenotypes in the sphk2MZ mutant embryo . The identical phenotype caused by excess sphingosine in wildtype embryos ( pinching off of the blastoderm during epiboly and embryonic lethality ) was also seen in sphk2 morphants . This suggests that mutants ( but not morphants or wildtype embryos treated with sphingosine ) are able to recognize the defect and have time to take corrective action through engaging the salvage Cers2 pathway . The process apparently occurs during oogenesis , since it involves the expression of maternal transcripts . The capacity of zebrafish embryos to compensate for mutant genes may be relatively robust ( see also [Rossi et al . , 2015] ) , and at least partially responsible for the reported disparity between mutant and morphant phenotypes ( Kok et al . , 2015 ) . It can also be fortuitous for revealing novel biological regulatory mechanisms . 4 Materials and methods Wildtype ( AB/TU hybrid ) and mutant zebrafish were maintained at 28 . 5C and staged as described ( Kimmel et al . , 1995 ) . Sphk2MZ were generated ( sphk2wcm2 ) and characterized as described previously ( Mendelson et al . , 2015 ) . To generate a cers2b mutant line , a sgRNA was designed using CHOPCHOP ( https://chopchop . rc . fas . harvard . edu ) to target the 20 bp sequence AGTACCAGTACTGAGACGGC in exon6 within the Lag domain of the cers2b gene . The sgRNA was synthesized using 125 ng gblock ( IDT ) and transcribed in vitro using the MegaShortScript T7 kit ( ThermoFisher , Waltham , MA ) . 150 pg RNA was injected into fertilized eggs with 250 pg recombinant Cas9 protein ( Pnabio ) in a volume of 2 nl per injection . F0 founder fish transmitting mutant alleles were identified using T7 exonuclease assays and F1 embryos raised to adulthood . One line was established ( cers2bwcm18 ) that transmits a 23 bp deletion allele , with loss of the nucleotide sequence GTCTCAGTACTGGTACTACATGC , causing a frameshift that deletes Cers2b starting at amino acid S178 , generating a mutant protein encoding subsequently: YDLEEMWKGFPTLTLLPAGTGLLHLSPVQCGVGRQAQGL* . Staged embryos were homogenized with TRIzol ( Ambion ) and total RNA was isolated ( Qiagen ) . Total RNA ( 1 μg ) was used to generate cDNA using reverse transcriptase and random hexamers ( Roche ) . LightCycler 480 SYBR Green 1 Master Mix ( Roche ) was used to analyze cDNA by quantitative RT-PCR using the Light Cycler 480II ( Roche ) . The PCR cycle conditions were 95C for 15 min followed by 40 cycles at 94C for 14 s , 54°C for 30 s , and 72°C for 30 s . Ct values were calculated using the ΔΔCt method ( Livak and Schmittgen , 2001 ) , based on the median value from a triplicate set . Each value was normalized to levels of 18S transcripts . Statistical significance was determined using a two-tailed Student’s t-test . Primer sequences were designed using Primer3 and were: cers1 FOR: 5’-ACATGGACGAATGGAGGAAG REV: 5’-CGAGAATGCCTATGTTGTGG cers2a FOR: 5’-AACCAAGAGCGACCAAACC REV: 5’-CCAGCAATGAAAGCAACAAG cers2b FOR: 5’-CGCAGAAATCAAGACAGACC REV: 5’-AGCAAGACCACCGATGAAG cers3a FOR: 5’-TCAGGAGGAGACGAAACCAG REV: 5’-CCTCCAATGAATGCCAACAG cers3b FOR: 5’-TGTAAAAAGCTGGGCTGGTC REV: 5’-CTCCTCCAAAAGTCGAGCAC cers4a FOR: 5’-CAAACTGGAGGCGTTCTACC REV: 5’-AGCCATGACTGAATCTGACG cers4b FOR: 5’-GAAACCGCAGAAATCTGGAC REV: 5’-ACCAGGTAGAAGGCAAACCTC cers5 FOR: 5’-ACAAACCCAGCACAAGAACC REV: 5’-CAGAAAACGCATCCCATACG cers6 FOR: 5’-AATCCAACGCTGGTTCAGAC REV: 5’-TTCTTCAGGAAGCGCACAC asah1a FOR: 5’-TATGTTGGCATGCTCACTGG REV: 5’-CCCATCAAAGTCAAAGCGTTC asah1b: FOR: 5’-CATGATTCAGGCCATCAGAG REV: 5’-GGCAGAGTGTCCACCATTAAC asah2: FOR: 5’-TAAGAGAGTCGTGTTCGTCACC REV: 5’-TCCTGAATGTGTGTGTGTGC acer1 FOR: 5’-CAAACACTTCCCTTCCTTCG REV: 5’AGGCATTGGCTGTAGGTTTG acer2 FOR: 5’-GTGGTTTCCCAAGAGATACCTG REV: 5’-TGGAGTTTATCGCTGGCTTG acer3 FOR: 5’-ATCTACAGCTGCTGCGTCTTTG REV: 5’-AATAGTTAACGGCACGCTCTTG Wildtype and sphk2MZ zebrafish embryos were obtained at the one cell stage from paired adults , cultured in system water until 2 hpf and then grouped into individual 60 mm petri dishes , each containing 35 embryos in 10 mL of 1x E3 buffer , 1% DMSO , and 1 mM Tris pH 7 . 5 . Compounds were diluted in DMSO to 10 mM stocks , and added to the cultured embryos to a final concentration of: 5 μM D-erythro-sphingosine C18 chain ( Avanti ) , 5 μM L-erythro-sphingosine C18 chain ( Matreya ) , 5 μM D-galactosyl-ß1–1'-D-erythro-sphingosine ( Psychosine ) ( Avanti ) , 10 μM dimethylsphingosine ( DMS ) ( Tocris ) , 20 μM L-threo-Dihydrosphingosine ( Safingol ) ( Avanti ) , 20 μM C8 ceramide ( Enzo Life Sciences ) , 20 μM spingosine-1-phosphate ( d18:1 ) ( S1P ) ( Avanti ) , 20 μM N-acetyl-D-sphingosine ( Sigma ) , 10 μM sphingosine kinase inhibitor 2 ( SKI , Cayman Chemicals ) , or 3 μM BT-190 . BT-190 compound is identical to RB-046 and was synthesized as described ( Baek et al . , 2013 ) . For these experiments the shorter chain ceramides were used because they can be dissolved and accurately measured . In contrast , long-chain ceramides are extraordinarily difficult to manipulate in vitro due to hydrophobicity making it difficult to accurately define the exposure level of phospholipid . The morphology of developing embryos was scored at 6 hpf . A translation blocking morpholino oligomer ( MO ) was designed to target the 5’ UTR around the start codon of Cers2b to block mRNA translation ( 5’-CTCGCTCAGACCCGCCAGCATTTCA ) and was purchased from Gene Tools ( Philomath , OR ) . Blast analysis indicated the MO is specific for cers2b ( no overlap with other sequences ) . All morphants were compared to stage matched embryos that were injected with the same concentrations of a standard control morpholino ( Gene Tools ) . Each MO was titrated by injection into 1–4 cell fertilized embryos to determine a minimal dose for the reproducible phenotype . Neither the control or cers2b-specific MO disrupted normal development of wildtype embryos . Microinjection of MOs was performed using a PLI-100 Pico-Injector ( Harvard Apparatus ) . Fifty zebrafish embryos were dechorionated using protease for 5 min and washed using E3 solution . The pellets were centrifuged for 2 min and the supernatants removed . The samples were submitted to the analytical core facilities at Stonybrook University or the Medical University of South Carolina for ceramide and sphingolipid analysis . Sphingolipids were extracted after the addition of internal standards and quantified by LC/MS/MS as described previously ( Mendelson et al . , 2013 ) . Embryos were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4C . Following two washes for 5 min each in PBSTw ( PBS + 0 . 1% Tween-20 ) , embryos were manually dechorionated . To permeabilize , embryos were incubated for 2 hr in PBS + 2% Triton X100 . Following two washes for 5 min each in PBSTw , embryos were blocked for 1 hr with 2% BSA in PBSTw . Embryos were incubated for 2 hr at RT in Alexa 546 phalloidin ( Invitrogen ) diluted 1:40 in 2%BSA/PBSTw . Following 6 washes for 10 min each in PBSTw , embryos were mounted in agarose for confocal microscopy . Following fixation in microtubule stabilizing buffer [MSB] at RT for 2 hr , embryos were rinsed briefly in PBSTw and dechorionated . MSB composition is 80 mM KPIPES ( pH6 . 5 ) , 5 mM EGTA , 1 mM MgCl2 , 3 . 7% formalin , 0 . 25% gluteraldehyde , and 0 . 2% Triton . Embryos were blocked in 10% Normal Goat Serum ( Vector Labs ) in PBSTw for 30 min and then incubated with monoclonal anti-α-tubulin ( 1:500 ) ( clone DM1A ) diluted in blocking reagent overnight at 4C . Following four washes in PBSTw , the embryos were incubated in Alexa 568 goat anti mouse IgG ( Invitrogen ) ( 1:500 ) diluted in blocking reagent for 2 hr at RT and then rinsed four times for 20 min each in PBSTw prior to mounting in agarose and confocal imaging . Embryos were fixed with 4% PFA in PEMTT ( 0 . 1 M PIPES , 5 mM EGTA , 2 mM MgCl2 · 6H2O , 0 . 1% TritonX-100 , 0 . 1% Tween 20 , pH 6 . 8 ) overnight . Embryos were then washed with 1 × PEMTT buffer and manually dechorionated . Embryos were incubated for one hr with blocking solution ( 1% DMSO , 10% Normal Goat Serum , 200 µM KCl in PEMTT ) at RT . The embryos were incubated with mouse anti-E-Cadherin antibody ( BD ) in blocking solution overnight at 4C , which was followed by washing with 1 × PEMTT and incubation with Alexa 568 goat anti mouse IgG ( Invitrogen ) ( 1:500 ) diluted in blocking solution for 2 hr . The embryos were finally washed with PEMTT and then mounted for imaging . Fish were anesthetized using Tricaine ( United States Biochemical ) prior to imaging . Brightfield images were taken using a Nikon SMZ1500 fluorescence microscope with an Insight Firewire two digital camera and SPOT advanced software . Fluorescent images were taken using a Zeiss Axio Observer . Z1 microscope and captured using a Zeiss AxioCam CCD camera . For confocal analysis , fixed and stained embryos were mounted in 1% low melt agarose ( National Diagnostics ) dissolved in water . For cell imaging , 10 , 000 HEK 293 T cells were plated onto four well MilliCell EZ slides ( EMD Millipore ) and transfected as described below . Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min , washed three times in PBS , permeabilized with 50 ug/mL digitonin in PBS for 5 min at 37C , then quenched with 50 mM NH4Cl at 37C for 5 min . After 3 washes for 5 min each in PBS , cells were blocked in 5% goat serum at 37C for 30 min and washed for 3 times for 5 min each in PBS . DAPI was added at 1:2000 dilution by volume for 2 min , then washed for 5 times for 5 min each in PBS . Slides were mounted in ProLong Gold Antifade reagent ( ThermoFisher Scientific , Waltham , MA ) overnight at 4C . Confocal images were taken using an Olympus Fluoview Microscope with a 60x lens and analyzed using Fluoview software . Images were processed with ImageJ ( 1 . 42q ) Imaris ( Bitplane Inc . ) and Adobe PhotoshopCS4 software . A genomic region including 1680 bp of sequence upstream of the first exon of cers2b was cloned into the TOPO TA vector and transferred to the Kpn1/Xho1 sites of the pGL3 basic firefly luciferase reporter plasmid ( Promega ) . To generate shorter promoter constructs the same 3’ primer was used along with 5’ primers targeting progressively proximal sequences . These PCR fragments were cloned into TOPO TA and transferred to the Kpn1/Xho1 sites of the pGL3 basic firefly luciferase reporter plasmid . A construct containing the first 400 bp of sequence ( the most distal 5’ sequences of the full-length promoter construct ) was also generated by PCR and cloned into a pGL3 promoter firefly luciferase reporter plasmid containing an SV40 promoter ( Promega ) . Primer sequences are: 1680 bp: 5’-ATGAAAATATATGTGAATAAACTGCAA 1631 bp: 5’-AAACGAAGGTTGAGGGAACG 1621 bp: 5’-TGAGGGAACGTTTCTTCATG 1611 bp: 5’-TTTCTTCATGGTTTAAAAGCGTTC 1597 bp: 5’-AAAAGCGTTCTTTAGATTATTAAAATG 1498 bp: 5’-AAAACTGAATATTGAGTAGGGGG 1281 bp: 5’-AAACTCAGTCTCCCGCAAAGTT 881 bp: 5’-TAGGCTATGATGTTGGGTTACTTTGT common reverse primer: 5’-GTAACTCACGTAGGATCGGC Two point mutations in the HOX domain ( R121W , R122S ) were generated using the full-length 1680 bp pGL3 construct via site directed mutagenesis . Likewise , two point mutations in the Lag domain ( H212D , H213D ) were similarly generated . Mutations were confirmed by directly sequencing the plasmids . RNA used for micro-injection was obtained by in vitro transcription using the linearized vector pRL-SV40 ( Promega ) . Following linearization of the template with BamH1 , one microgram was used to generate capped mRNAs with the mMessage mMachine kit ( Ambion ) , followed by precipitation with LiCl . RNA was quantified by optical density , and integrity was confirmed by gel electrophoresis . Single cell staged embryos were injected with 20 pg of luciferase reporter DNA and 0 . 05 pg of RNA encoding Renilla luciferase ( to control for injection , lysate harvest , etc . ) . Following microinjection , embryos were cultured in 1x E3 solution until 50% epiboly , at which point three embryos were collected and lysed in 50 μl of 1x Passive Lysis Buffer ( Promega ) . Luciferase assays were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions . For each assay , 20 μl of lysate was added to 100 μl of luciferase substrate [LARII] , and luminosity was measured in a Turner TD-20e luminometer . The signal was quenched using 100 μl of stop and glo buffer and renilla luciferase activity was measured . The firefly luciferase values were divided by corresponding values of the control renilla luciferase . Human ( embryonic kidney ) 293T/17 cells were purchased from ATCC ( CRL-11268 ) , with validated certificate of analysis provided by ATCC . Cell cultures were routinely tested and found negative for mycoplasma . 250 , 000 293 T cells per well in 24 well dishes were transfected with Lipofectamine LTX Reagent with Plus Reagent ( ThermoFisher , Waltham , MA ) with 250 ng of a PCS2 +expression vector , with or without the cers2b cDNA , along with 250 ng of pGL3 reporter plasmid as described above and 5 ng of CMV-RL to normalize for transfection efficiency and lysate harvest , for 24 hr . Cells were then washed with PBS and incubated with or without 10 μM sphingosine for 6 hr . Cells were subsequently lysed in 100 μl of 1x Passive Lysis Buffer per well ( Promega ) . Luciferase assays were performed as described above . 293 T cells were cultured in 10 cm dishes to 70% confluence and transfected with 6 μg of Cers2 human ORF expression plasmid ( OriGene ) using Lipofectamine LTX Reagent with Plus Reagent ( ThermoFisher , Waltham , MA ) for 24 hr . Cells were then washed with PBS and incubated with or without 10 μM sphingosine for 6 hr . Subsequently the NE-PER Nuclear Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagent kit ( ThermoFisher , Waltham , MA ) was used to generate nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions . Nuclear membrane sub-fractionation was accomplished using the Minute Nuclear Envelope Protein Extraction Kit ( inVent ) . For western blotting , cellular samples were lysed in buffer ( 20 mM Tris pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 1% NP-40 , with cOmplete Mini Protease Inhibitor Cocktail ( Sigma ) added immediately prior to use ) and heated in 4x NuPage LDS Sample buffer and 10x NuPage Reducing Agent ( both ThermoFisher , Waltham , MA ) for 10 min at 95C . Proteins were resolved by electrophoresis on pre-cast 10% NuPage Bis-Trisgels and transferred to PVDF membranes using the iBlot system ( both from Invitrogen ) . Membranes were blocked in 3% BSA in TBS with 1% Tween-20 . Membranes were probed overnight with anti-Cers2 antibody ( Sigma ) at a 1:250 dilution , or with anti-GAPDH antibody ( Abcam 9484 ) at 1:10 , 000 as a control for cytoplasmic proteins , anti-TATA Binding Protein ( Abcam 51841 ) at 1:1000 as a control for nuclear proteins , and anti-LaminB1 ( Abcam 16048 ) at 1:5000 as a control for nuclear envelope proteins . Blots were then probed with HRP-tagged secondary antibodies ( Bio-Rad ) and West Pico Chemiluminescence Reagent ( Pierce ) at 1:2000 in 5% milk-TBST for 1 hr at RT . Images were obtained and analyzed by c-DiGit Blot Scanner ( LI-COR ) and the corresponding Image Studio software . Whole mount in situ hybridization was performed as described ( Alexander et al . , 1998 ) . Ovaries were removed from mutant or wildtype female adult fish , and oocytes gently dissociated in PBS . Following fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde ( Sigma ) , hybridization was performed at 70C in 50% formamide buffer ( Roche ) with a digoxigenin-labeled RNA probe for cers2b , synthesized in vitro as an anti-sense strand using T7 polymerase from the BamH1-linearized cDNA clone ."}
{"doi": "elife-74005-v3", "abstract": "In cooperative systems exhibiting division of labor , such as microbial communities , multicellular organisms , and social insect colonies , individual units share costs and benefits through both task specialization and exchanged materials . Socially exchanged fluids , like seminal fluid and milk , allow individuals to molecularly influence conspecifics . Many social insects have a social circulatory system , where food and endogenously produced molecules are transferred mouth-to-mouth ( stomodeal trophallaxis ) , connecting all the individuals in the society . To understand how these endogenous molecules relate to colony life , we used quantitative proteomics to investigate the trophallactic fluid within colonies of the carpenter ant Camponotus floridanus . We show that different stages of the colony life cycle circulate different types of proteins: young colonies prioritize direct carbohydrate processing; mature colonies prioritize accumulation and transmission of stored resources . Further , colonies circulate proteins implicated in oxidative stress , ageing , and social insect caste determination , potentially acting as superorganismal hormones . Brood-caring individuals that are also closer to the queen in the social network ( nurses ) showed higher abundance of oxidative stress-related proteins . Thus , trophallaxis behavior could provide a mechanism for distributed metabolism in social insect societies . The ability to thoroughly analyze the materials exchanged between cooperative units makes social insect colonies useful models to understand the evolution and consequences of metabolic division of labor at other scales .", "plain language summary": "Division of labor is essential for cooperation , because groups can achieve more when individuals specialize in different tasks . This happens across the natural world , from different cells in organisms performing specific roles , to the individuals in an ant colony carrying out diverse duties . In both of these systems , individuals work together to ensure the survival of the collective unit – the body or the colony – instead of competing against each other . One of the main ways division of labor is evident within these two systems is regarding reproduction . Both in the body and in an ant colony , only one or a few individual units can reproduce , while the rest provide support . In the case of ant colonies , only queens and males reproduce , while the young workers nurse the brood and older workers forage for food . This intense cooperation requires close communication between individual units – in the case of some species of ants , by sharing fluids mouth-to-mouth . These fluids contain food but also many molecules produced by the ants themselves , including proteins . Given that both individuals and the colony as a whole change as they age – with workers acquiring new roles , and new queens and males only reared once the colony is mature – it is likely that the proteins transmitted in the fluid also change . To better understand whether the lifecycles of individuals and the age of the colony affect the fluids shared by carpenter ants Camponotus floridanus , Hakala et al . examined the ant-produced proteins in these fluids . This revealed differences in the proteins shared by young and mature colonies , and young nurse ants and older forager ants . In young colonies , the fluids contained proteins involved in fast sugar processing; while in mature colonies , the fluids contained more proteins to store nutrients , which help insect larvae grow into larger individuals , like queens . Young worker ants , who spend their time nursing the brood , produced more anti-aging proteins . This may be because these ants are in close contact with the queen , who lives much longer than the rest of the ants in the colony . Taken together , these observations suggest that ants divide the labor of metabolism , as well as work and reproduction . Dividing the labor of metabolism among individuals is one more similarity between ants and the cells of a multicellular organism , like a fly or a human . Division of labor allows the sharing of burden , with some individuals lightening the load of others . Understanding how ants achieve this by sharing fluids could shed new light on this complex exchange at other scales or in other organisms . By matching proteins to life stages , researchers have a starting point to examine individual molecules in more detail .", "article": "1 Introduction In the course of social evolution , related organisms have formed cooperative entities such as multicellular organisms or groups of social animals ( Szathmáry , 2015; Queller , 1992; Hamilton , 1963 ) . In social animal groups , collective decisions on movement , reproduction and even development are needed for survival ( Miller et al . , 2013; Couzin , 2009 ) . Some social groups have taken this coordination to a very high level: social insect societies develop and function as a single unit instead of as competing individuals , as ‘superorganisms’ paralleling the development of multicellular organisms as a single unit rather than as a set of competing cells ( Johnson and Linksvayer , 2010; Boomsma and Gawne , 2018 ) . In these superorganismal societies , reproductive queens and males function as the germline , and workers as the soma . Similarly to different tissues in multicellular organisms , workers can be further specialized and exhibit division of labor across different behavioral and morphological castes ( Bourke , 2011 ) . While morphological castes are determined during development , the behavioral caste of an individual worker typically changes during its lifetime . At the beginning of their adult life , workers specialize inside the nest as nurses focusing on brood care , and as they age , they switch to foraging outside of the nest ( Huang and Robinson , 1996 ) . Social insect colonies also go through life stages . Young colonies have an initial growth phase where they solely produce one type of worker , and only later in their life cycle they may produce more specialized worker castes and finally , males and queens ( Wilson , 1971 ) . The switch to reproductive phase is a major life-history transition at the colony level , and connected to female caste determination . In social Hymenoptera , determination of whether a female larva develops into a queen or a worker , and what kind of worker exactly , is controlled by intricate differences of gene expression of the same female genome , guided primarily by environmental factors , in particular nutrition and social cues , sometimes partially influenced by genetics ( Wheeler , 1986; Anderson et al . , 2008; Rajakumar et al . , 2018; Schwander et al . , 2010 ) . Coordinated function of tightly integrated groups such as social insect colonies , and subgroups such as their different castes , has been described as social physiology ( Friedman et al . , 2020 ) , consisting of various behavioral , morphological , and molecular mechanisms that ensure cooperation and inclusive fitness benefits for all group members . As a part of their social physiology , some social insect societies have developed a form of social circulatory system ( Wheeler , 1928 ) , where nutrition and endogenously produced functional molecules , such as hormones , are transferred mouth-to-mouth from the foregut of one individual to another ( LeBoeuf et al . , 2016; LeBoeuf et al . , 2018 ) . This social fluid transfer is called stomodeal trophallaxis ( Meurville and LeBoeuf , 2021 ) . It ensures not only that food is distributed to all adults and larvae within the colony , but also that all individuals of the colony are interconnected through shared bodily fluids . Trophallactic fluid of ants and bees typically contains endogenous proteins involved in digestion , immune defense and developmental regulation ( LeBoeuf et al . , 2016 ) , indicating that this fluid transmits more than food . Molecular signals are important in controlling the colony life histories and guiding caste determination both at the colony level and at the individual level . Queen pheromones are central signaling molecules acting across individuals ( Kocher and Grozinger , 2011; Nijhout and Wheeler , 1982; Pamminger et al . , 2016 ) . Juvenile hormone and vitellogenin are central signaling molecules in classical insect development that may also play across-individual roles in some social insects ( LeBoeuf et al . , 2016; LeBoeuf et al . , 2018; Scharf et al . , 2007; Harwood et al . , 2019 ) . Together with fundamental nutrient-response signaling pathways ( insulin , TOR ) , these molecules establish the developmental trajectories of individuals ( Chandra et al . , 2018; Libbrecht et al . , 2013 ) . In solitary organisms , such molecules are produced and function solely within the organism’s own body . In contrast , in social Hymenoptera even the molecules traditionally functioning within-individuals can be secreted to the crop and distributed among the society members through trophallaxis and the social circulatory system ( LeBoeuf et al . , 2016 ) . Molecular components transmitted through trophallaxis , namely juvenile hormone and juvenile hormone esterase-like proteins , have been shown to influence the development of ant larvae ( LeBoeuf et al . , 2016; LeBoeuf et al . , 2018 ) . Thus , it is possible that molecules in trophallactic fluid may influence caste determination , similarly to honeybee workers feeding larvae with royal jelly to direct their development toward a queen fate ( LeBoeuf et al . , 2016; Buttstedt et al . , 2014; Buttstedt et al . , 2016; Kamakura , 2011; Kucharski et al . , 2015 ) . The molecular functions of trophallactic fluid are still largely unstudied , but it is known , for example , that social isolation changes its composition ( LeBoeuf et al . , 2016 ) , with some protein components of this fluid shifting with social environment . In medicine , such correlations are typically used to define biomarkers for specific conditions and treatments , and often both accurately predict function and provide mechanistic insights ( Strimbu and Tavel , 2010 ) . We propose that trophallactic fluid could both reflect and affect the social environments of the colony , thus providing important cues for collective decision making . However , it is not yet feasible to study the causes and consequences of the molecular composition of trophallactic fluid , as it is still largely unknown how much and what kind of qualitative and quantitative variation is present . If indeed trophallactic fluid acts as a form of social circulatory system , managing distributed metabolic processes related to colony maturation , endogenously produced factors should correlate with colony life stages . To test this , we analyzed the trophallactic fluid proteome of the carpenter ant Camponotus floridanus at different scales . Our aim is to demonstrate that trophallactic fluid proteomes are filled with biomarkers reflecting biotic and abiotic conditions at both the colony and individual scale . 2 Results Over the 73 colony and 40 single-individual trophallactic fluid samples analyzed , a total of 519 proteins were identified ( Figure 2 ) . Trophallactic fluid samples contained a set of 27 ‘core’ trophallactic fluid proteins that were present in all samples regardless of life-cycle , life-stage or environmental conditions . Fifty-seven percent of the 519 proteins , we observed were present in less than half of the samples . Even though the most common proteins displayed higher average abundance , across the entire dataset , protein abundance did not correlate with the proportion of samples containing the protein – even proteins present in only a small proportion of the samples in some cases exhibited high abundance ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) . The overall protein abundance was higher in colony samples relative to single individual samples , reflective of the larger trophallactic fluid volume collected . The number of proteins identified for a given sample correlated with trophallactic fluid sample volume ( Pearson correlation test p < 0 . 03 , r = 0 . 24 for colony samples and p < 0 . 01 , r = –0 . 40 for single-individual samples ) . Field-collected samples exhibited more variable proteomes than did lab-collected samples ( Figure 2b , gamma GLM posthoc p-values < 0 . 001 , Figure 2—source data 1 ) . Further , colonies that had been in the lab for more than one year showed less variable proteomes than did colonies that had been in the lab for only six months ( Figure 2b , gamma GLM z = −4 . 46 , SE = 0 . 04 , p < 0 . 001 ) . The trophallactic proteome variability of young and mature colonies did not differ significantly , nor did nurses’ and foragers’ ( Figure 2b ) . Foragers had fewer identified proteins in their trophallactic fluid than did nurses ( Figure 2a , negative binomial z = 3 . 72 , SE = 0 . 08 , p = 0 . 005 ) , and there were no significant differences among the main full colony samples ( Figure 2—source data 2 ) . When the principal components of the trophallactic fluid proteomes were analyzed , the samples tended broadly to align with others of the same type , although clusters were not fully distinct ( Figure 3A and B ) . We developed a metric , self-similarity ( S ) , to assess the depth of difference within and across sample types ( Figure 3C ) . Because field-collected samples had more diverse protein content even within sample types ( Figures 2 and 3A ) , the self-similarity in the Young vs . Mature comparison is low ( Figure 3C ) . Single individual samples , and especially forager samples were less complex , allowing a larger proportion of their dissimilarity to be explained by sample type . Further , because our classification of nurse and forager is based on the individuals’ location on brood or out-of-nest , it is possible that some nurse-classified individuals were either misclassified , transitioning from nurse to forager , or had trophallactic fluid in their crop uncharacteristic of their behavioral caste . In addition to characterizing the most abundant and core proteins of the trophallactic fluid ( Figure 4 , Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) , we wanted to robustly identify proteins that differ significantly in our comparisons despite the noise inherently present in this social fluid . To accomplish this , we chose to overlay three distinct statistical approaches ( Figure 1B ) : classical frequentist , empirical Bayes and machine-learning in the form of random forest classification . In our main comparisons , Young vs . Mature colonies from the field , young colonies in the Field vs . Lab , and individual Nurses vs . Foragers in the lab , we found significant differences between groups with all three analysis methods ( Figure 5 , Figure 5—figure supplement 1 , Figure 5—figure supplement 2 , full results for the significantly differing proteins in Supplementary file 2 and for all proteins in Supplementary files 3-5 ) . For the Young vs . Mature comparisons , there were 10 , 10 , and 30 differentially abundant proteins according to frequentist t-test , empirical Bayesian LIMMA and the random forest approach , respectively . Similarly , for the Nurse vs . Forager comparison there were 21 , 57 , and 26 differentially abundant proteins , and when young colonies were brought to the laboratory and resampled after six months , 17 , 31 , or 29 proteins had significantly different abundance . The average accuracies of classification for comparisons with the random forest approach were: Young vs . Mature , 87 %; Nurse vs . Forager , 93 %; and Field vs . Lab , 91 % . This indicates that our trained classifier can predict whether a trophallactic fluid sample originates from a nurse or a forager with 93 % accuracy . We found no clear signature of spatial structure ( East vs . West ) in the trophallactic fluid proteomes . The frequentist analysis between different sampling areas found no significantly different proteins , and the random forest model did not reach high enough accuracy for this dataset to be informative ( 58 % classification accuracy ) . Only the empirical Bayes approach found eight proteins that significantly differed between the sampling areas ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1 , Supplementary files 2 and 4 ) . To leverage the unique benefits of the different forms of analysis , we focused our further analyses on proteins significantly different in two out of the three forms of analysis . Here , young and mature colonies differed by 12 proteins , and nurses and foragers differed by 19 proteins ( Figure 5 ) . When young colonies were brought to the laboratory and resampled six months later , the trophallactic fluid proteomes differed significantly by 20 proteins . Additionally , the single individual dataset showed that proteomes are affected both by colony of origin and by behavioral role of the individual , with 60 proteins showing significant interaction between the two factors ( Supplementary file 3 ) . To investigate the functions of the proteins found in trophallactic fluid , we performed functional enrichment analysis of gene ontology terms , pathways and protein-protein interaction ( PPI ) networks of the trophallactic fluid proteins’ Drosophila melanogaster orthologs . The 60 most abundant proteins in trophallactic fluid ( Figure 4 , Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) are predominantly involved in the biological processes of carbohydrate metabolism , lipid and sterol transport ( Figure 6 , Figure 6—source data 1 , FDR < 0 . 00038 , FDR < 0 . 0013 and FDR < 0 . 0087 respectively ) . The larval serum protein complex was represented by three out of four members in both the most abundant proteins and in the significantly differing proteins ( hexamerins/arylphorins: Lsp1beta , Lsp1gamma , and Lsp2 ) . A strong representation of the innate immune system ( Reactome pathway FDR < 6 . 57e-5 ) was evident as were lysosomal processes ( KEGG pathway , FDR < 3 . 21e-9 ) . Beyond the 60 most abundant proteins in trophallactic fluid , many others are of interest as well . A critical protein in insect physiology , vitellogenin is the 93rd most abundant protein in trophallactic fluid , present in 77% and 88% of colony and single individual samples , respectively . Three of the 60 most abundant proteins had no similarity to Drosophila genes , and thus could not be included in the functional enrichment analysis . One of them is a putative odorant receptor , another a G-protein alpha subunit , and the third showed no orthology to characterized proteins . None of these proteins significantly differed in more than one analysis for a given comparison . Many of the trophallactic fluid proteins , abundant or significantly differing , were represented in trophallactic fluid by multiple genes from the same protein family , in some cases part of tandem repeats in the genome , indicative of relatively recent evolution . Multiple proteins of the same family were found in the most abundant trophallactic fluid proteins ( Figure 4 , Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) : a family of cathepsinD-like proteins ( six in the top 60; LeBoeuf et al . , 2016; Hamilton et al . , 2011 ) and a family of Maltase-B1-like proteins ( five in the top 60 ) . In the list of significantly differing proteins ( Figure 5 , Figure 5—figure supplement 2 ) , we observed fewer members of these families and instead saw three guanine deaminase proteins , all of which significantly differed in the Young vs . Mature comparison . Other families that showed duplications were glucose dehydrogenases , CREG1 and tobi-like proteins ( target-of-brain-insulin ) . There was an overlap of 16 proteins between the most abundant proteins and the proteins significant in two out of three of our statistical methods in any of the comparisons . The PPI network for our differentially abundant protein set ( 46 proteins , Figure 5 ) was similar to that of the most abundant proteins ( Figure 4 ) but with increased interaction in the networks of the proteins themselves beyond what would be expected by chance ( PPI enrichment p-value < 2 . 35e-11 in differentially abundant proteins relative to p-value < 1 . 59e-9 in abundant proteins ) , with noted enrichment in oxidation-reduction processes ( FDR < 0 . 0026 ) and stronger enrichment in carbohydrate metabolic processes ( FDR < 2 . 15e-6 ) . To better understand the functions of the significantly differing proteins in each comparison , we analyzed the GO terms and PPI networks of proteins significant in two out of three statistical methods separately for each of our three main comparisons ( Figure 6 , Figure 6—source data 1 ) . The Nurse vs . Forager comparison yielded a network of proteins with more interaction than would have been predicted by chance ( PPI enrichment p-value < 2 . 57e-4 ) as well as a higher degree of PPI enrichment than the other two comparisons ( Young vs . Mature p < 0 . 002 and Field v Lab p < 0 . 02 ) . The orthologs of differentially abundant proteins found in the behavioral caste comparison involved not only carbohydrate processing ( FDR < 1 . 7e-4 ) , but also oxidation-reduction and malate metabolic processes ( FDR < 0 . 023 and FDR < 0 . 02 , respectively ) . These pathways have been implicated in the determination of lifespan ( Wiley and Campisi , 2016 ) . Indeed , two of the 46 differentially abundant proteins over all comparisons have D . melanogaster orthologs with the gene ontology term ‘determination of adult lifespan’ ( Men , Sod1 ) . The C . floridanus tetraspanin , significantly more abundant in nurse trophallactic fluid , is a one-to-many ortholog to the family of Tsp42E genes , one of which has also been implicated in determination of adult lifespan in D . melanogaster . As trophallactic fluid samples of young and mature colonies were distinguishable by principal component analysis and our random forest classifier , we wanted to see if our trained classifier could assess a change in maturity of our young colonies after they had spent six months in the laboratory . Our random forest classifier assigned an average out-of-box maturity score to our 16 laboratory samples of 42 % mature , reflecting the intermediate position of the laboratory colony samples in Figure 3 . 3 Discussion We found that trophallactic fluid includes many enzymes involved in metabolism and protein products of metabolism . Many are core trophallactic fluid proteins present in all samples , but many also differ significantly among the colony and individual life stages . Some proteins abundant in mature colonies ( Lsps , apolpp Burmester and Scheller , 1999; Burmester , 2002; Burmester , 1999 ) are major insect nutrient storage proteins ( Burmester , 1999 ) that may be required to consolidate resources into large workers and sexuals , potentially acting as superorganismal hormones . Proteins abundant in foragers and young colonies ( Gld , tobi , Amy , Mal , Buch et al . , 2008; White et al . , 2021 ) are well-conserved enzymes for fast sugar processing . This suggests a functional role of trophallactic fluid in the social physiology of ant colonies . Similar shifts in protein composition or gene expression can be seen in different tissues of multicellular organisms as life-stage priorities change , for example in the midgut of drosophila females after mating , where changes in expression are observed in many genes orthologous to the proteins we found here ( White et al . , 2021 ) . Additionally , Drosophila larval hemolymph proteome changes as development unfolds ( Handke et al . , 2013 ) , and many of these same proteins also appear in our comparisons of worker trophallactic fluid . We suggest that regulation of larval development may at least in part occur over the social network of ants , in line with previous experimental results ( LeBoeuf et al . , 2018 ) . Viewing the colony as a superorganism , the division of reproductive labor between different types of workers ( soma ) and queens ( germline ) should result in different individuals requiring differing resources and sustaining differing metabolic costs . Our results support this hypothesis . We show that trophallactic fluid transmits numerous factors linked to ageing and coping with oxidative stress , including two of the three most well-known antioxidant enzymes: superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase ( Monaghan et al . , 2009 ) . These and other ageing-related proteins , such as those in redox pathways and malate metabolism ( Wiley and Campisi , 2016; Koch et al . , 2021 ) , are especially elevated in nurses , the individuals that are physically the closest to the brood and queen in the trophallactic network . These results link trophallactic fluid to one of the main topics of evolutionary ecology: the longevity-fecundity tradeoff between reproduction and coping with oxidative stress ( Monaghan et al . , 2009; Flatt , 2011; Edward and Chapman , 2011 ) . Social insect individuals seemingly escape this tradeoff with long-lived and highly reproductive queens and short-lived , non-reproductive workers ( Monaghan et al . , 2009; Edward and Chapman , 2011; Heinze and Schrempf , 2008 ) . We reveal a possible distributed metabolism which could explain why social insects seem to subvert this tradeoff . If molecules dealing with oxidative stress , or beneficial products of metabolism ( nutrient storage proteins ) can be spread over the circulatory system , as our results show , certain individuals may bear the costs that others in the network incur . This could account for some of the puzzling results on the plasticity of senescence in social insects ( Kramer et al . , 2021; Heinze and Giehr , 2021; Lucas et al . , 2019 ) , and provides a new perspective to analyze the regulatory changes of social insect reproductive castes with regard to ageing ( Korb et al . , 2021; Negroni et al . , 2019; Elsner et al . , 2018; Corona et al . , 2005; Gstöttl et al . , 2020; Corona et al . , 2016; von Wyschetzki et al . , 2015 ) . While most previous work has focused almost exclusively on gene expression , we show that for species that engage in trophallaxis , expression studies are necessary but insufficient to understand where in the colony the relevant genes act . Our gene-set enrichment analysis showed significant enrichment in immunity-related proteins characteristic of phagocytic hemocytes ( Shokal and Eleftherianos , 2017 ) in trophallactic fluid ( ‘innate immune system’ , ‘complement cascade’ , ‘neutrophil degranulation’ ) . These results indicate that hemocytes may themselves be transmitted mouth-to-mouth , and generally shows the involvement of the social circulatory system in colony-level immune responses with implications for social immunity . Our results do not show clear caste differentiation in the abundance of immune-related proteins , as did a study in honey bees in glands that produce trophallactic fluid proteins ( Vannette et al . , 2015 ) , though we do see similar regulation of sugar processing enzymes and glutathione-S-transferases . Trophallactic fluid is one of many social fluids in biology – milk and seminal fluid are similar examples of direct transfers of biological material between individuals . Such socially exchanged materials often contain molecules that target receivers’ physiology beyond the fundamental reason for the transfer ( Bromfield et al . , 2014; Savino et al . , 2013 ) , and allow social effects to directly influence the evolutionary process as indirect genetic effects ( Linksvayer , 2015; McGlothlin et al . , 2010; Wolf et al . , 1998 ) . Some of the proteins we find to be significantly differing in our comparisons have previously been implicated in these other social transfers . For example , one of our protein hits is orthologous to Drosophila’s CG10433 , a seminal fluid protein ( Findlay et al . , 2008 ) that impacts juvenile-hormone-associated hatch-rate post-mating ( Liu et al . , 2014 ) . In another parallel to a phylogenetically distant social fluid , trophallactic fluid’s most abundant protein is CREG1 , a secreted growth-associated glycoprotein also abundant in mammalian milk ( Zhang et al . , 2015 ) . Finding molecular parallels in distinct behavioral processes hints at the fundamental role of these exchanges in the evolution of social physiology , and possibly common adaptive requirements for bioactive social fluids . Lysosomal pathways are enriched in our most abundant trophallactic fluid proteins and in our set of significantly varying trophallactic fluid proteins between nurses and foragers , according to the KEGG analysis . Lysosomes are acidic and can be major players in secretion , autophagic flux and exocytosis ( Tancini et al . , 2020; Csizmadia et al . , 2018; Maruzs et al . , 2019 ) – processes that may be important for nurses that feed larvae by trophallaxis . These significant lysosomal signatures we see in trophallactic fluid may indicate the mechanism of secretion ( Martínez et al . , 2020 ) , or may give us cues of how this fluid has evolved . As trophallactic fluid has become acidified in formicine ants ( Tragust et al . , 2020 ) , lysosomal genes could have been duplicated and neofunctionalized to a new role in this acidic fluid , similarly to juvenile-hormone-esterase-like proteins in trophallactic fluid ( LeBoeuf et al . , 2018 ) . The fact that many abundant trophallactic fluid proteins represent clusters of related proteins from a few families ( cathepsins , guanine deaminases , maltases ) suggests there has been adaptive evolution in the proteins arriving in this fluid . We show that the protein composition of ant trophallactic fluid varies across different external contexts and internal conditions both at the colony and at the individual level , suggesting that the dynamic trophallactic fluid proteome has key functions in social physiology and life cycle of colonies . By describing the natural variation of trophallactic fluid we have laid the groundwork for future studies on the possible functions of these proteins in controlling the colony life cycle , senescence , and behavior . 4 Materials and methods Camponotus floridanus is a common species of carpenter ant in the south-eastern USA , and has already been the focus of previous trophallactic fluid analyses ( LeBoeuf et al . , 2016; LeBoeuf et al . , 2018 ) . They live in dead wood or in man-made structures , often in urban habitats , and forage for honeydew , floral nectar , extra-floral nectar , and arthropod prey . Each colony has a single , singly mated queen ( Gadau et al . , 1996 ) , and polydomous nest-structures where queenless satellite nests are common . Colonies grow to tens of thousands of workers and produce sexual brood only after multiple years of initial growth . Large established colonies have two morphologically differentiated worker castes , with variably sized small-headed minors focusing on brood care when young and foraging when old , and big-headed majors that engage in nest defense , foraging and food storage ( Deyrup , 2017 ) . The species was identified based on worker and queen morphology ( Deyrup , 2017; Deyrup , 2003; Moreau et al . , 2014 ) . In line with previous studies , we use the name C . floridanus with the knowledge that the taxonomy and nomenclature of the C . atriceps complex ( to which it belongs ) is not fully resolved ( Deyrup , 2017 ) . We collected full young colonies ( 0–80 workers ) and mature colony extracts ( 30–200 workers ) on several Florida Keys islands ( Figure 1 and Supplementary file 1 ) in winter 2019 and 2020 . A colony was deemed ‘young’ if the worker population was <100 , primarily minors , and the queen was found ( meaning both that the species could be clearly identified and that the nest was not a queenless satellite of an established colony ) , and ‘mature‘ if the colony was larger ( > 1000 individuals visible ) and the opened nest contained many large aggressive majors . Young colonies lack majors ( Gibson , 1989 ) and individuals are generally less aggressive . We only collected mature colony samples when we also found larval brood in the opened nest . In our study area , we observed that young colonies are typically found nesting in different material than are mature colonies . Young colonies are often found under stones or in lumps of clay-like mud associated with crab burrows a short distance from the water , whereas the mature colonies were found nesting in large pieces of damp rotting wood . Young colonies were brought to the lab and maintained in fluon-coated plastic boxes with a mesh-ventilated lid , at 25 °C with 60 % relative humidity and a 12 hr light/dark cycle . Each colony was provided with one or more glass tube for nesting , 10 % sugar water , and a Bhatkar & Whitcomb diet ( Bhatkar and Whitcomb , 1970 ) and some Drosophila melanogaster . One week prior to proteomic sampling , we substituted the honey-based food with maple syrup-based food to avoid contamination with honeybee proteins ( as in LeBoeuf et al . , 2016 ) . Field samples of trophallactic fluid were collected within eight hours of ant collection . Of the 20 young colonies and 23 mature colonies , workers collected from two of the mature colonies ( L and N ) were subdivided into six fragments to assess variation within a single colony ( two samples from major workers , two samples from brood-associated workers , and two samples from the remaining minor workers ) . For all other analyses , only one of these for each colony ( referred to as minors1 ) was used to avoid pseudo-replication . In the laboratory , the trophallactic fluid samples underlying the Field vs . Lab comparison were sampled after six months in the lab . The four colonies used for the single individual analyses had been in the lab for 18 months at the time of trophallactic fluid collection . Trophallactic fluid was obtained from CO2- or cold-anesthetized workers whose abdomens were gently squeezed to force them to regurgitate the contents of their crops . This method of collection was shown previously to correspond to the fluid shared during the act of adult-adult stomodeal trophallaxis ( LeBoeuf et al . , 2016 ) . For each colony , at least 30 individuals were sampled to obtain at least 10 µl of raw trophallactic fluid . For many young colonies only smaller samples were possible , because of the low number of workers ( Supplementary file 1 ) . Young colony samples were only used for further analysis if at least 2 . 5 µl of trophallactic fluid were collected . For single individual samples , workers with visibly full abdomens were chosen and the obtained sample volumes ranged from 0 . 7 µl to 2 . 2 µl . An individual was classified as forager , when it was seen outside the nest tube in the feeding area of an undisturbed laboratory nest box , and a nurse , when it remained in the nest tube even after the tube was removed from the original laboratory nest and placed into a new one . For colonies from which individual samples were collected , a pooled sample was also taken from individuals that remained after individual sampling . Samples were collected with glass capillaries into 5 µl of 1 x Sigmafast Protease Inhibitor Cocktail ( Sigma-Aldrich ) with 50 mM Tris pH nine in LoBind eppendorf tubes and were stored –80 C until further analysis . The total proteomics sample number is 73 colony samples of following types: 23 mature colonies with two of them sampled six times , 20 young colonies in the field , 16 young colonies in the laboratory , four laboratory colonies used for single individual sampling; and 40 individual samples: 20 nurses and 20 foragers . Samples were mixed with Laemmli sample buffer and pH was adjusted with 1 M Tris-Cl , pH 7 . After reduction with 1 mM DTT for 10 min at 75 °C and alkylation using 5 . 5 mM iodoacetamide for 10 min at room temperature protein samples were separated on 4–12% gradient gels ( ExpressPlus , GeneScript ) . Each gel lane was cut into small pieces , proteins were in-gel digested with trypsin ( Promega ) and the resulting peptide mixtures were processed on STAGE tips ( Rappsilber et al . , 2007; Shevchenko et al . , 2006 ) . LC-MS/MS measurements were performed on a QExactive plus mass spectrometer ( Thermo Scientific ) coupled to an EasyLC 1000 nanoflow-HPLC . HPLC-column tips ( fused silica ) with 75 µm inner diameter were self-packed with Reprosil-Pur 120 C18-AQ , 1 . 9 µm ( Dr . Maisch GmbH ) to a length of 20 cm . A gradient of A ( 0 . 1 % formic acid in water ) and B ( 0 . 1 % formic acid in 80 % acetonitrile in water ) with increasing organic proportion was used for peptide separation ( loading of sample with 0 % B; separation ramp: from 5 to 30% B within 85 min ) . The flow rate was 250 nl/min and for sample application 650 nl/min . The mass spectrometer was operated in the data-dependent mode and switched automatically between MS ( max . of 1 × 106 ions ) and MS/MS . Each MS scan was followed by a maximum of ten MS/MS scans using normalized collision energy of 25 % and a target value of 1 , 000 . Parent ions with a charge state form z = 1 and unassigned charge states were excluded from fragmentation . The mass range for MS was m/z = 370–1750 . The resolution for MS was set to 70 , 000 and for MS/MS to 17 , 500 . MS parameters were as follows: spray voltage 2 . 3 kV; no sheath and auxiliary gas flow; ion-transfer tube temperature 250 °C . The MS raw data files were uploaded into MaxQuant software ( Tyanova et al . , 2016a ) , version 1 . 6 . 2 . 10 , for peak detection , generation of peak lists of mass error corrected peptides , and for database searches . MaxQuant was set up to search both the UniProt ( RRID:SCR_002380 , https://www . uniprot . org/ ) and NCBI ( RRID:SCR_003496 , https://www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov/ ) databases restricted to C . floridanus ( UniProt , February 2020 version; NCBI RefSeq , version 7 . 5 ) , along with common contaminants , such as keratins and enzymes used for digestion . Carbamidomethylcysteine was set as fixed modification and protein amino-terminal acetylation and oxidation of methionine were set as variable modifications . Three missed cleavages were allowed , enzyme specificity was trypsin/P , and the MS/MS tolerance was set to 20 ppm . The average mass precision of identified peptides was in general less than one ppm after recalibration . Peptide lists were further used by MaxQuant to identify and relatively quantify proteins using the following parameters: peptide and protein false discovery rates , based on a forward-reverse database , were set to 0 . 01 , minimum peptide length was set to 7 , minimum number of peptides for identification and quantitation of proteins was set to one which must be unique . The ‘match-between-run’ option ( 0 . 7 min ) was used , which helps improve the protein identifications especially for our single-individual samples . All proteins labelled as contaminants , reverse or only identified by site were excluded and proteins with scores less than 70 were removed . After the filtering , the dataset contained 519 proteins . Quantitative analysis was performed using iBAQ values . Intensity-based absolute quantification ( iBAQ ) is the quotient of sum of all identified peptides and the number of theoretically observable peptides of a protein ( Schwanhäusser et al . , 2011 ) . Analyses of dataset characteristics were performed in Perseus v1 . 6 . 15 . 0 ( Tyanova et al . , 2016b ) , R 3 . 6 . 1 ( R Development Core Team , 2013 ) and Matlab R2020b ( Figures 2 and 3 ) . Differences in protein numbers among the sample types were analyzed with a negative binomial model , using the function nb . glm from the R-package MASS 7 . 3–53 ( Venables and Ripley , 2002 ) . Proteome variability per sample type , as measured by the coefficient of variation of the iBAQ abundance of each protein when present , was analysed with a generalized linear model with gamma distribution and log-link with the R-package LME4 ( 1 . 1–26 ) ( Bates et al . , 2015 ) . The package multcomp 1 . 4–15 was used for post-hoc testing for both models . Pearson correlation tests were used to check whether obtained protein number correlates with the sample volume . Because significant correlation was found , all further analyses were done separately for the individual samples that have small volume , and colony samples that have larger volume . Principal component analysis was run in Matlab on raw iBAQ values , for both the individual and the colony datasets . Metric for self-similarity ( S ) within and across samples was calculated in Matlab2020b ( https://github . com/dradri/variation2021; LeBoeuf , 2021; copy archived at swh:1:rev:4a620922992272317f3cedad3dae6e60871cb282 ) as follows: pairwise standardized Euclidean distances ( dissimilarities , D ) were calculated between each pair of samples based on square-root transformed and median subtracted protein abundances; these dissimilarities were averaged for each sample with the other samples within type D¯with∈ and with the samples of the other type D¯across and divided by the average dissimilarity to all other samples . Thus , self-similarity was calculated as:S=|D¯within−D¯acrossD¯all| To establish the proteins whose abundance differs significantly between sample types , samples were subdivided according to three main comparisons ( Figure 1 ) : Young vs . Mature colonies from the field , young colonies in the Field vs . Lab six months later , and individual Nurses vs . Foragers in the lab . In addition , the extent of spatial effects was analyzed for the field-collected Young vs . Mature dataset by dividing the sampling locations to two areas ( East vs . West ) . For the colony data , the differing sample volumes may account for a small proportion of the significant differences in the Young vs . Mature comparison , and to lesser extent in the Field vs . Lab comparison , where sample volume is collinear with the sample type . Our analyses may miss some of the proteins more abundant in the young field collected colonies which have the smallest sample volumes . Quantitative proteomic comparisons between sample types were performed independently with three different approaches to robustly identify significantly differing proteins: ( Szathmáry , 2015 ) classical frequentist t-tests , ( Queller , 1992 ) linear models with empirical Bayes variance correction , and ( Hamilton , 1963 ) machine-learning paired with modified Shapley values . Our approach is designed to be at the same time conservative and to find most of the differing proteins among our comparisons of the trophallactic fluid . The frequentist t-tests are the most conservative , and they miss some interesting proteins due to their strict model expectations that allow only to use the most common proteins . The empirical Bayes approach to cope with sample variance is a more flexible method that allows use of the entire dataset , finding important hits also among the rarer proteins , although the high amount of missing values , where iBAQ equals zero , makes the model less powerful for these proteins ( Kammers et al . , 2015 ) . The machine learning approach paired with modified Shapley values , although less well explored in the current proteomics literature , is promising for its ability to find multivariate patterns that the other methods miss , and results in interpretable classification . For each comparison , we report the full results of all three analyses in Supplementary file 2 ( significantly differing proteins only ) and Supplementary files 3-5 ( all results ) . Our results and discussion sections focus on the proteins that appear significantly different based on two out of three analysis methods ( Figure 5 ) . Within each dataset only proteins present in over 70 % of the samples were analyzed . Out of an original 519 proteins , the final datasets for each comparison contained the following number of proteins: Young vs . Mature , 172; Field vs . Lab , 137; and Nurse vs . Forager , 136 . All data were log2 transformed and median-centered , and missing data were imputed by random sampling from normal distribution with 2SD downward shift and 0 . 3 width for each sample . For colony datasets , we used the permutation-based FDR of 0 . 05 , and for the single individual dataset that contained more borderline-significant proteins , we used a more stable Benjamini-Hochberg FDR with a stricter threshold of 0 . 01 . S0 parameter ( similar to fold-change ) was set to two for all analyses . All comparisons were run as two-sample t-tests , with the Field vs . Lab as paired . For the individual dataset , the combined effects of colony identity and behavioral role ( Nurse vs . Forager ) and their interaction were analyzed with two-way ANOVA , with Benjamini-Hochberg FDR corrections performed in R with the base R 3 . 6 . 1 command ‘p . adjust’ . Both factors were also analyzed separately with multiple- and two-sample t-tests ( for colony identity and behavioral role , respectively ) . To allow comparison to the other statistical methods , only the simple Nurse vs . Forager analysis without the interaction was used for combining the lists of significantly different protein abundances . Our balanced sampling guarantees the results of this simpler model are robust enough to find the most descriptive proteins for nurse and forager trophallactic fluid , even when the more complex interactive patterns are lost . We implemented LIMMA ( Linear Models for Microarray Data ) , a method for two-group comparison using empirical Bayes methods to moderate the standard errors across proteins ( Kammers et al . , 2015 ) , on our score-filtered iBAQ proteomic datasets with the LIMMA-pipeline-proteomics pipeline 3 . 0 . 0 ( http://doi . org/10 . 5281/zenodo . 4050581 ) developed for R 4 . 0 . 2 . Data were median-normalized before comparison and all comparisons were run with a log2 fold change cutoff of 2 . We used random forest models ( sklearn . ensemble . RandomForestClassifier version 0 . 22 . 1 Pedregosa et al . , 2011 ) to classify samples into one of two groups for each comparison . These analyses were performed in Python 3 . 7 . 6 in a Jupyter notebook ( https://github . com/dradri/variation2021 ) . For each comparison , 10 analyses were performed , each with a different seed . For each seed , the dataset was split into 80 % training set and 20 % test set , and a model was fit , tested and accuracy computed . If accuracy was below 85% , hyper-parameter tuning was performed with GridSearchCV ( sklearn 0 . 22 . 1 ) , and the model re-fit . A seed and its corresponding model were not retained for further analysis if accuracy could not be improved above 75 % . Accuracies for East vs . West ranged from 33 to 89% and over 20 seeds , only one could be improved above 75 % . The typical parameters: max_depth , 3 or 5; max_features , 'auto'; min_samples_leaf , 3; min_samples_split , 8 or 12; n_estimators , 100 or 500 . Samples were classified with out-of-box scores ( Supplementary file 4 ) . The average accuracies of classification for comparisons were: Young vs . Mature , 87 %; Nurse vs . Forager , 93 %; Field vs . Lab , 91 %; East vs . West , 58 % . To understand which proteins contributed to the classification , we used SHAP ( SHapley Additive exPlanations , shap package v0 . 37 . 0 for Python 3 ) , a game theory tool that explains the output of machine learning models ( Lundberg and Lee , 2017 ) . To analyze the importance of each protein in a given comparison ( feature importance ) , we averaged the absolute value of the Shapley values per protein across the data to derive the feature importance . Then for each protein , we averaged the feature importances over each of the 10 seeded models . Proteins that have no impact on the model classification receive a feature importance value of 0 . When ranked according to average feature importance , the data had an approximate Pareto distribution with an inflection point typically at feature importance of ~0 . 15 . Thus , because there is no established cutoff for significance in this form of analysis , we chose to include as ‘significant’ in further analyses all proteins with a feature importance of >0 . 15 ( Supplementary file 5 ) . For random forest predictions , models trained on the classification between young and mature colonies were used to classify the same young colonies after 6 months in the laboratory . Out-of-box scores were averaged over five seeded models . Because little functional work has been done in ants , we analyzed gene ontology terms for the Drosophila orthologs to our genes of interest . Orthologs to C . floridanus trophallactic fluid proteins were determined with OMA ( ‘Orthologous MAtrix’ Martínez et al . , 2020 release Altenhoff et al . , 2021 ) . If no ortholog was found within OMA for a given gene , the protein sequence was protein BLASTed against Drosophila melanogaster . In some cases , no ortholog could be found . Annotations were compiled from NCBI RefSeq and UniProt annotations . GO analysis was performed using both Flybase ( Larkin et al . , 2021 ) and STRING v11 ( Szklarczyk et al . , 2019 ) . STRING was also used for protein-protein interaction and pathway analyses , including KEGG and Reactome ( SI Supplementary files 4 and 5 ) . The protein-protein interaction enrichment analysis in STRING used a hypergeometric test with Benjamini-Hochberg corrected FDR . Only 43 out of the 60 most abundant proteins had sufficient annotation for use by STRING while 44 of the 46 differentially abundant proteins had sufficient annotation ."}

In many cases , the condition is so severe that the fetus dies before , or shortly after , birth . Mutations in certain genes that control how the fetus develops are associated with holoprosencephaly . For example , mutations in components of the Hedgehog and Nodal signaling pathways , which transmit information that help cells to become specialized , increase the risk that a fetus will develop holoprosencephaly . Environmental factors , such as exposure to alcohol in the womb , are also thought to contribute to this condition . A gene known as Cdon is a component of the Hedgehog signaling pathway . In 2012 , a team of researchers reported that mice with a mutation in the Cdon gene exposed to alcohol in the womb develop symptoms similar to holoprosencephaly in humans . Here , Hong et al . – including some of the researchers involved in the previous work – set out to understand how Cdon and alcohol work together to cause holoprosencephaly in the mutant mice . First , the team exposed pregnant mice to alcohol at different times during gestation to find out when their young were sensitive to developing holoprosencephaly . This showed that the young mice were most sensitive in early pregnancy when the Nodal pathway was active in their growing bodies . Further experiments found that alcohol and mutations in Cdon change Nodal signaling in cells . Together , these findings demonstrate that exposure to alcohol in the womb works together with the mutant form of Cdon via the Nodal signaling pathway , rather than the Hedgehog pathway , to cause holoprosencephaly in mice . The causes of many common birth defects are complex and difficult to distinguish at the level of individual cases . The work of Hong et al . illuminates how multiple risk factors during pregnancy , which may not create any problems on their own , may work together to produce birth defects in the fetus . The findings also offer new ways to understand how exposure to alcohol in the womb affects the fetus . Ultimately , understanding how birth defects form could lead to new strategies to prevent them in the future .", "article": "1 Introduction Many common structural birth defects appear to arise from a complex and ill-defined combination of genetic and environmental factors ( Krauss and Hong , 2016 ) . The notion that environmental agents affect penetrance and expressivity of predisposing mutations is speculated to underlie many human congenital anomalies , but has been difficult to demonstrate . Animal models are therefore valuable , but these have been slow to emerge . Some recent successful examples are a zebrafish model of craniofacial defects ( Pdgfra mutations and fetal alcohol ) , and mouse models of scoliosis ( Notch pathway mutations plus hypoxia ) , facial clefting ( Pax3 mutations plus 2 , 3 , 7 , 8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin ( TCDD ) ) , and holoprosencephaly ( Hedgehog pathway mutations and fetal alcohol ) ( Hong and Krauss , 2012; Kietzman et al . , 2014; McCarthy et al . , 2013; Sparrow et al . , 2012; Zalc et al . , 2015 ) . Holoprosencephaly ( HPE ) is a common developmental defect in midline patterning of the forebrain and/or midface ( Muenke and Beachy , 2001 ) . HPE occurs approximately once per 250 human conceptions , with an associated in utero lethality of ~97% ( Leoncini et al . , 2008; Shiota and Yamada , 2010 ) . HPE is characterized by an unbroken continuum of rostroventral midline anomalies that range from complete failure to partition the forebrain into hemispheres plus cyclopia , through progressively less severe defects including partially partitioned forebrain , single nostril , and midface hypoplasia ( Cohen , 2006; Krauss , 2007; Muenke and Beachy , 2001 ) . Development of the rostroventral midline is initiated by signals derived from the prechordal plate ( PCP ) ( Kiecker and Niehrs , 2001; Marcucio et al . , 2011 ) . The PCP produces Sonic hedgehog ( SHH ) , initiating a sequence of events that progressively patterns the forebrain and midface ( Aoto et al . , 2009; Cordero et al . , 2004; Geng and Oliver , 2009; Kiecker and Niehrs , 2001; Rubenstein and Beachy , 1998; Zhang et al . , 2006 ) . HH ligands trigger signaling by binding the primary receptor Patched1 ( PTCH1 ) . In the absence of ligand , PTCH1 constrains the activity of a second membrane protein , Smoothened ( SMO ) . HH binding inhibits PTCH1 function , allowing SMO-dependent signals to activate GLI transcription factors and pathway-specific gene expression . HH ligand availability and signal reception are also regulated by a series of co-receptors and additional HH-binding proteins , including CDON , BOC , GAS1 , and LRP2 ( Beachy et al . , 2010; Kong et al . , 2019; Lee et al . , 2016; Petrov et al . , 2017; Willnow and Christ , 2017 ) . The PCP develops from the anterior primitive streak ( APS ) under the influence of Nodal pathway signaling ( Robertson , 2014; Schier , 2009; Shen , 2007 ) . Therefore , the Nodal pathway is developmentally upstream of the HH pathway in rostroventral midline patterning . Consistent with this conclusion , defective Nodal signaling at the primitive streak stage of development leads to defects in HH signaling and HPE ( Krauss , 2007 ) . Nodal is a TGFβ superfamily member and signals through a receptor complex including the type I and type II receptors , ALK4 and Activin receptor IIA/B ( ActRIIA/B ) , and a GPI-linked co-receptor , TDGF1 ( also called Cripto ) ( Robertson , 2014; Schier , 2009; Shen , 2007 ) . Receptor activation results in phosphorylation of the transcription factors SMAD2 and SMAD3 , and activation of genes required for PCP induction ( Robertson , 2014; Schier , 2009; Shen , 2007 ) . Among these genes are Foxa2 and Gsc ( Ang and Rossant , 1994; Belo et al . , 1998; Filosa et al . , 1997 ) . Nodal signaling also induces expression of Lefty1 and Lefty2 , which encode secreted inhibitors of the pathway that bind to TDGF1 and Nodal itself ( Robertson , 2014; Schier , 2009; Shen , 2007 ) . The etiology of HPE is complex , involving both genetic and environmental risk factors ( Addissie et al . , 2020; Dubourg et al . , 2018; Hong and Krauss , 2018; Johnson and Rasmussen , 2010; Krauss , 2007; National Birth Defects Prevention Study et al . , 2010; Muenke and Beachy , 2001; NISC Comparative Sequencing Program et al . , 2018; Roessler et al . , 2018; Summers et al . , 2018 ) . Heterozygous , loss-of-function mutations in components or regulators of the HH , Nodal , and FGF signaling pathways are associated with HPE ( NISC Comparative Sequencing Program et al . , 2018; Roessler et al . , 2018 ) . Epidemiology of HPE is less advanced than genetic analyses , but among the environmental risk factors implicated is fetal alcohol exposure ( Abe et al . , 2018; Cohen and Shiota , 2002; Croen et al . , 2000 ) , though this is not always observed ( Addissie et al . , 2020 ) . A full range of clinical phenotypes is seen in both sporadic and familial HPE ( Muenke and Beachy , 2001; Solomon et al . , 2010 ) . Many mutation carriers in pedigrees lack clinical manifestation , and many apparently sporadic cases have inherited a mutation from a minimally affected parent ( Lacbawan et al . , 2009; Solomon et al . , 2012 ) . It is likely , therefore , that HPE-associated mutations are not sufficient to produce midline defects , but are the substrate on which a complex landscape of genetic and/or environmental modifiers act . Statistical analysis is consistent with a multifactorial , ‘autosomal dominant with modifier’ model , wherein the penetrance and expressivity of a heterozygous driver mutation is graded by the modifier landscape ( Dubourg et al . , 2018; Hong and Krauss , 2018; Roessler et al . , 2012 ) . We have modeled this phenomenon in mice with high fidelity . CDON encodes a multi-functional co-receptor , including for the HH pathway , ( Lu and Krauss , 2010; Sanchez-Arrones et al . , 2012 ) . CDON loss-of-function mutations have been identified in human HPE patients ( Bae et al . , 2011; NISC Comparative Sequencing Program et al . , 2018 ) , but such variants are relatively common in the human population . Additionally , a patient with a rare homozygous CDON mutation displayed retinal coloboma , a mild HPE-associated eye phenotype also seen in Cdon-/- mice ( Berkun et al . , 2019; Pineda-Alvarez et al . , 2011; Zhang et al . , 2009 ) . Therefore , CDON mutations likely require additional insults to contribute to HPE . Studies with mice are consistent with this conclusion . Cdon-/- mice on a 129S6 genetic background have a subthreshold defect in HH signaling and are subject to HPE induced by genetic and environmental modifiers; among the latter is ethanol ( EtOH ) ( Hong and Krauss , 2018 ) . Cdon mutation or in utero EtOH exposure individually yielded little effect on 129S6 mice . The combination , however , synergized to inhibit HH signaling in the developing forebrain and produced a complete spectrum of HPE phenotypes with high penetrance ( Hong and Krauss , 2012 ) . Furthermore , fetal EtOH induced a low penetrance of HPE in C57BL/6J mice , and this was exacerbated by heterozygosity for Shh or Gli2 ( Kietzman et al . , 2014 ) . Consistent with the notion that a threshold of HH signaling activity is rate-limiting in midline patterning , genetic removal of one copy of the negative pathway regulator , Ptch1 , rescued 129S6 Cdon-/- mice from EtOH-induced HPE ( Hong and Krauss , 2013 ) . Defective HH pathway function may be a final common mechanism for all classical forms of HPE , so these results do not prove that HH signaling is the direct synergistic target of Cdon mutation and in utero EtOH exposure . Several lines of evidence argue that EtOH itself , rather than a consequence of its metabolism , is the HPE-inducing teratogen ( Hong and Krauss , 2017 ) . In this study , we demonstrate that the window of sensitivity to EtOH-induced HPE in 129S6 Cdon-/- mice is closed by embryonic day ( E ) 7 . 5 , with the sensitivity period overlapping Nodal-mediated specification of the PCP from the APS . Furthermore , we find that CDON interacts genetically and physically with regulators of Nodal signaling . Finally , EtOH inhibits Activin/Nodal pathway signaling in vitro in mouse epiblast stem cells ( mEpiSCs ) , which have transcriptional and functional properties that resemble APS cells ( Kojima et al . , 2014; Tsakiridis et al . , 2014 ) . Together these results argue that , unexpectedly , Cdon mutation and fetal alcohol synergize to induce HPE by interfering with Nodal signaling . These results illuminate mechanisms of gene-environment interaction in a high fidelity , multifactorial model of a common birth defect . 2 Results All studies were performed with mice on a 129S6 background and are referred to only by genotype unless otherwise noted . Our model uses one-hour timed mating of Cdon+/- mice , allowing rigorous identification of a window of sensitivity for EtOH’s teratogenic effects . The standard EtOH treatment regimen involves one dose at E7 . 0 and a second dose four hours later . This results in a full range of HPE phenotypes in Cdon-/- mice with overall penetrance of ~75% ( Hong and Krauss , 2012 ) . The protocol is analogous to the original regimen developed to model fetal alcohol spectrum disorders in C57BL/6J mice , wherein ~ 19% developed HPE phenotypes ( Aoto et al . , 2008; Sulik et al . , 1981 ) . HPE phenotypes were not induced in wild type C57BL/6J mice when EtOH was administered at E6 . 5 or E7 . 5 ( Aoto et al . , 2008 ) . We have shown that EtOH is ineffective in Cdon-/- mice when administered at E8 . 0 ( Hong and Krauss , 2012 ) . To further refine the temporal window of sensitivity , we assessed the ability of EtOH to induce HPE in Cdon-/- animals when administered at E7 . 25 and E7 . 5 , with embryos examined for external HPE phenotypes at E14 . 0 . EtOH was effective at E7 . 25 , but not at E7 . 5 ( Table 1 and Figure 1 ) . EtOH itself is the HPE-inducing teratogen in this system ( Hong and Krauss , 2017 ) . The developmental processes directly perturbed by EtOH must therefore occur: 1 ) during the sensitive time window; and 2 ) prior to EtOH clearance , even if defects in midline development occur later . When administered at E7 . 0 , maternal blood EtOH levels peaked at E7 . 25 and were no longer detectable by ~E7 . 75 ( Hong and Krauss , 2012 ) . Critically , EtOH is no longer effective at E7 . 5 , a time reported to be prior to SHH expression and function in prechordal plate-mediated rostroventral midline patterning ( Echelard et al . , 1993; McMahon et al . , 2003 ) . These results argue that EtOH targets processes other than , or in addition to , HH signaling in Cdon-/- mice . Consistent with this conclusion , the time of peak sensitivity to HPE induced by the direct SMO inhibitor , Vismodegib , was E7 . 5 , 6–12 hr later than for EtOH ( Heyne et al . , 2015 ) . Both the window of sensitivity to EtOH and peak EtOH levels overlap with induction of the PCP by Nodal signaling . We previously observed that expression of Foxa2 and Gsc , two Nodal target genes that mark the APS ( from which the PCP is derived ) , was diminished at E7 . 25 in EtOH-treated Cdon-/- embryos ( Hong and Krauss , 2012 ) . Both Cdon mutation and EtOH exposure were required for this effect . Expression of Lefty2 , a direct Nodal pathway target gene , was also reduced at E7 . 25 specifically in EtOH-treated Cdon-/- embryos ( Figure 2 ) . Taken together , these results showed that the synergy between Cdon mutation and in utero EtOH exposure occurred during Nodal-dependent specification of the PCP and that reduction of Nodal target gene expression required a combination of mutation and teratogen . The observation that loss of CDON was required for the effect suggests that , in addition to its role as a SHH co-receptor , CDON functions earlier in development to promote midline patterning , potentially via the Nodal pathway . In fact , Cdon expression initiates during gastrulation and is seen in embryonic mesoderm and ectoderm ( Hong and Krauss , 2012; Mulieri et al . , 2000 ) . Mice with mutations resulting in complete loss of Nodal signaling gastrulate abnormally and die early in development , but hypomorphic pathway mutants display a range of HPE phenotypes ( Andersson et al . , 2006; Chu et al . , 2005; Lowe et al . , 2001; Nomura and Li , 1998; Schier , 2009; Shen , 2007; Song et al . , 1999 ) . To further probe the linkage between CDON and regulation of Nodal signaling , we assessed whether Cdon interacted genetically with Tdgf1 and Lefty2 , direct positive and negative regulators of the Nodal pathway , respectively . When analyzed at E10 , ~14% of Cdon-/- embryos treated with EtOH had alobar HPE and cyclopia , dying in utero by E11 ( Hong and Krauss , 2012; Hong and Krauss , 2013 ) . When studied at E14 , ~70% of such embryos displayed lobar HPE and a range of craniofacial midline phenotypes , including fused upper lip and single nostril ( Hong and Krauss , 2012; Hong and Krauss , 2013 ) . To address genetic interactions between Cdon and Nodal pathway regulators , we took advantage of the high penetrance of phenotypes at E14 and analyzed embryos at this stage for these unambiguous , easily scored phenotypes . Targeted mutations in Tdgf1 and Lefty2 ( Ding et al . , 1998; Meno et al . , 1999 ) were placed onto the 129S6 genetic background and then crossed to Cdon mutants to generate double heterozygotes . Offspring of intercrosses of these mice were further crossed and pregnant females were treated with EtOH or saline as a control . Tdgf1 is essential for Nodal signaling . Lefty2 is induced in response to Nodal signaling to provide critical negative feedback as an inhibitor of the pathway . Since CDON and EtOH may act together at the level of Nodal signaling in HPE , we predicted that removal of one copy of Tdgf1 would sensitize Cdon-/- embryos to EtOH-induced HPE . In contrast , removal of one copy of Lefty2 would be predicted to rescue Cdon-/- embryos from EtOH-induced HPE . ( Null mutations in Tdgf1 and Lefty2 result in early lethality due to strong gastrulation defects ( Ding et al . , 1998; Meno et al . , 1999 ) , so studying homozygous double mutants with Cdon is impossible . ) To permit the detection of sensitization by Tdgf1 heterozygosity , we used a dose of EtOH which we previously reported gives ~30% penetrance of HPE at E14 ( 2 . 9 g/kg ) ( Hong and Krauss , 2012 ) . With this regimen , 28% of EtOH-treated Cdon-/-;Tdgf1+/+ embryos had HPE , whereas 55% of Cdon-/-;Tdgf1+/- embryos did ( p<0 . 014 ) ( Table 2 and Figure 3 ) . With the exception of a single EtOH-treated Cdon+/-;Tdgf1+/- embryo , EtOH-treated mice of other genotypes and saline-treated control mice did not display HPE . Removal of one copy of Tdgf1 therefore sensitized Cdon-/- mice to EtOH-induced HPE . Nodal-/- and Lefty2-/- embryos have opposite defects in gastrulation and display dosage-dependent genetic interactions , with Lefty2 functioning as a negative regulator of the pathway ( Meno et al . , 1999 ) . To test for phenotypic suppression in EtOH-induced HPE , we used the standard dose of EtOH ( 3 . 48 g/kg ) for these analyses , as it results in high penetrance . All embryos with HPE at E14 display a fused upper lip , while only some show the more severe single nostril phenotype . Approximately 70% of EtOH-treated Cdon-/-;Lefty2+/+ embryos had a fused upper lip , similar to our previous findings ( Hong and Krauss , 2012; Hong and Krauss , 2013 ) , whereas 54% of Cdon-/-;Lefty2+/- embryos did , revealing a trend toward overall reduction of HPE frequency ( p=0 . 14 ) . However , while 21% of EtOH-treated Cdon-/-;Lefty2+/+ embryos had a single nostril , only 6% of Cdon-/-;Lefty2+/- embryos did ( p=0 . 04 ) ( Table 3 and Figure 4 ) . Again , EtOH-treated mice of other genotypes and saline-treated control mice did not display HPE . Therefore , removal of one copy of Lefty2 rescued a more severe form of HPE associated with EtOH treatment . Taken together , these studies revealed that the Nodal signaling components Tdgf1 and Lefty2 act as heterozygous enhancer and suppressor genes , respectively , of EtOH-induced HPE in Cdon-/- embryos . The APS is a small , transiently existing cell population , making it hard to study directly . Cultured mEpiSCs have transcriptional and functional properties resembling APS cells ( Kojima et al . , 2014; Tsakiridis et al . , 2014 ) , making them a tractable in vitro surrogate model . mEpiSCs rely on FGF2 and Activin/Nodal signaling for maintenance as self-renewing , pluripotent stem cells ( Brons et al . , 2007; Vallier et al . , 2009 ) . Activin A and Nodal use the same receptor and signaling mechanism , except that Nodal , but not Activin A , requires the co-receptor TDGF1 . Therefore , we evaluated the effects of EtOH on Activin/Nodal signaling in mEpiSCs . A direct readout of Nodal signaling activity is receptor-mediated phosphorylation of SMAD2 at its C-terminus ( Robertson , 2014; Schier , 2009; Shen , 2007 ) . We assessed C-terminally phosphorylated SMAD2 ( p-SMAD2C ) and total SMAD2 levels in the mEpiSC line , EpiSC9 ( Najm et al . , 2011 ) , after treatment with EtOH for 6 hr . A relatively short treatment duration was chosen because: 1 ) the in vivo model is an acute exposure regimen; 2 ) the window of sensitivity to EtOH-induced HPE is <12 hr; and 3 ) high EtOH levels last only about 10 hr in pregnant females ( Hong and Krauss , 2012 ) . EtOH dose-dependently diminished p-SMAD2C levels in mEpiSCs , without altering total SMAD2 levels ( Figure 5A , B ) . EtOH stimulates activation of the MAP kinase , JNK , in specific cell types ( McAlhany et al . , 2000; Ren et al . , 2017 ) . SMAD2 is phosphorylated in its linker region by MAP kinases ( Massague , 2003; Rezaei et al . , 2012 ) , usually leading to inhibition of SMAD2 function ( Grimm and Gurdon , 2002; Kretzschmar et al . , 1999; Lessard et al . , 2018 ) . We therefore assessed total and phosphorylated ( activated ) forms of JNK1 MAP kinase in EtOH-treated mEpiSCs . EtOH dose-dependently increased phospho-JNK1 ( T183/Y185 ) levels ( p-JNK1; Figure 5A , B ) . Consistent with EtOH-induced p-JNK1 activation , phosphorylation of the SMAD2 linker region ( p-SMAD2L ) also occurred in an EtOH dose-dependent manner , with production of p-JNK1 and p-SMAD2L correlating well ( Figure 5A , B ) . Human embryonic stem cells ( hESCs ) resemble mEpiSCs ( Pauklin and Vallier , 2015 ) . Treatment of hESC or mEpiSC cultures with the ALK4 inhibitor , SB43152 , led to reduction of Activin/Nodal target gene expression and , eventually , induction of early markers of neuroectoderm differentiation ( Chng et al . , 2010; Li et al . , 2015; Liu et al . , 2018; Vallier et al . , 2009 ) . These studies generally used time courses of days to weeks , but Vallier et al . assessed expression of five Activin/Nodal target and/or pluripotency-related genes in hESCs treated with SB43152 for 6 hr , the same amount of time we treated mEpiSCs with EtOH . Levels of Nanog , Nodal , and LeftyA mRNA were reduced by SB43152 , whereas levels of Pou5f1 ( also called Oct4 ) and Sox2 underwent little or no change ( Vallier et al . , 2009 ) . We assessed expression of these five genes in mEpiSCs treated with EtOH for 6 hr ( Figure 5C ) . Similar to SB43152-treated hESCs , EtOH-treated mEpiSCs displayed significantly reduced levels of Nanog and Nodal mRNAs , while Pou5f1 and Sox2 mRNA levels were largely unchanged . Expression of the additional SB43152-inhibitable mEpiSC markers Fgf5 and T ( Liu et al . , 2018 ) were also reduced by EtOH treatment ( Figure 5C ) . In contrast , EtOH did not alter levels of Lefty1 or Lefty2 in mEpiSC cultures ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) . As these are known Activin/Nodal target genes , this result might be related to differences in SB43152 vs . EtOH treatment , or differences in half-lives of these mRNAs in human vs . mouse cultures . Therefore , acute EtOH treatment of mEpiSCs resulted in an inhibitory SMAD2 phosphorylation pattern and changes in gene expression similar to those induced by a direct Activin/Nodal pathway inhibitor . Induction of neuroectoderm-specific genes ( e . g . , Hoxa1 , Six1 , and Gbx2 ) was observed in hESCs treated with SB43152 for 2–6 days ( Chng et al . , 2010; Vallier et al . , 2009 ) . After 6 hr of EtOH treatment , we found a varied response , with Hoxa1 levels strongly induced , Six1 expression displaying a biphasic dose-response , and Gbx2 levels reduced ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) . Our findings argue that CDON plays an earlier role in development than its known function as a SHH co-receptor . The need for EtOH exposure to reveal this role suggests that CDON’s effects in primitive streak embryos may be redundant with other factors . The HH co-receptors BOC and GAS1 are not likely to be such factors , as Cdon;Boc;Gas1 triple knockout mice had a phenotype that is close to a complete loss of embryonic HH pathway function , but not Nodal pathway-like phenotypes ( Allen et al . , 2011 ) . LRP2 is an endocytic and auxiliary receptor for multiple morphogenetic ligands and receptors ( Willnow and Christ , 2017 ) . Lrp2-/- mice have HPE of variable penetrance and severity ( Christ et al . , 2012; Spoelgen et al . , 2005; Willnow and Christ , 2017; Willnow et al . , 2012 ) . We therefore constructed mice with mutations in Cdon and Lrp2 . Some Cdon;Lrp2 double mutants at E11 . 5 had a severe truncation of anterior head and face structures , a phenotype neither single mutant displayed ( Figure 6A ) . Double-mutant embryos studied at several stages displayed a range of phenotypes , including milder craniofacial truncation and strong HPE ( Figure 6B , C ) . Of 30 Cdon;Lrp2 double mutants scored between 20 and 37 somites , 24 ( 80% ) had HPE and 6 ( 20% ) displayed anterior truncations . Loss of anterior head structure is a more severe phenotype than that seen even in Smo mutants , which lack all HH signaling ( Zhang et al . , 2001 ) . These phenotypes – anterior truncations and HPE – are similar to those observed in mice with partial loss of Nodal pathway function ( e . g . , hypomorphic Nodal and Tdgf1 mutants , and Nodal+/-;Smad2+/- mutants , each have phenotypes that include truncation of anterior head structures and severe HPE ) ( Andersson et al . , 2006; Chu et al . , 2005; Lowe et al . , 2001; Nomura and Li , 1998; Song et al . , 1999 ) . The Cdon/Lrp2 genetic interaction is specific and selective: the Cdon paralog Boc is not expressed in primitive streak-stage embryos ( Mulieri et al . , 2002; Zhang et al . , 2001 ) , and Boc mutant mice do not synergize with Lrp2 mutants ( unpublished results ) , nor are they sensitive to EtOH-induced HPE ( Hong and Krauss , 2012 ) . CDON is a multifunctional co-receptor and promotes HH-independent signaling when associated with various other receptors and cell adhesion molecules . In addition to binding HH ligands and PTCH1 , CDON interacts with and influences signaling by classical cadherins; the Netrin receptor , Neogenin; and the WNT co-receptor , LRP6 ( Bae et al . , 2011; Bae et al . , 2009; Izzi et al . , 2011; Jeong et al . , 2014; Kang et al . , 2003; Kang et al . , 2004; Lu and Krauss , 2010; Tenzen et al . , 2006 ) . We hypothesized that CDON might work similarly in Nodal signaling . To address this possibility , we assessed whether CDON binds to Nodal receptor components . A secreted CDON ectodomain fused in-frame at its carboxy terminus with the IgG Fc region ( CDON-Fc ) was expressed in HEK293T cells with individual ectodomains of the Nodal receptor ( ActRIIA , ActRIIB , ALK4 , and TDGF1 ) fused in-frame at their carboxy termini with alkaline phosphatase ( AP ) . As positive and negative controls , SHH-N-AP and CD164-AP were used , respectively ( SHH-N is the active portion of SHH , CD164 is a cell surface sialomucin ) ( Kang et al . , 2002; Tenzen et al . , 2006 ) . The use of secreted ectodomains reduces the possibility that unknown , cell surface-bound factors promote binding or contribute directly to the complex . Conditioned medium was collected , and equivalent amounts of AP fusion proteins from conditioned media were pulled down and blotted for captured CDON-Fc . Conversely , equivalent levels of Fc were pulled down , and associated AP activity was quantified . Similar results were obtained in each pull-down: CDON-Fc interacted efficiently with TDGF1-AP , similar to the interaction between CDON-Fc and SHH-N-AP ( Figure 7A , B ) . CDON-Fc did not bind to the negative control CD164-AP , and it interacted only weakly with the AP-tagged versions of ALK4 , ActRIIA , and ActRIIB ( Figure 7A , B ) . As CDON and LRP2 interacted genetically to produce Nodal hypomorph-like phenotypes , we asked whether LRP2 , like CDON , binds to TDGF1 . The extracellular region of LRP2 harbors four repetitive modules , each comprising a cluster of complement-type repeats followed by EGF-type repeats and β-propellers . Each module is likely capable of independently binding ligands , as shown for the related receptor , LRP1 ( Croy et al . , 2003 ) . LRP2 is a huge polypeptide of 4660 amino acids , making it difficult to express in vitro . Therefore , we constructed a series of soluble ‘mini-receptors’ ( designated sR1 , sR2 , sR3 , and sR4 ) spanning virtually the entire ectodomain in four non-overlapping pieces , each fused in-frame at their carboxy termini to the IgG Fc region ( see Figure 7C ) . Each soluble ectodomain segment and TDGF1-AP were expressed in HEK293T cells and assessed for their ability to bind to each other . LRP2 binds SHH-N ( Christ et al . , 2012; McCarthy et al . , 2002 ) , so this ligand was used again as a positive control , with CD164-AP serving as a presumptive negative control . Each soluble LRP2 mini-receptor ectodomain ( i . e . , sR1 to sR4 ) pulled down SHH-N-AP , revealing that LRP2 harbors multiple SHH-N binding sites ( Figure 7D ) . These results were confirmed by expressing each ectodomain segment joined with the native LRP2 transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains ( mini-receptors R1 , R2 , R3 , and R4; Figure 7C ) in NIH3T3 cells . These cultures were incubated with recombinant SHH-N-GST fusion proteins for 2 hr , followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-LRP2 antibody recognizing all mini-receptors and western blotting with antibodies to LRP2 or GST . Again , all four mini-receptors pulled down SHH-N , whereas no pulldown of SHH-N was seen in control transfectants lacking LRP2 mini-receptors ( Figure 7—figure supplement 1 ) . Finally , we assessed LRP2 binding to TDGF1 with the soluble ectodomain binding assay . Similar to its multivalent interaction with SHH-N , the soluble LRP2 ectodomain segments sR3 and sR4 pulled down TDGF1-AP ( Figure 7D ) . Soluble LRP2 ectodomain segments sR1 and sR2 also pulled down TDGF1-AP , but greater variability in the interaction was observed , leading to p>0 . 05 ( p=0 . 14 and p=0 . 06 , respectively ) . The efficiency of LRP2 mini-receptor ectodomains to bind SHH-N-AP and TDGF1-AP was similar to that of CDON-Fc ( Figure 7D ) . 3 Discussion HPE is a common developmental disorder , but its etiology remains poorly understood . Mutations in the Nodal , HH , and FGF pathways are associated with HPE ( NISC Comparative Sequencing Program et al . , 2018 ) , but these alone are insufficient to drive aberrant development . Identifying and understanding the critical phenotypic modifiers of such mutations is important but still in its infancy . Many birth defects are thought to be caused by poorly defined interactions between genetic and environmental risk factors , but the mechanistic bases of these interactions are largely unknown ( Krauss and Hong , 2016 ) . Cdon mutation and fetal alcohol are each implicated in human HPE ( Abe et al . , 2018; Bae et al . , 2011; Cohen and Shiota , 2002; Croen et al . , 2000; NISC Comparative Sequencing Program et al . , 2018 ) , though neither may be sufficient . The Cdon mutation plus fetal alcohol model is noteworthy for its specificity and fidelity to many aspects of human HPE ( Hong and Krauss , 2012 ) . Therefore , illumination of how loss of Cdon interacts with in utero EtOH exposure provides insight into mechanisms of HPE and how fetal alcohol functions as a teratogen . The Nodal pathway is developmentally upstream from the HH pathway in patterning the rostroventral midline . While CDON is clearly a component of the HH pathway , it regulates signaling within several additional pathways as well ( Bae et al . , 2011; Bae et al . , 2009; Izzi et al . , 2011; Jeong et al . , 2014; Kang et al . , 2003; Kang et al . , 2004; Lu and Krauss , 2010; Tenzen et al . , 2006 ) . Multiple lines of evidence presented here argue that CDON also regulates Nodal signaling and that the Nodal pathway is a major point of synergistic interaction between mutation of Cdon and fetal EtOH exposure . The evidence includes: ( 1 ) EtOH-treated Cdon-/- embryos display defects in expression of Nodal target genes in the APS ( including Gsc , Foxa2 , and Lefty2 ) , whereas EtOH treatment or Cdon mutation alone do not ( Hong and Krauss , 2012; this study ) ; ( 2 ) the window of sensitivity to EtOH-induced HPE is very narrow and closed by E7 . 5 , a time reported to be prior to SHH expression and function in prechordal plate-mediated rostroventral midline patterning; ( 3 ) EtOH itself is the likely HPE-inducing teratogen and peak circulating EtOH levels coincide with Nodal signaling in the APS; ( 4 ) Cdon interacts genetically with the critical Nodal pathway factors Tdgf1 and Lefty2 in EtOH-induced HPE; ( 5 ) acute EtOH treatment dose-dependently diminishes p-SMAD2C and elevates p-SMAD2L levels , and inhibits Activin/Nodal-dependent gene expression , in mEpiSCs; ( 6 ) Cdon;Lrp2 double mutants display phenotypes similar to mice with hypomorphic Nodal pathway mutations , including anterior truncations , a phenotype not seen in mice lacking all HH signaling; and ( 7 ) CDON and LRP2 both bind efficiently to TDGF1 , an essential component of the Nodal receptor . We note that although EtOH inhibited p-SMAD2C production in mEpiSCs , and diminished expression of Nodal target genes in both mEpiSCs and Cdon-/- embryos , we have not yet demonstrated that EtOH inhibits p-SMAD2C production in embryos; additional work is therefore required to show the mechanisms in vitro and in vivo operate at the same level . Similarly , analysis of Nodal signaling in Cdon;Lrp2 double mutant embryos requires study . Together our findings are consistent with the following model: CDON and LRP2 function with overlapping or compensatory roles to regulate Nodal pathway signaling in the APS during induction of the PCP . Brief exposure of Cdon-/- embryos to EtOH during this period transiently and partially inhibits Nodal pathway activity . While all the mice successfully gastrulate , they emerge from this period predisposed towards development of HPE in a stochastic manner . If HH signaling strength fails to reach a required threshold early during rostroventral midline patterning , at the PCP stage , the outcome is alobar HPE and cyclopia; if it occurs at later stages of development , the outcomes are progressively less severe . Aspects of the model will require additional experimentation , but it is logically consistent with the synergistic effects of fetal alcohol and Cdon mutation within a narrow window of sensitivity , and also with the ‘mutation plus modifier’ view of human HPE . Our findings do not exclude that EtOH may also target HH signaling in Cdon-/- mice , but they are consistent with Nodal signaling being a major target of EtOH in HPE . The specific mechanisms whereby acute EtOH treatment reduces expression of Nodal target genes in the APS of Cdon-/- mice and diminishes Activin/Nodal signaling in mEpiSCs are not known . EtOH itself , rather than consequences of its oxidative metabolism , is very likely the HPE-inducing teratogen ( Hong and Krauss , 2017 ) . An alternative mechanism to metabolism-based toxicity is that EtOH itself functions to perturb cell membranes via its hydrophobicity ( Lyon et al . , 1981; McKarns et al . , 1997 ) . One possibility is that EtOH’s hydrophobic nature perturbs trafficking of Nodal receptor components or their stable assembly at the cell surface . TDGF1 is a GPI-linked protein , so might be especially vulnerable to hydrophobic membrane perturbation . However , exogenously provided Activin A is the major activator of SMAD2 in cultured mEpiSCs , and Activin does not require TDGF1 to signal through ActRII/ALK4 . EtOH reduces p-SMAD2C levels in these cultures , so TDGF1 may not be a direct critical target of EtOH . Nevertheless , mEpiSCs endogenously express Nodal ( Kojima et al . , 2014 ) , which does require TDGF1 , and its contribution to SMAD2 signaling in these cultures is not fully clear . Additionally , EtOH activates JNK1 in mEpiSCs , with a corresponding increase in p-SMAD2L levels . Phosphorylation of SMAD2 by MAP kinases is generally inhibitory to SMAD2 activity , independent of p-SMAD2C phosphorylation status ( Massague , 2003; Rezaei et al . , 2012 ) , so EtOH appears to promote or inhibit multiple signals that converge on SMAD2 phosphorylation . CDON regulates several signaling pathways , but it has not previously been implicated in Nodal signaling . How CDON functions to regulate Nodal signaling is of obvious interest . Cdon;Lrp2 double mutant mice display phenotypes that resemble Nodal pathway hypomorphs , and CDON and LRP2 each bind to TDGF1 . Therefore , as with the effects of EtOH , TDGF1 is a possible point of regulation . One potential mechanism is that CDON and LRP2 might function as components of a larger Nodal receptor complex , contributing via interaction with TDGF1 . Alternatively , they may work with TDGF1 in processing and trafficking of Nodal or other receptor components , or play a role in processing and trafficking of TDGF1 itself ( Constam , 2009 ) . There is evidence in other systems that CDON and LRP2 can act in such a manner . LRP2 is best understood as an endocytic receptor that controls internalization and intracellular trafficking of both soluble and membrane-bound proteins , including PTCH1 , the Na+/H+ exchanger NHE3 , and the intrinsic factor receptor , Cubilin ( Willnow and Christ , 2017 ) . Furthermore , CDON regulates subcellular localization of N-cadherin during neural crest migration in zebrafish ( Powell et al . , 2015 ) . Similarly , the Drosophila orthologs of CDON act not only as co-receptors for HH , but in trafficking of the primary HH receptor , PTC ( Zheng et al . , 2010 ) . Another possibility is in regulation of cell-cell contact and adhesion . CDON is localized to sites of cell-cell contact and functions with N-cadherin in cell adhesion-dependent signaling ( Kang et al . , 2003; Lu and Krauss , 2010 ) . In zebrafish , a positive feedback loop exists between Nodal signaling , E-cadherin expression , and duration of cell-cell contact , that directs PCP specification at the expense of endoderm specification ( Barone et al . , 2017 ) . It is conceivable that CDON could play a role in adhesion-mediated , higher order regulatory events like this as well . These varied potential mechanisms are not mutually exclusive . Our findings offer insight into how Cdon mutation synergizes with fetal alcohol in mice to produce a wide spectrum of HPE phenotypes , closely resembling the complex etiology and variable outcomes seen in humans at the population level . A combination of approaches , including window of sensitivity studies , genetic interactions in mice , and in vitro analyses revealed that , unexpectedly , a major point of synergy is at the level of Nodal signaling . These findings illuminate gene-environment interactions in the causation of a common birth defect , expand understanding of alcohol teratogenesis , and serve as a conceptual framework for additional developmental anomalies . 4 Materials and methods All animal procedures were conducted in accordance with institutional guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals as approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee ( IACUC ) of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and according to Max-Delbruck-Center guidelines following approval by local authorities ( X9007/17 ) . B6 . 129P2-Lefty2tm1Hmd mice were provided by Hiroshi Hamada . Tdgf1 mutant mice ( Cripto-LacZ mice ) were provided by Michael Shen . Both strains were transferred onto the 129S6/SvEvTac ( 129S6 ) background with the Taconic Speed Congenic Program , by backcrossing and mapping with the 1450 SNP array . Mice used for these experiments were estimated to be over 98% 129S6/SvEvTac background . These lines were crossed with Cdon+/tm1Rsk ( Cdon+/- ) mice on the 129S6 background ( Cole and Krauss , 2003; Hong and Krauss , 2012 ) to generate 129S6 . Cdon+/-;Lefty2+/- and 129S6 . Cdon+/-Tdgf1+/- double mutant mice . Because Cdon and Tdgf1 are both located on chromosome 9 , Cdon+/-;Tdgf1+/- mice were crossed with wild type mice and offspring screened for those that carried a recombinant chromosome 9 carrying both Cdon and Tdgf1 mutant alleles . Offspring of intercrosses of these mice were further crossed ( see Tables 2 and 3 for details ) and pregnant females treated with EtOH or saline as a control ( Hong and Krauss , 2012 ) . Briefly , two- to three-month old mice were mated for one hour in the dark and plugged females were collected . The time of the plug was designated as embryonic day ( E ) 0 . 0 . Pregnant female mice were injected intraperitoneally twice with 15 μl per g body weight of solution of 30% EtOH in saline ( 3 . 48 g/kg ) at E7 . 0 and again 4 hr later . For window-of-sensitivity experiments , pregnant females were treated similarly , except the initial dose was given at E7 . 25 or E7 . 5 . For studies involving Cdon;Tdgf1 mutants , a lower dose of ethanol ( 25% EtOH in saline , 2 . 9 g/kg ) was used . Saline injections were used as controls throughout . Mice with targeted gene disruption of Lrp2 ( Lrp2tm1Her ) have been described ( Willnow et al . , 1996 ) . Lrp2+/tm1Her ( Lrp2+/- ) mice were kept on the C57BL/6N genetic background and crossed with Cdon+/- mice on the C57BL/6N genetic background . Offspring were further intercrossed , and Lrp2+/-;Cdon+/- mice were subjected to timed mating to collect embryos at the depicted embryonic day . Neither Cdon-/- mice nor Lrp2-/- mice on the C57BL/6N display anterior truncation phenotypes . Whole mount RNA in situ hybridization was performed according to standard protocols ( Hong and Krauss , 2012 ) . Briefly , embryos were dissected out and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) , dehydrated through a graded methanol series , and stored at −20°C . Rehydrated embryos were treated with 10 μg/ml proteinase K ( Qiagen ) in PBS , 0 . 1% Tween-20 ( PBST ) according to stage . Embryos were rinsed with PBST , post-fixed and hybridized with digoxygenin ( DIG ) -labeled probe in hybridization mix ( 50% formamide , 1 . 3x SSC pH 5 . 0 , 5 mM EDTA , 50 μg/ml yeast tRNA , 100 μg/ml heparin , 0 . 2% Tween-20 , and 0 . 5% CHAPS ) overnight at 65°C . They were washed , blocked with 2% Roche blocking reagent , 20% heat-inactivated lamb serum in Tris-buffered saline with 0 . 1% Tween-20 ( TBST ) and incubated with alkaline phosphate-conjugated anti-DIG antibody ( 1:2000 , Roche ) in blocking buffer overnight at 4°C . After washing with TBST and NTMT ( 100 mM NaCl , 100 mM Tris pH9 . 5 , 50 mM MgCl2 , and 0 . 1% Tween-20 ) , embryos were stained with BM Purple AP substrate ( Roche ) in the dark . Stained embryos were cleared in 80% glycerol and photographed with a Jenoptik ProgRes C3 camera attached to Nikon SMZ 1500 stereomicroscope . Captured images were assembled by Helicon Focus software ( Helicon Soft ) . Mouse epiblast stem cells ( EpiSC9 cells ) were obtained from Jianlong Wang , authenticated by robust expression of pluripotency markers , and confirmed to be negative for mycoplasma infection . EpiSC9 cells were cultured as described ( Huang et al . , 2017 ) . Briefly , cells were cultured on 0 . 1% fibronectin-coated plates ( MilliporeSigma , 10 μg/ml/cm2 ) in N2B27 media supplemented with 20 ng/ml Activin A ( R and D Systems ) and 12 ng/ml Fgf2 ( R and D Systems ) . Media were changed daily . EpiScs were treated with EtOH for six hours in fresh EpiSC media with supplements . For protein analysis , cells were harvested with RIPA buffer plus protease inhibitor ( Sigma ) and phosphatase inhibitor ( Sigma ) . Western blotting was as described ( Bae et al . , 2009 ) . Images were scanned and quantified using ImageJ software . Statistical significance was calculated using Student’s t-test and a cutoff of p<0 . 05 . Primary antibodies used for western blot: SMAD2 ( Cell Signaling #5339 ) , p-SMAD2C ( Cell Signaling #3108 ) , p-SMAD2L ( Cell Signaling #3104 ) , JNK ( Cell Signaling #9252 ) , p-JNK ( Cell Signaling #9251 ) , and GAPDH ( Cell Signaling #97166 ) . For mRNA analysis , total RNA was extracted from EpiSCs using the RNAeasy kit ( Quiagen ) . Reverse transcription and cDNA production were performed with Superscript III first strand synthesis system ( Invitrogen ) . qPCR was performed using iQ SyBR green supermix ( BioRad ) on an iCycler iQ5 ( BioRad ) . Gene expression levels were normalized to Gapdh . Expression vectors encoding soluble , tagged forms of CDON , SHH-N , CD164 , ActRIIA , ActRIIB , ALK4 , TDGF1 , and LRP2 , and LRP2 mini-receptors that encoded the LRP2 transmembrane and intracellular domains , were constructed by standard methods; details are available on request . HEK293T cells were obtained from ATCC , confirmed to be negative for mycoplasma infection , and cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS and 1x Penicillin/Streptomycin . HEK293T cells in 10 cm dishes were transfected with a total of either 2 or 3 μg of plasmid vectors using Effectene reagent ( Qiagen ) . Media were changed to 2% FBS two days after transfection . Conditioned media were harvested five days afterwards . Soluble fusion proteins in conditioned media were quantified by dot blotting with human IgG Fc protein ( Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories ) as a standard , and by alkaline phosphatase ( AP ) enzyme activity using AP yellow liquid substrate ( Sigma ) . For analysis of CDON-Fc interactions with soluble AP-tagged proteins , the factors were coexpressed in HEK293T cells . For Fc pull down and AP activity assays with CDON-Fc , soluble fusion proteins were incubated with protein G agarose beads ( Roche ) for 2 hr at 4°C . For analysis of soluble LRP2-Fc mini-receptors interactions with soluble AP-tagged proteins , LRP2 sR1-sR4 and the AP-tagged counterparts were generated separately in individual transfections and CM mixed together . Pull down complexes were washed five times with ice-cold HNTG buffer ( 20 mM HEPES pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 1% Triton X-100 , 10% glycerol ) . Endogenous AP was inactivated by heat inactivation . AP activity in pull-down complexes was measured using AP yellow liquid substrate ( Sigma ) . For AP pull down followed by western blot analysis , soluble fusion proteins were incubated with anti-AP conjugated agarose beads ( Sigma ) overnight at 4°C . Pull-down complexes were washed five times with HNTG buffer , eluted from the beads by boiling , and separated by SDS-PAGE . Antibodies used for western blot were HRP conjugated with goat anti-human Fc . To test SHH-N interaction with membrane-bound LRP2 mini-receptors , NIH3T3 cells were transfected with the four individual LRP2 mini-receptors encoding transmembrane and intracellular domains and incubated with 20 μg/ml GST-SHH-N in the medium for two hours . Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with polyclonal LRP2 antibody directed against full-length LRP2 , and subjected to western blot analysis with anti-LRP2 and anti-GST antibodies ."}
{"doi": "elife-59709-v2", "abstract": "Maladaptive responses to stress are a hallmark of alcohol use disorder , but the mechanisms that underlie this are not well characterized . Here , we show that kappa opioid receptor signaling in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis ( BNST ) is a critical molecular substrate underlying abnormal stress responses to predator odor following heavy alcohol drinking . Exposure to predator odor during protracted withdrawal from intermittent alcohol drinking resulted in enhanced prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) -driven excitation of prodynorphin-containing neurons in the BNST . Furthermore , deletion of prodynorphin in the BNST and chemogenetic inhibition of the PFC-BNST pathway restored abnormal responses to predator odor in alcohol-exposed mice . These findings suggest that increased corticolimbic drive may promote abnormal stress behavioral responses to predator odor during protracted withdrawal . Various nodes of this PFC-BNST dynorphin-related circuit may serve as potential targets for potential therapeutic mediation as well as biomarkers of negative responses to stress following heavy alcohol drinking .", "plain language summary": "The connection between stress and alcohol use is highly complex . On one hand , there is the idea of having a drink to ‘steady the nerves’ . On the other hand , in alcoholics , abnormal responses to stress often accompany heavy drinking . In this case , it remains unknown whether stress cause excessive drinking , or vice versa . Areas of the brain that normally help respond to stress work differently in long-term , heavy drinkers . One example is a structure called the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis ( BNST ) , which is over-active in anxiety disorders and is also associated with some of the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal . The mechanism behind both problems is thought to be a specific ‘signaling system’ that is activated by a small molecule called dynorphin . Previous research into the effects of dynorphin was performed either in the context of alcoholism or of anxiety disorders , but it was not known if there was a connection between the two . Therefore , Hwa et al . wanted to determine how prolonged alcohol use might affect responses to stress , and whether dynorphin signaling plays a role . To model long-term alcohol use in the laboratory , a group of mice was given free access to alcohol every other day , ensuring that they developed the mouse equivalent of a drinking habit . After six weeks , these ‘heavy drinkers’ went through a period of abstinence , mimicking alcohol withdrawal . Then , the mice were stressed by exposing them to a chemical that smelled like a fox , one of the mice’s predators in the wild . When mice smell predators , they normally respond by fleeing from the area and digging up debris to defend itself . As expected , the control mice in this study , which did not drink alcohol , did just that . In contrast , the heavy drinkers largely ignored the predator scent by not digging and even spent time hanging around the area that smelled like the predator . Blocking dynorphin-induced signaling in the alcoholic mice , either using a drug or by deleting the gene that codes for dynorphin , reset the stress response to normal , allowing these mice to avoid the predator and dig as normal . Furthermore , measuring the electrical activity in the brain revealed that the BNST was abnormally active in alcohol-drinking mice , driven by signals from another part of the brain , the prefrontal cortex . This reveals part of the circuitry in the brain responsible for the connection between alcohol withdrawal and the stress response . These results shed new light on the biological mechanisms underpinning the relationship between alcohol use and stress . In the future , these could be used to determine why heavy drinking can overlap with anxiety disorders , or to develop new treatments that would help recovering alcoholics cope better with stress .", "article": "1 Introduction Alcohol abuse exacts a tremendous toll on society , and long-term drinking can dysregulate stress systems in the brain . Prolonged alcohol drinking and withdrawal experiences result in enhanced responsiveness and behavioral sensitivity to stress during protracted abstinence ( Heilig et al . , 2010 ) . Reciprocally , clinical studies show that negative stress coping is predictive of higher levels of drinking in alcoholics ( Noone et al . , 1999 ) . As blunted responses to stress have been identified in alcohol-dependent people ( Sinha et al . , 2011 ) , it is essential to consider mechanisms by which alcohol drinking impacts stress responses during protracted abstinence . While many studies have utilized animal models to investigate how stress drives increased alcohol drinking behaviors ( Becker et al . , 2011; Gilpin and Weiner , 2017 ) , few have explored the effects of alcohol drinking on subsequent stress responsivity . Chronic alcohol exposure engages brain stress signaling systems that influence drinking behaviors in a dynamic and complex manner ( Koob and Kreek , 2007 ) . One such stress system is the neuropeptide prodynorphin ( Pdyn ) and its receptor , the kappa opioid receptor ( KOR ) , which has been studied in the contexts of both mood and alcohol use disorders ( Lutz and Kieffer , 2013 ) . Limbic structures implicated in alcohol and stress behaviors , such as the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis ( BNST ) , are rich in Pdyn and KOR ( Le Merrer et al . , 2009 ) . The BNST is an integrative hub that may mediate the negative affective state associated with chronic alcohol use and withdrawal ( Koob , 2009; Kash , 2012 ) . KORs throughout the extended amygdala and the BNST alter anxiety-like behavior in mice ( Bruchas et al . , 2009; Crowley et al . , 2016 ) and mediate stress-induced reinstatement for alcohol reinforcement ( Lê et al . , 2018 ) . In this study , we tested whether BNST KOR/Pdyn signaling regulates abnormal stress responses after long-term alcohol drinking . We employed the ethologically relevant predator odor trimethylthiazoline ( TMT ) as a stressor , which is a compound isolated from fox feces . In rats and C57BL/6J mice , TMT activates specific brain regions involved in stress , anxiety , and fear , including the BNST ( Day et al . , 2004; Asok et al . , 2013; Janitzky et al . , 2015 ) , and inactivation of the BNST blocks TMT-induced freezing ( Fendt et al . , 2003 ) . Recent work suggests that distinct neuropeptide circuits in the BNST may drive opposing emotional states ( Giardino et al . , 2018 ) , which may be dependent on inputs from cortical sites to affect stress coping behaviors ( Johnson et al . , 2019 ) . The current series of experiments investigate whether Pdyn neurons and KOR signaling in the BNST can modulate behavioral responses to stress in alcohol-exposed animals . We show that dysregulation of cortical inputs to BNST Pdyn neurons and BNST Pdyn neurons themselves underlie lasting behavioral changes to stressors that emerge after chronic drinking . This is a critical area of study , as mitigating stress responses can contribute to improved alcohol relapse outcomes . 2 Results Male C57BL/6J mice were given 6 weeks of intermittent access to alcohol ( EtOH ) , a protocol known to induce heavy voluntary drinking ( Hwa et al . , 2011 ) , before behavioral testing during protracted ( 7–10 days ) abstinence [Figure 1A] . Mice consumed high amounts of EtOH [Figure 1B] and increased their EtOH preference over time [Figure 1C] . Further , mice achieved greater than 80 mg/dl blood EtOH concentrations , indicative of intoxication , which correlated with drinking behavior [Figure 1D; R2 = 0 . 59 , p=0 . 0036] . To test stress responsivity during protracted abstinence from EtOH , mice were exposed to the predator odor TMT in the home cage ( Hwa et al . , 2019 ) . Both water ( H2O ) -drinking controls and EtOH drinking mice showed a TMT-induced increase in plasma corticosterone [Figure 1E; TMT main effect: F1 , 10=26 . 79 , p=0 . 0004 , H2O BL vs TMT t10 = 3 . 32 , p=0 . 0154 , EtOH BL vs TMT t10 = 3 . 99 , p=0 . 005] . We tracked the location of the mouse relative to the TMT and measured the time spent contacting the TMT and in the far corners [Figure 1F] . EtOH-drinking mice displayed reduced avoidance of the TMT compared to the water ( H2O ) -drinking controls during protracted abstinence [Figure 1G–H] . As an initial screen to identify altered behavior separate from avoidance , we examined stress-related and exploratory behavior in three mice per condition on a second-by-second basis [Figure 1—figure supplement 1] . Since the primary difference among stress-related activities was burying , we focused our further analyses on this typical behavior in response to noxious stimuli ( Hwa et al . , 2019 ) . Specifically , EtOH drinkers demonstrated reduced burying behavior compared to controls [Figure 1I] . At this protracted time point , another group of C57BL/6J male mice was tested in the elevated plus maze [Figure 1—figure supplement 2A] . EtOH mice showed reduced time spent in the open arms of the elevated plus maze [Figure 1—figure supplement 2B; t18 = 2 . 81 , p=0 . 0115] and equal time in the closed arms as controls [Figure 1—figure supplement 2C] . It is possible that the difference in response to TMT was driven by a change in olfaction . To determine whether olfaction was intact in the EtOH mice , peanut oil was tested as an alternative , appetitive odor . EtOH and H2O mice spent similar amounts of time contacting the peanut oil [Figure 1—figure supplement 2D–E] and in the far corners [Figure 1—figure supplement 2F] . Previous studies have shown that activation of the Pdyn/KOR system can modulate stress-induced EtOH seeking ( Lê et al . , 2018 ) , so we tested if KOR blockade could alter drinking-induced stress behavior . Systemic treatment with 5 mg/kg of the long-acting KOR antagonist norBNI 16 hr prior to TMT exposure reduced EtOH-induced increases in TMT contact compared to saline-injected EtOH mice [Figure 1G; Drug main effect F1 , 35=5 . 45 , p=0 . 0254 , EtOH main effect F1 , 35=15 . 80 , p=0 . 0003; saline H2O vs EtOH t35 = 2 . 95 , p=0 . 0113; EtOH saline vs norBNI t35 = 4 . 12 , p=0 . 0004] . NorBNI also alleviated reductions in burying behavior in EtOH mice compared to saline-injected EtOH drinkers [Figure 1I; interaction F1 , 35=9 . 70 , p=0 . 0037; saline H2O vs saline EtOH t35 = 4 . 52 , p=0 . 0001; EtOH saline vs norBNI t35 = 2 . 47 , p=0 . 0367] . Sample ethograms depict changes in burying behavior in the EtOH norBNI group compared to EtOH saline controls and identify other behaviors mice were engaged in during this test such as rearing , walking , and freezing [Figure 1—figure supplement 1] . Given the potential therapeutic relevance of targeting the protracted time point , we next focused on identifying the mechanism for this long-lasting adaptation in the brain’s dynorphin system . The BNST is a brain site known for its involvement in stress , anxiety , and addiction , and is regulated by the Pdyn/KOR system ( Crowley et al . , 2016 ) . Previous studies in rats have shown that TMT increases BNST activity using c-Fos as a marker for active neuronal populations ( Day et al . , 2004; Asok et al . , 2013 ) , so we examined this in a line of Pdyn-IRES-Cre x Rosa26-flox-stop-L10-GFP ( Pdyn-GFP ) mice ( Al-Hasani et al . , 2015 ) after intermittent EtOH or H2O consumption [Figure 2A] . TMT elicited robust dorsal BNST c-Fos immunostaining , which was greater in EtOH mice compared to H2O mice [Figure 2B–C; interaction F1 , 23=12 . 45 , p=0 . 0018; H2O non-stress ( NS ) vs TMT t23 = 6 . 51 , p<0 . 0001; EtOH NS vs TMT t23 = 10 . 13 , p<0 . 0001; TMT H2O vs TMT EtOH t23 = 3 . 92 , p=0 . 0041] . Furthermore , TMT increased expression of Pdyn GFP-expressing neurons in the BNST versus non-stressed ( NS ) mice [Figure 2D; TMT main effect F1 , 23=4 . 56 , p=0 . 0437] . Importantly , colocalization of c-Fos in Pdyn-containing cells ( BNSTPDYN ) was largest in the stressed EtOH group [Figure 2E; interaction F1 , 23=5 . 91 , p=0 . 0233; EtOH NS vs TMT t23 = 4 . 66 , p=0 . 0007; TMT H2O vs TMT EtOH t23 = 3 . 65 , p=0 . 0081] , suggesting an interaction between EtOH , Pdyn , and predator odor stress in the BNST . To determine whether EtOH history affected Pdyn/KOR expression in the BNST , a group of C57BL/6J mice underwent EtOH or H2O drinking and were exposed to TMT predator odor before the BNST was taken for fluorescent in situ hybridization with Pdyn and Oprk1 probes [Figure 2F] . Pdyn expression was heightened in the EtOH group compared to H2O group [Fig G-H , Pdyn intensity: t10 = 2 . 99 , p=0 . 0136; Figure 2I , Pdyn counts: t10 = 2 . 21 , p=0 . 0512] , but Oprk1 expression was not altered [Figure 2J] . Initial reports have identified the BNST as a mediator of stress responses to TMT in rats ( Fendt et al . , 2003 ) ; however , the role of KOR signaling in this process has not been explored . Thus , we next tested whether microinfusions of norBNI directly into the BNST would alter behavioral responses to TMT during protracted abstinence [Figure 3A–C , Figure 3—figure supplement 1] . Importantly , norBNI or PBS infusion into the BNST did not affect distance traveled during the TMT test [Figure 3D] . However , similar to systemic administration , intra-BNST norBNI reduced contact with TMT in the EtOH mice [Figure 3E; interaction F1 , 35=4 . 30 , p=0 . 0454; PBS H2O vs EtOH t35 = 3 . 29 , p=0 . 0105; EtOH PBS vs norBNI t35 = 3 . 32 , p=0 . 0105] with no effect on time spent in the far corners of the home cage [Figure 3F] . EtOH mice showed significantly less burying behavior in response to TMT compared to H2O mice , but there was no effect of drug in EtOH mice [Figure 3G; EtOH main effect F1 , 35=42 . 65 , p<0 . 001; PBS H2O vs EtOH t35 = 4 . 06 , p=0 . 0010; norBNI H2O vs EtOH t35 = 5 . 19 , p<0 . 001] . Intra-BNST norBNI did not alter behavior in the elevated plus maze [Figure 3H–I] . We next examined the synaptic activity of BNSTPDYN neurons following TMT exposure by recording spontaneous excitatory and inhibitory post-synaptic currents ( sEPSC , sIPSC ) in Pdyn-GFP mice during 7–10 days protracted abstinence [Figure 4A] . TMT increased sEPSC frequency ( Hz ) in EtOH and H2O drinkers compared to non-stressed ( NS ) mice [Figure 4B; TMT main effect F1 , 50=18 . 24 , p<0 . 0001; H2O NS vs TMT t50 = 3 . 38 , p=0 . 0028; EtOH NS vs TMT t50 = 2 . 75 , p=0 . 0167] with no alterations in sIPSC frequency [Figure 4C] . EtOH and TMT did not impact sEPSC and sIPSC amplitude [Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–B] . Increased sEPSC/sIPSC ratios also reflected heightened excitatory drive onto BNSTPDYN cells in stressed mice regardless of drinking history [Figure 4D; TMT main effect F1 , 50=23 . 61 , p<0 . 0001; H2O NS vs TMT t50 = 2 . 50 , p=0 . 0312; EtOH NS vs TMT t50 = 4 . 24 , p=0 . 0002; TMT H2O vs EtOH t50 = 2 . 25 , p=0 . 0566] . In the EtOH drinking , stressed group , there was a moderate correlation between cumulative EtOH drinking ( g/kg ) and sEPSC frequency [Figure 4—figure supplement 1C; R2 = 0 . 38 , p=0 . 1062] and sEPSC/sIPSC ratio [Figure 4—figure supplement 1D; R2 = 0 . 31 , p=0 . 1545] . We next examined if KOR played a role in driving this cellular phenotype . Systemic norBNI pretreatment reduced sEPSC frequency in BNSTPDYN cells [Figure 4E–F; norBNI main effect F1 , 34=7 . 94 , p=0 . 008 , EtOH TMT saline vs norBNI t34 = 3 . 22 , p=0 . 0056] , but not sIPSC frequency [Figure 4G] , with an increase in the sEPSC/sIPSC ratio being suppressed by norBNI in the EtOH TMT mice [Figure 4H; norBNI main effect F1 , 34=9 . 36 , p=0 . 0043; EtOH TMT saline vs norBNI t34 = 2 . 62 , p=0 . 026] . NorBNI did not alter sEPSC or sIPSC amplitude in stressed mice [Figure 4—figure supplement 1E–F] . These ex vivo experiments demonstrate that exposure to stress and EtOH induces KOR-mediated alteration of synaptic transmission in the BNST . We then tested if dynorphin produced in the BNST played a role in behavioral changes following EtOH and TMT , as we have previously shown that BNST Pdyn can modulate synaptic transmission in the BNST ( Crowley et al . , 2016 ) . Pdyn was deleted from the BNST using the Pdynlox/lox mouse line ( Bloodgood et al . , 2020 ) via AAV Cre-GFP microinfusions [Figure 5A–B , Figure 5—figure supplement 1] . Pdyn deletion in the BNST did not alter EtOH consumption [Figure 5C–D; Time main effect F17 , 323=3 . 28 , p=0 . 0095; Cumulative EtOH drinking ( g/kg ) per group: t19 = 0 . 23 , p=0 . 8181] or preference [Figure 5E–F; Time main effect F17 , 323=4 . 09 , p=0 . 0019; average EtOH preference per group: t19 = 0 . 10 , p=0 . 9221] . EtOH history moderately augmented distance traveled in the TMT test [Figure 5H; EtOH main effect F1 , 37=6 . 20 , p=0 . 0174] , but Pdyn deletion was not a factor in this difference . EtOH mice with BNST Pdyn deletion suppressed EtOH-related increases in TMT contact [Figure 5G , Figure 5I; EtOH main effect F1 , 37=7 . 31 , p=0 . 0103 . GFP H2O vs EtOH t37 = 2 . 93 , p=0 . 0347] , and they increased their burying behavior compared to control EtOH mice [Figure 5K; interaction F1 , 37=4 . 51 , p=0 . 0405 . EtOH GFP vs EtOH Cre-GFP t37 = 3 . 91 , p=0 . 0419] . Importantly , there were no effects of Pdyn deletion in H2O drinkers on TMT response , nor were there effects in the elevated plus maze [Figure 5L–M] . These findings demonstrate a role for BNST Pdyn/KOR in regulating specific behavioral responses impaired by long-term EtOH drinking . Given that we have previously reported increased glutamatergic transmission in the mPFC following acute TMT exposure ( Hwa et al . , 2019 ) and recent reports from the Radley lab indicated a key role in PFC inputs to the BNST in stress regulation , we next wanted to investigate if EtOH and TMT together may strengthen the functional connection between mPFC and BNST Pdyn neurons . To do this , we injected an AAV encoding channelrhodopsin ( ChR2 ) into the mPFC of Pdyn-GFP mice [Figure 6A] and measured BNST cell responses to photostimulation of this pathway using slice electrophysiology [Figure 6B] . A large proportion of BNSTPDYN neurons were light responsive after TMT in both H2O and EtOH mice , whereas non-stressed H2O mice had mostly non-responsive cells [Figure 6C; Χ23 = 21 . 43 , p<0 . 0001] . Similarly , EtOH mice had larger monosynaptic optically-evoked EPSC ( oEPSC ) amplitudes following TMT compared to H2O mice and non-stressed EtOH mice [Figure 6D; interaction F1 , 33=4 . 74 , p=0 . 0367; H2O non-stress ( NS ) vs EtOH + TMT t33 = 3 . 70 , p=0 . 0047; EtOH NS vs EtOH + TMT t33 = 4 . 50 , p=0 . 0005] , with no effects on paired pulse ratio [Figure 6E] . Both AMPA and NMDA peak amplitudes were greater in BNSTPDYN EtOH TMT mice compared to unstressed EtOH mice and H2O mice [Figure 6F–G; AMPA peak amplitude: TMT main effect F1 , 34=22 . 03 , p<0 . 0001; H2O NS vs EtOH + TMT t34 = 4 . 28 , p=0 . 0009; EtOH NS vs EtOH + TMT t34 = 4 . 82 , p=0 . 0002 . NMDA peak amplitude: TMT main effect F1 , 34=12 . 09 , p=0 . 0148; H2O NS vs EtOH + TMT t34 = 3 . 13 , p=0 . 0213; EtOH NS vs EtOH + TMT t34 = 3 . 27 , p=0 . 0148] . There was also an increase in the AMPA/NMDA ratio in the EtOH TMT mice [Figure 6H; TMT main effect F1 , 34=8 . 12 , p=0 . 0074; EtOH NS vs EtOH + TMT t34 = 2 . 89 , p=0 . 0132] , suggesting alcohol drinking may prime the synapse for AMPA receptor recruitment , further contributing to aberrant glutamate signaling and stress reactions . In addition , the EtOH TMT mice were also more resistant to synaptic depression of oEPSC amplitude in response to repeated 1 Hz oEPSC pulses , suggesting alterations in short-term plasticity [Figure 6I–L; interaction F27 , 351=1 . 83 , p=0 . 0080; Pulse 3: EtOH NS vs EtOH + TMT t22 . 81=3 . 21 , p=0 . 0234; H2O + TMT vs EtOH + TMT t18 . 81=3 . 40 , p=0 . 0180; Pulse 4: EtOH NS vs EtOH + TMT t23 . 99=3 . 95 , p=0 . 0036] . We next wanted to compare this mPFC-BNST pathway with another known glutamatergic input , so ChR2 was injected into the basolateral amygdala ( BLA ) in another group of Pdyn-GFP mice for slice recordings [Figure 6—figure supplement 1A] . The BLA input to the BNST is large , as most cells were responsive to photostimulation in all groups [Figure 6—figure supplement 1B] . In contrast to the mPFC-BNST pathway , EtOH drinking and TMT exposure did not affect BLA-BNST oEPSC amplitude [Figure 6—figure supplement 1C] , paired pulse ratio [Figure 6—figure supplement 1D] , AMPA peak amplitude [Figure 6—figure supplement 1E] , NMDA peak amplitude [Figure 6—figure supplement 1F] , or AMPA/NMDA ratio [Figure 6—figure supplement 1G] . There were also no major group differences in BLA-BNST oEPSCs in response to repeated pulse trains [Figure 6—figure supplement 1H–K] . To investigate the behavioral role of the PFC-BNST pathway in vivo , we performed pathway-specific chemogenetic manipulations with designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs ( DREADDs ) . A retrograde AAV containing cre recombinase was injected into the BNST , and an AAV containing cre-inducible hM4Di-mCherry or mCherry was injected into the mPFC of C57BL/6J mice [Figure 7A–B; Figure 7—figure supplement 1] . Bath application of CNO on mPFC cell bodies infected with cre-inducible hM4Di-mCherry produced hyperpolarization of resting membrane potential [Figure 7C] and increased latency to fire action potentials [Figure 7D] . The inhibitory DREADD alone did not affect drinking behavior across the 6 weeks [Figure 7E] or short-term drinking behavior when CNO was injected versus saline [Figure 7F–H] . When exposed to TMT , hM4Di-mediated inhibition of the mPFC-BNST pathway did not alter distance traveled [Figure 7J] , but it did reduce contact with TMT in both H2O and EtOH mice [Figure 7I , Figure 7K; virus main effect: F1 , 25=5 . 37 , p=0 . 0289; no significant post-hoc differences] . Time spent in the far corners was not affected [Figure 7L] . mPFC-BNST inhibition also increased burying behavior in EtOH-drinking mice [Figure 7M; EtOH main effect: F1 , 25=13 . 80 , p=0 . 001; virus main effect: F1 , 25=16 . 47 , p=0 . 004; H2O mCherry vs EtOH mCherry t25 = 4 . 37 , p=0 . 0234; EtOH mCherry vs EtOH hM4Di t25 = 4 . 72 , p=0 . 0131] . Time spent in the open and closed arms of the elevated plus maze were also not affected by the inhibitory DREADD [Figure 7N–O] . 3 Discussion Previous articles from our laboratory have shown that wild-type and transgenic mice exhibit relatively modest intermittent EtOH drinking and preference ( Bloodgood et al . , 2020 ) compared to those reported in Hwa et al . , 2011 publication , which was likely a results of varying vivarium conditions . However , mice in this study still achieved intoxicating blood EtOH concentrations , and this intermittent schedule may be favorable over drinking levels in continuous two-bottle choice access ( Yu et al . , 2019 ) . In our hands , 6 weeks of intermittent access to EtOH affected behavioral responses to TMT predator odor . We interpret the EtOH-induced lack of avoidance of the predator odor as a maladaptive reaction to an innately stressful stimulus . While control mice displayed an array of stress behaviors in response to TMT ( i . e . freezing , grooming , stretch-attend , etc . ) , a lack of burying was a prominent behavioral feature of EtOH mice . Burying in response to an immediate threat is commonly interpreted as an innate , active coping behavior in rodents ( De Boer and Koolhaas , 2003 ) . While EtOH mice also showed increased anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze during protracted withdrawal , this group difference was eliminated following TMT exposure , as seen in our control drug/virus experiments after BNST norBNI , Pdyn deletion , and mPFC-BNST inhibition , suggesting long-lasting impact of TMT on performance in the elevated plus maze ( EPM ) . Since we chose to not use another cohort of surgerized/transgenic mice for testing in the EPM , it is important to note that testing without prior TMT exposure was a limitation . TMT can have mixed effects on time spent in the open arms of the EPM , which can be dependent on the TMT concentration ( Hacquemand et al . , 2013; McGregor et al . , 2002; Makhijani et al . , 2020 ) . This points to the EPM as a distinct , novelty-related probe , which may not be robust to differentiate EtOH-related phenotypes after a confounding TMT exposure . Using converging approaches of intra-BNST norBNI infusions and genetic deletion of BNSTPDYN using a floxed mouse line , we show that reducing Pdyn/KOR signaling at the pre- or post-synaptic level , respectively , normalizes alcohol-induced impairments in TMT behavioral responses during protracted abstinence . These results are in line with literature showing KOR antagonists can block anxiety-like behaviors precipitated by acute withdrawal from alcohol vapor ( Valdez and Harshberger , 2012; Rose et al . , 2016 ) and suppress alcohol self-administration in post-dependent rats ( Walker and Koob , 2008; Schank et al . , 2012; Kissler et al . , 2014 ) . KORs in the BNST appear to be particularly important in mediating interactions between stress and alcohol drinking , as BNST norBNI attenuates stress-induced alcohol seeking ( Lê et al . , 2018 ) and reduces alcohol withdrawal-induced 22 kHz ultrasonic vocalizations ( Erikson et al . , 2018 ) . While this previous research has established that there is critical involvement of this stress peptide system in promoting acute alcohol withdrawal behaviors , we demonstrate here that KOR is still engaged in protracted abstinence , particularly during episodes of high stress exposure . Taken together , this body of evidence suggests that KOR signaling in the BNST is a critical pharmacological target for treatment of alcohol use disorders . Our findings using c-Fos immunolabeling show that BNSTPDYN cells are synergistically engaged in responses to stressors in EtOH-drinking mice . This complements existing c-Fos work in the BNST after TMT predator odor exposure ( Day et al . , 2004; Asok et al . , 2013; Janitzky et al . , 2015 ) while newly connecting the Pdyn population with changes in stress responses following a history of EtOH drinking . As we were using a GFP reporter line to determine Pdyn-containing neurons , we also thought it was important to measure Pdyn and Oprk1 expression using fluorescence in situ hybridation . We observed that there was greater Pdyn content in EtOH mice , specifically a significant increase of Pdyn intensity and a trend towards Pdyn number . This suggests that increased c-Fos and Pdyn co-localization after EtOH exposure and stress could be due to the emergence of a larger pool of Pdyn neurons . Future studies should measure real-time engagement of BNSTPDYN neurons during TMT exposure using fiber photometry , as specific subpopulation of BNST neurons are known to exhibit TMT-elicited calcium transients ( Giardino et al . , 2018 ) . After assessing population activity of BNST PDYN/KOR after EtOH and stress and the contributions of this population to drinking-induced alterations in behavior , we performed synaptic transmission experiments on BNSTPDYN neurons during protracted abstinence from EtOH . In addition , non-stressed intermittent EtOH mice displayed modestly increased sIPSC frequency in BNSTPDYN cells . While some studies from our laboratory have reported increased sIPSC frequency in the BNST 24 hr after drinking in monkeys ( Pleil et al . , 2015 ) , others have found increased sEPSC/sIPSC ratios in C57BL/6J mice 48 hr after ethanol vapor ( Pleil et al . , 2016 ) These differences are likely the result of cell-type-specific population targeting , variations in drinking/exposure protocols , and withdrawal time points . During protracted abstinence , there were no apparent synaptic transmission differences between withdrawn mice and controls , although previous reports have found increased sEPSC frequency at this time point in female drinkers in a BNST CRF population ( Centanni et al . , 2019 ) . Rather , we found that TMT exposure increased glutamatergic transmission in BNSTPDYN neurons after EtOH and TMT , suggesting enhanced glutamatergic activity across the region . While BNSTPDYN synaptic drive did not differ between stressed H2O and EtOH mice , differences in transmission were revealed during KOR blockade with norBNI pretreatment . Altogether , while other studies have found that chronic EtOH exposure and withdrawal can impact BNST spontaneous glutamatergic and NMDAR function ( Kash et al . , 2009; Wills et al . , 2012; McElligott and Winder , 2009 ) , our findings are the first to highlight plastic shifts in response to stressors and identify pathway-specific alterations in neuropeptide signaling . The mPFC , among other brain regions , is a known source of increased glutamatergic signaling onto BNST neurons . Previous work in the lab found that both central amygdala ( CeA ) and basolateral amygdala ( BLA ) inputs to the BNST are KOR-sensitive , but mPFC inputs are KOR-insensitive ( Crowley et al . , 2016 ) . Notably , photostimulation of BLA inputs promotes anxiolysis in alcohol-naive mice ( Crowley et al . , 2016 ) . Taken together , these findings suggest a model in which increased activity of BNSTPDYN neurons promote release of Pdyn , which in turn inhibit amygdala inputs to the BNST to promote increased engagement of mPFC glutamate signaling . We have previously identified prelimbic ( PL ) layer 2/3 neurons as a population engaged in response to acute TMT using a combination of slice physiology and immunohistochemical approaches ( Hwa et al . , 2019 ) , providing converging data for engagement of this pathway by this specific aversive stimulus . However , while Pdyn/KOR signaling in the CeA appears to promote EtOH consumption ( Bloodgood et al . , 2020 ) , Pdyn/KOR signaling in the BNST did not affect EtOH drinking in our study . Our study provides valuable insight into how the synaptic strength of the mPFC to BNSTPDYN pathway may be altered by combined exposure to EtOH and stress . Indeed , we found that a higher proportion of BNSTPDYN neurons were light-responsive following stress or EtOH compared to H2O controls , suggesting that these stimuli increase connectivity between the mPFC and BNSTDYN neurons . Taking into account the observed increases in oEPSC , AMPA , and NMDA amplitudes and AMPA/NMDA ratio after the combination of EtOH and TMT , it appears that EtOH exposure primes the synapse for aberrant responses to stressors under the control of a glutamatergic , mPFC-driven mechanism . Further , with repeated stimulation pulse trains , the EtOH TMT BNSTPDYN cells show reduced short-term depression , suggesting increased fidelity and short-term plasticity in this circuit . Again , this is in line with known chronic EtOH-induced glutamate plasticity in BNST cells ( Wills et al . , 2012 ) . In contrast to the mPFC-BNST pathway , we observed no differences in the strength of BLA inputs to BNSTPDYN neurons after EtOH and stress . Since there was a stress-EtOH interaction observed from the cortical projection , we wanted to examine how inhibition of this pathway could alter behavior . In an mPFC-BNST DREADD experiment , we found that chemogenetic inhibition also improved burying behavior in EtOH mice . This was specific to TMT behavior , as the manipulation did not affect EtOH drinking or anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze . It is also possible that systemic CNO injection may impact behavior via effects on collaterals of those mPFC-BNST that project to other brain regions . This is a caveat , and intra-BNST delivery of CNO would be more direct . These combined strategies of testing synaptic strength in slice and pathway-specific manipulation of behavior provide a mechanism for how long-term drinking and stress interact to dysregulate prefrontal inputs to BNSTPDYN neurons . A recent paper from the Radley lab explored the role of the PL mPFC to BNST pathway in stress-related behaviors in rats using optogenetics ( Johnson et al . , 2019 ) . Activation of the PL to BNST circuit negatively correlated with freezing behavior , a measure of passive coping , in response to a shock prod , while photoinhibition increased freezing and decreased burying , a measure of active coping . Notably , they found that these behavioral effects were related to downstream control of the periaqueductal gray . An important future direction will be to assess the role of specific downstream projection targets of BNST Pdyn neurons , including the periaqueductal gray , in EtOH-induced alterations in TMT behavioral responses . It is also possible that excitatory local microcircuity in the BNST activates GABA neurons that inhibit ventral tegmental area GABA output signaling reward , which leads to anhedonia-like behavior and reduced stress responding . Our results illustrating aberrant responses to stress during protracted withdrawal from alcohol complement established research characterizing a more general role for the BNST in anxiety-related behaviors employing chemo- and optogenetics in mice ( Kim et al . , 2013; Jennings et al . , 2013; Marcinkiewcz et al . , 2016; Mazzone et al . , 2018; Crowley et al . , 2016 ) . Maladaptive responses to stress are a hallmark of alcohol use disorder , but the mechanisms that underlie this effect are not well characterized . Here , we show that Pdyn/KOR signaling in the BNST is a critical molecular substrate disrupting stress-related behavioral responses following heavy alcohol drinking . Further , our findings suggest that increased corticolimbic connectivity may underlie this phenomenon; thus , altered mPFC-BNST connectivity could serve as a potential biomarker of negative outcomes in alcohol use disorder . Disentangling this imbalance of corticolimbic-driven stress neuropeptide signaling may lead to the development of novel therapeutics to enhance stress coping in persons with alcohol use disorder . 4 Materials and methods Eight-week-old male C57BL/6J mice ( Jackson Laboratories , Bar Harbor , ME ) were used for behavioral pharmacology experiments . To visualize Pdyn-expressing neurons , we generated a Pdyn-GFP reporter line by crossing preprodynorphin-IRES-Cre mice ( Crowley et al . , 2016; Bloodgood et al . , 2020; Al-Hasani et al . , 2015 ) ( PdynIRES-Cre , B6;129S-Pdyntm1 . 1 ( cre ) Mjkr/LowlJ , Jackson Laboratories Stock # 027958 ) and Rosa26-flox-stop-L10a-EGFP reporter mice ( EGFP-L10a; B6;129S4-Gt ( ROSA ) 26Sortm9 ( EGFP/Rpl10a ) Amc/J , Jackson Laboratories Stock # 024750 ) . For conditional knockout of BNST Pdyn , we used the Pdynlox/lox mouse line ( Bloodgood et al . , 2020 ) . These mice were bred in the UNC facilities . All mice were group-housed for at least 3 days before being singly housed in polycarbonate cages ( GM500 , Tecniplast , Italy ) with a 12:12 hr reversed dark-light cycle with lights off at 7:00am . Mice had unrestricted access to food ( Prolab Isopro RMH 3000 , LabDiet , St . Louis , MO ) and H2O . The UNC School of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved all experiments . Procedures were conducted in accordance with the NIH Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals . Mice were given 24 hr access to a 20% ( w/v ) EtOH solution and water on an intermittent schedule ( Hwa et al . , 2011 ) . Two bottles were held in modified drinking spouts of plastic cage tops and weighed before and after daily EtOH access . A dummy cage without an animal was used to simulate fluid lost while positioning the bottles , so average fluid drip was subtracted from each mouse’s daily drinking . Mice were tested for stress reactions to TMT during 7–10 day protracted abstinence after 6 weeks of intermittent drinking . Blood EtOH concentrations were measured in a subset of mice . Tail blood was collected after 2 hr of intermittent EtOH drinking , and then centrifuged at 3000 rpm at 4°C . Separated blood plasma was stored at −20°C before analysis using the AM1 Analox Analyzer ( Analox Intstruments Ltd . , Lunenberg , MA ) . Adult mice ( >8 weeks ) were deeply anesthetized with 3–4% isoflurane in oxygen and placed into a stereotaxic frame ( Kopf Instruments , Tujunga , CA ) while on a heated pad . Isoflurane anesthesia was maintained at 1–2% during the remainder of the surgery . After sterilization with 70% ethanol and betadine , a scalp incision was made and burr holes were drilled above the target . A 1 µl Neuros Hamilton syringe ( Hamilton , Reno , NV ) microinjected the virus or drug at a rate of 0 . 1 µl/min . Coordinates for the dorsal BNST were AP +0 . 30 mm , ML +/- 0 . 95 mm , DV −4 . 35 mm from bregma . Coordinates for the mPFC were AP +1 . 70 mm , ML +/- 0 . 30 mm , DV −2 . 50 mm from bregma . Coordinates for the BLA were AP −1 . 30 mm , ML +/- 3 . 25 mm , DV −4 . 95 mm from bregma . Mice recovered for 1 week before testing . 5 mg/kg norBNI ( Cat no . 0347 , Tocris ) or saline was administered i . p . , 1 ml/100 g , 16 hr before testing to both EtOH and H2O mice . For intra-BNST norBNI microinfusions , 5 µg/µl norBNI or PBS was injected with 50 nl AAV5-CamKII-eGFP to mark the injection site . Intra-BNST administration of norBNI or PBS was a single , bilateral infusion of drug . Since animals underwent stereotaxic surgery for drug delivery , 7 days was the minimum time for post-operative recovery before TMT behavioral testing . Both 16 hr and 7 day drug pretreatment minimized handling stress prior to the predator odor exposure and allowed for KOR antagonism instead of non-specific mu opioid antagonism that occurs initially post-injection . norBNI is known for its ultra-long duration of action ( Munro et al . , 2012 ) . While we did not directly test to see if KOR antagonism was still pharmacologically effective at the time of TMT and EPM testing , previous studies have shown the effects of norBNI in the mouse tail flick test up to 28 days after administration ( Horan et al . , 1993 ) and rat intracranial self-stimulation thresholds for at least 86 days after administration ( Potter et al . , 2011 ) . Therefore , it is likely that norBNI was on board at the time of TMT testing . Pdynlox/lox mice received 300 nl AAV5-CamKII-Cre-eGFP ( UNC Vector Core , Lot 6450 ) and control AAV5-CamKII-eGFP ( Lot 4621B ) in the BNST . 300 nl AAV5-CamKIIa-hChR2 ( H134R ) -mCherry-WPRE-hGH ( Addgene , Lot CS1096 ) was injected into the mPFC or BLA of Pdyn-GFP mice for synaptic connectivity experiments in the BNST . C57BL/6J mice were injected with 300 nl AAV8-hSyn-DIO-hM4D ( Gi ) -mCherry ( Addgene , Lot 6048 ) into the mPFC and AAV2retro-SL1-CAG-Cre into the BNST for mPFC-BNST inhibition . All intracranial injections were bilateral . To test DREADD-mediated inhibition on EtOH consumption , saline and CNO were administered 20 min before EtOH drinking on two final test days . EtOH and H2O fluid consumption were measured after 1 , 4 , and 24 hr . During protracted withdrawal 7 days later , CNO was administered 20 min before the TMT test , and again 20 min before testing in the EPM , which occurred after 3 days . 3 mg/kg clozapine N-oxide ( CNO; Hello Bio , Princeton , NJ ) was dissolved in saline before i . p . administration , 1 ml/100 g , 20 min before testing . For c-Fos and histological verification , mice were deeply anesthetized with Avertin before transcardial perfusion with phosphate buffered saline and 4% paraformaldehyde . Brains were extracted 90 min following TMT exposure for c-Fos , cryoprotected , and then sliced at 45 µm on a Leica 1200S vibratome . Coronal sections of the Pdyn-GFP mice were stained for c-Fos immunofluorescence to visualize colocalization of Pdyn-containing ( GFP ) and c-Fos expressing cells . The immunofluorescence protocol for c-Fos was performed according to previous studies ( Hwa et al . , 2019 ) using tyramine signal amplification ( TSA ) . After PBS washes , 50% methanol , and 3% hydrogen peroxide , tissue was incubated in blocking buffer with 0 . 3% Triton X-100% and 1% bovine serum albumin for 60 min . Slices were then incubated at 4°C for 48 hr in blocking buffer containing a rabbit anti-c-Fos antibody ( 1:3000 , ABE457 , Millipore , Bellerica , MA ) . After washes in TNT ( 0 . 1 M Tris-HCl , 0 . 15 M NaCl , 3% TritonX-100 ) and TNB ( 0 . 1 M Tris-HCl , 0 . 15 M NaCl , 0 . 5% Perkin Elmer blocking reagent ) buffer , slices were incubated in a goat anti-rabbit horse radish peroxidase-conjugated IgG ( 1:200 , NEF812001EA , PerkinElmer , Waltham , MA ) for 30 min . After TNT washes , tissue was processed using a TSA kit with Cy3-tyramide ( 1:50 , PerkinElmer , Waltham , MA ) for 10 min . For the mPFC-BNST chemogenetic inhibition experiment , we enhanced the mCherry signal in the mPFC cell bodies and BNST terminals using a similar immunofluorescence protocol . After PBS washes , 3% hydrogen peroxide , PBS washes , and 30 min in 0 . 5% Triton X-100 , tissue was incubated in 0 . 1% Triton X-100 , 10% normal donkey serum , and 1% bovine serum albumin for 60 min . Slices were then incubated at 4°C for 24 hr in blocking buffer containing a chicken anti-mCherry antibody ( 1:500 , ab205402 , Abcam , Cambridge , MA ) . After PBS washes , tissue underwent secondary incubation for 2 hr at room temperature in PBS containing Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-chicken ( 1:200 , Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories , Inc West Grove , PA ) . For placement verification , viral injection sites were verified using a wide-field epifluorescent microscope ( BX-43 , Olympus , Waltham , MA ) . For quantification of c-Fos immunofluorescence , slices were imaged on a Zeiss 800 laser scanning confocal microscope ( Carl Zeiss , Germany ) and analyzed with Zeiss Zen 2 Blue Edition software . Using the Image Analysis Wizard in the Zen Blue software , Pdyn-GFP cells were identified as the parent classifier , and c-Fos Cy3-labeled cells were identified as the child classifer . Automatic segmentation parameters were identical for each image within each new frame drawn to delineate the dorsal BNST . Pdyn-GFP cells , c-Fos cells , and c-Fos cells nested within Pdyn-GFP cells were automatically counted for each image . Four coronal brain sections containing the bilateral BNST were stained , imaged , and analyzed for each animal . For in situ hybridization , brains were extracted 30 min following TMT exposure under isoflurane anesthesia . Tissue was flash frozen on dry ice for 15 min and stored at −80°C until sectioned for in situ hybridization . 18 µm coronal slices containing the BNST were made on the Leica CM 3050S cryostat ( Leica Biosystems , Nussloch , Germany ) at −20°C , mounted directly onto microscope slides , and stored at −80°C . In situ was performed according to the manufacterer’s protocol for fresh frozen tissue sections ( RNAscope Fluorescent Multiplex Assay; ACDbio , Newark , CA ) with the following exceptions . PBS washes following tissue fixation were extended to 5 min each and protease treatment was shortened to 15 min . Probes utilized were RNAscope Probe-Mm-Oprk1 ( Cat no 316111 ) and RNAscope Probe-Mm-Pdyn ( Cat no 318771 ) . Slides were incubated with DAPI , coverslipped with ProLong Gold ( Life Technologies ) , and imaged on a Zeiss 800 laser scanning confocal microscope . ImageJ was used to count mean intensity of fluorescence for Pdyn ( 550 channel ) and Oprk ( 647 channel ) , and the cell counter plug-in was used to hand count Pdyn-positive neurons . After verification with DAPI , cells labeled with at least three puncta were counted as containing Pdyn mRNA . Hand counts were tabulated by a blind observer . Ninety minutes following TMT , during 7–10 day protracted withdrawal , mice were sacrificed via deep isoflurane anesthesia , and coronal brain slices containing the BNST were collected according to standard laboratory protocols ( Hwa et al . , 2019; Crowley et al . , 2016; Bloodgood et al . , 2020 ) . Whole-cell voltage-clamp electrophysiological recordings were performed in dorsal BNSTPDYN cells . Pdyn-GFP-containing cells were selected based on visualization using a 470 nm LED and GFP filter . The effects of EtOH and TMT on basal synaptic transmission were assessed in voltage clamp by adjusting the membrane potential and using a cesium methanesulfonate-based intracellular solution ( 135 mM cesium methanesulfonate , 10 mM KCl , 10 mM HEPES , 1 mM MgCl2 , 0 . 2 mM EGTA , 4 mM MgATP , 0 . 3 mM GTP , 20 mM phosphocreatine , pH 7 . 3 , 285–290 mOsmol ) . Lidocaine n-ethyl bromide ( 1 mg/ml ) was included in the intracellular solution to block postsynaptic sodium currents . Neurons were held at −55 mV to assess glutamatergic synaptic transmission . In the same cell , neurons were held at +10 mV to assess GABAergic synaptic transmission . Fluctuations in current were used to determine spontaneous post-synaptic current ( sEPSC or sIPSC ) frequency and amplitude , as well as to calculate sEPSC/sIPSC ratios . Synaptic transmission experiments in BNSTPDYN cells were also performed in animals that received 5 mg/kg norBNI i . p . 16 hr prior to TMT . Electrophysiological recordings were then analyzed using Clampfit 10 . 7 software ( Molecular Devices , Sunnyvale , CA ) . For ex-vivo optogenetic experiments , tissue was evaluated for light-evoked action potentials in the mPFC . Brains were discarded and not used for further experimentation if injection sites were missed or if action potentials were not present . A blue LED ( 470 nm , CoolLed ) was used to optically stimulate release from channelrhodopsin ( ChR2 ) -containing fibers ( Crowley et al . , 2016 ) . Picrotoxin ( 25 μM ) , tetrodotoxin ( 500 nM ) , and 4-AP ( 200 μM ) were added to the aCSF to isolate monosynaptic oEPSCs with cells held at −70 mV . The intracellular solution was cesium gluconate ( 117 mM D-gluconic acid and cesium hydroxide , 20 mM HEPES , 0 . 4 mM EGTA , 5 mM tetraethyl ammonium chloride , 2 mM MgCl26H2O , 4 mM Na2ATP , 0 . 4 Na2GTP , pH 7 . 3 , 287–292 mOsmol ) . oEPSC amplitude ( pA ) was the first peak of the paired pulse ratio with a 50 ms interstimulus interval . Paired pulse ratio was calculated as the second peak amplitude divided by the first peak amplitude . Cells were held at −70 mV to isolate AMPAR-mediated current and at +40 mV for NMDAR-mediated current . In separate slices , ten 1 , 5 , and 10 Hz pulse trains were performed at −55 mV voltage clamp without the presence of ionotropic inhibitors with the cesium methanesulfonate internal solution . The nine subsequent amplitudes in the pulse train were normalized to the first peak . For DREADD validation in slice , mPFC cell bodies were identified with mCherry expression . 10 µM CNO ( Hello Bio , Princeton , NJ ) was bath applied for 10 min , and the resting membrane potential was monitored in voltage clamp . Action potential firing was assessed before and after CNO application using an increasing ramp protocol in current clamp . Time spent in contact with the TMT , far corners , and burying behavior in seconds ( s ) , and distance traveled ( cm ) were analyzed with two-way ANOVA with drug/virus and EtOH as factors . Post-hoc paired and unpaired t-tests were two-tailed and used where appropriate . In experiments where virus was injected before EtOH , cumulative 6 week alcohol intake and average ethanol preference were compared via t-test . BNST c-Fos , Pdyn-containing , and c-Fos and Pdyn colocalization were analyzed with two-way ANOVA with TMT exposure and EtOH as factors . With norBNI physiology , saline- and norBNI-injected stressed mice were compared in separate two-way ANOVA with drug and EtOH as factors . To compare proportion of light-responsive cells per condition , a Χ2 test was performed . Furthermore , optically-evoked experiments ( e . g . oEPSC amplitude ) were analyzed with two-way ANOVAs comparing TMT and EtOH exposure . Pulse trains were analyzed with repeated measures two-way ANOVA across stimulus time and condition . Alpha was set to 0 . 05 . Biological replicates throughout behavioral , immunohistochemical , and electrophysiological studies were combined . Statistical tests were analyzed with GraphPad Prism 8 ( La Jolla , CA , USA ) ."}

Recent hypotheses suggested that haematopoiesis migrated into long bones prior to the water-to-land transition and protected newly-produced blood cells from harsher environmental conditions . However , little fossil evidence to support these hypotheses has been provided so far . Observations of the humeral microarchitecture of stem-tetrapods , batrachians , and amniotes were performed using classical sectioning and three-dimensional synchrotron virtual histology . They show that Permian tetrapods seem to be among the first to exhibit a centralised marrow organisation , which allows haematopoiesis as in extant amniotes . Not only does our study demonstrate that long-bone haematopoiesis was probably not an exaptation to the water-to-land transition but it sheds light on the early evolution of limb-bone development and the sequence of bone-marrow functional acquisitions .", "plain language summary": "For many aquatic creatures , the red blood cells that rush through their bodies are created in organs such as the liver or the kidney . In most land vertebrates however , blood-cell production occurs in the bone marrow . There , the process is shielded from the ultraviolet light or starker temperature changes experienced out of the water . It is possible that this difference evolved long before the first animal with a backbone crawled out of the aquatic environment and faced new , harsher conditions: yet very little fossil evidence exists to support this idea . A definitive answer demands a close examination of fossils from the water-to-land transition including lobe-finned fish and early limbed vertebrates . To support the production of red blood cells , their fin and limb bones would have needed an internal cavity that can house a specific niche that opens onto a complex network of blood vessels . To investigate this question , Estefa et al . harnessed the powerful x-ray beam produced by the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility and imaged the fin and limb bones from fossil lobe-finned fish and early limbed vertebrates . The resulting three-dimensional structures revealed spongy long bones with closed internal cavities where the bone marrow cells were probably entrapped . These could not have housed the blood vessels needed to create an environment that produces red blood cells . In fact , the earliest four-legged land animals Estefa et al . found with an open marrow cavity lived 60 million years after vertebrates had first emerged from the aquatic environment , suggesting that blood cells only began to be created in bone marrow after the water-to-land transition . Future work could help to pinpoint exactly when the change in blood cell production occurred , helping researchers to identify the environmental and biological factors that drove this change .", "article": "1 Introduction Tetrapod long bones are among the most studied skeletal elements in the field of bone biology as they constitute a unit of reference for understanding the development and biomechanics of the appendicular skeleton ( e . g . Duboule , 1994; Fröbisch , 2008; Hall , 2008; Shubin et al . , 1997 ) . The recent discovery of fossil tetrapod trackways ( Ahlberg , 2018; Niedźwiedzki et al . , 2010 ) suggested that limbs supported weight and engaged substrate locomotion earlier than previously thought in early tetrapod evolution . Not only crucial for their biomechanical properties , long bones also host bone marrow including stem-cell niches for the production of blood cells , that is haematopoiesis ( Orkin and Zon , 2008 ) . After birth , bone marrow is the definitive haematopoietic system in mostly terrestrial mammals and many other tetrapods ( Akiyoshi and Inoue , 2012; Kapp et al . , 2018; Orkin and Zon , 2008 ) but not in fish or some aquatic tetrapods ( Akiyoshi and Inoue , 2012; Avagyan and Zon , 2016; Kapp et al . , 2018 ) . Indeed , red blood cells are produced in the supraspinal organ in the lamprey , the kidney and liver in actinopterygians ( ray-finned fish ) and some amphibians ( tadpoles and aquatic adults , Akiyoshi and Inoue , 2012 ) , and the kidney in lungfish ( Amemiya et al . , 2007; Kapp et al . , 2018 ) . Several studies proposed that the skeleton would have played a major role in hosting blood-cell production over the water-to-land transition and ( 1 ) protecting it against temperature changes ( Weiss and Wislocki , 1956 ) , ( 2 ) protecting it against potential DNA mutations induced by UV exposure on land ( Horton , 1980; Kapp et al . , 2018 ) or ( 3 ) providing a better efficiency in red-blood-cell production necessary for metabolically-demanding terrestrial locomotion and aerial respiration ( Tanaka , 1976 ) . Our study focusses on characterising the early evolution of the bone marrow and long-bone growth in fossils to contextualise these hypotheses . Tetrapod long bones are regionalised in three parts mirrored from midshaft ( Figure 1 ) : ( 1 ) the middle of the shaft is called diaphysis; ( 2 ) the metaphyses are located at each extremity of the shaft and ( 3 ) the epiphyses start above the ossification notch ( i . e . where the cortical bone stops forming ) , extend beyond the metaphyses , and comprise one or more condyles in the case of concave articulations ( Francillon-Vieillot et al . , 1990 ) . Long bones elongate from the growth plate , which is located in the metaphysis ( Figure 1 ) . In this region , the cartilage is progressively substituted with bone: this process is called endochondral ossification ( Francillon-Vieillot et al . , 1990; Hall , 2005 ) . In extant amniotes , long-bone elongation results from the proliferation of longitudinal columns of hypertrophic cartilage cells , called hypertrophic chondrocytes ( Francillon-Vieillot et al . , 1990; Haines , 1942; Xie et al . , 2020; Figure 1A ) . The latter express collagen type X which facilitates the calcification of the surrounding matrix ( Gudmann and Karsdal , 2016; Lüllmann-Rauch , 2015 ) . To do so , the hypertrophic chondrocytes secrete matrix vesicles containing calcium phosphate crystals ( Amizuka , 2012; Anderson and Shapiro , 2010 ) . The vesicles align longitudinally along the septa . The crystals penetrate the vesicle membranes to form stellate clusters of needle-shaped apatite in the extra cellular matrix ( Amizuka , 2012 ) . The mineralisation thus propagates following the longitudinal organisation of the septa ( Amizuka , 2012; Anderson and Shapiro , 2010; Figure 1A ) . Blood vessels and marrow processes invade the growth plate along these columns of hypertrophic cartilage ( Lüllmann-Rauch , 2015; Figure 1A ) . Lytic enzymes secreted by the bone-marrow cells degrade the cartilage matrix , which is progressively substituted by bone deposition ( Lüllmann-Rauch , 2015; Suzuki et al . , 1981 ) . Growth factors , such as the vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , trigger cartilage calcification and regulate endochondral ossification through stimulation of blood-vessel ingrowth into the diaphysis ( Gerber et al . , 1999 ) . The lines of calcifying stellate clusters of crystals therefore form a scaffold for future trabecular bone deposition ( Amizuka , 2012 ) . This results in the formation of a bony mesh of longitudinal trabeculae ( Figure 1A ) , which is progressively incorporated into the metaphysis where haematopoietic stem cell ( HSC ) niches ( Figure 1A ) are located ( Calvi et al . , 2003; Zhang et al . , 2003 ) in the close vicinity of trabecular/endothelial surfaces ( Gong , 1978; Nilsson et al . , 2001; Wilson and Trumpp , 2006 ) . HSC form localised niches whose environment is greatly controlled and regulated ( Orkin and Zon , 2008; Sipkins et al . , 2005; Zhang et al . , 2003 ) . Often in mature animals the growth plate disappears , causing the senescence of long-bone elongation ( Kilborn et al . , 2002 ) . In most amniotes , the trabecular mesh in the metaphysis can be vastly remodelled ( Haines , 1975 ) . HSC can thereafter be observed adjacent to epiphyseal trabeculae ( Askenasy and Farkas , 2002 ) . In extant urodeles ( e . g . Pleurodeles waltl , De Ricqlès , 1964; De Ricqlès , 1965 ) , the elongation of limb bones differs from the process in amniotes ( Francillon-Vieillot et al . , 1990; Haines , 1938; Figure 1B ) . Unlike mammals , endochondral ossification starts at a later stage in urodeles ( De Ricqlès , 1964 ) . The diaphyseal cartilaginous matrix is first hollowed by the formation of lacunae that are subsequently filled in with bone marrow , far before endochondral ossification starts ( De Ricqlès , 1964 ) . In mammals and birds ( e . g . mouse , Zelzer et al . , 2002; chicken , Carlevaro et al . , 2000 ) , VEGF initiates vascular ingrowth before endochondral ossification starts . In the amphibian Bufo gargarizan , a peak of VEGF expression is present in the hindlimb at metamorphic climax ( Gao et al . , 2018 ) paralleling an increase of endochondral ossification activity ( Bo et al . , 2018 ) . VEGF would therefore seem to play a major role in amphibian long-bone endochondral ossification as well , but this role still needs to be characterised . The growth plate in the metaphysis of urodeles exhibits no aligned columns of hypertrophic cartilage cells or drastically reduced alignment of a few cells at most ( De Ricqlès , 1965; Dickson , 1982; Felisbino and Carvalho , 1999; Felisbino and Carvalho , 2001; Figure 1B ) . Contrary to amniotes , when present , these aligned columns of hypertrophic cartilage do not constitute the location where the ossification takes place ( Figure 1B ) . Instead , the mineralisation front is located in the underlying areas of the growth plate ( i . e . in a layer of non-oriented hypertrophic cartilage or stratified non-oriented hypertrophic cartilage , De Ricqlès , 1965 ) . There , after erosion of the cartilage , mineralisation occurs in urodeles via the formation of globular structures called globuli ossei ( Figure 1B; De Ricqlès , 1965; Quilhac et al . , 2014 ) and spherical mineralisation around them ( forming Liesegang’s rings , Francillon-Vieillot et al . , 1990 ) . Globuli ossei are either ( 1 ) opened hypertrophic cartilaginous cells which died and were subsequently invaded by a cell from the blood/marrow system to initiate mineralisation or ( 2 ) uneroded hypertrophic cartilaginous cells modified into active cells which synthesise bone-like collagen fibrils ( of intermediate size between type II of the cartilage and type I of the bone , Quilhac et al . , 2014 ) . The endochondral ossification therefore does not produce a longitudinally-oriented trabecular network ( Figure 1B ) , but forms instead a light reticular mesh ( De Ricqlès , 1965; Quilhac et al . , 2014; Sanchez et al . , 2008 ) , rich in globuli ossei ( De Ricqlès , 1964; Haines , 1938; Quilhac et al . , 2014; Sanchez et al . , 2010a ) . The epiphyses of urodeles remain cartilaginous while they often ossify in anurans ( Castanet et al . , 2003; Francillon , 1981; Sanchez et al . , 2008 ) . This is probably an adaptation to a demanding jumping locomotion and/or heterochronic mechanisms relevant to this clade ( Francillon , 1981 ) . In the medullary cavity of their long bones however , the cartilaginous cells hypertrophy with no preferential orientation as in urodeles ( Dickson , 1982; Felisbino and Carvalho , 1999; Felisbino and Carvalho , 2001; Miura et al . , 2008; Rozenblut and Ogielska , 2005 ) . The resulting spongiosa is largely reduced ( even quite often absent , Francillon , 1981 ) . The epiphyseal cartilage hangs over the ossification notch and the shaft ( Francillon , 1981 ) to ossify straight after the metamorphosis ( Miura et al . , 2008; Rozenblut and Ogielska , 2005 ) . The function of bone marrow in amphibian long bones also differs from the function in extant amniotes . Indeed , in amphibians , the sites for haematopoiesis almost exclusively comprise the thymus , spleen and liver ( Akiyoshi and Inoue , 2012; Hightower and Pierre , 1971 ) . Bone marrow only plays a role of haematopoiesis in a few amphibian species ( e . g . Xenopus laevis , Rana catesbeiana , Tanaka , 1976; Phillobates terribilis , Dendrobates tinctorius , Kapp et al . , 2018 ) . In these cases , haematopoiesis occurs in endosteal regions of the diaphysis between sinusoids ( i . e . fenestrated capillaries; Figure 1B2 ) and endosteum ( Tanaka , 1976 ) . No HSC has been observed so far in the epiphysis of frogs . Is the urodele model the plesiomorphic or the derived condition for tetrapod long-bone elongation and bone-marrow function ? Very little attention has been given to these aspects of limb-bone evolution . On the one hand , some authors suggest that the amniote-like elongation process may have been the primitive state ( Haines , 1942 ) but no fossil evidence was provided . On the other hand , early tetrapods had cartilaginous epiphyses like extant urodeles . Could that be an indication for a urodele-like primitive condition ( e . g . Sanchez et al . , 2008; Sanchez et al . , 2010a ) ? This debate relied on the absence of evidence from stem-tetrapod data . Recently , palaeohistological studies revealed a fan-like longitudinal trabecular arrangement in the long-bone metaphysis of the 380-million-year-old lobe-finned fish Eusthenopteron ( Sanchez et al . , 2014 ) , and in the 365-million-year-old limbed stem-tetrapod Acanthostega ( Sanchez et al . , 2016 ) . These patterns would result from the same elongation process as in amniotes and would rather suggest that amphibians exhibit a derived condition . Using three-dimensional ( 3D ) virtual histology based on propagation phase-contrast X-ray synchrotron radiation micro-computed tomography ( PPC-SRµCT ) , as well as classical thin-section histology , we herein investigate several stem amphibians and stem amniotes to provide the first glimpses for characterising the early evolution of long-bone elongation and bone-marrow roles . 2 Results As the humerus was crushed ( Figure 2A ) , only a small region of the metaphysis could be sectioned and visualised ( Figure 2B ) . Nevertheless , a relatively complete sequence of calcification ( extending over 600 µm ) can be described here . The upper part of the section reflects the irregular surface of the calcification front ( separating the unpreserved eroded non-calcified cartilage from the preserved calcified cartilage ) ( Figure 2B ) . Under this region , obvious figures of globuli ossei are entrapped in Liesegang’s rings ( g . o . and l . r . , Figure 2Bb1-2 ) . They are numerous and unevenly arranged . Their sizes ( ranging from 9 to 15 µm in diameter ) seem as well unevenly distributed . The trabeculae are very few in this thin section ( t . , Figure 2Bb2 ) . Both bones exhibit large sequences of cartilage calcification which spread over more than a third of the total bone length on each side of the long bone ( Figure 2C ) . The mineralisation front ( m . f . , Figure 2C ) is located relatively far under the ossification notch ( 400 µm ) ( o . n . , Figure 2C ) . Numerous globuli ossei can be visualised in the metaphysis ( g . o . , Figure 2Cc1 , 3 ) . They are unevenly distributed and their size ranges between 8 and 25 µm . Clusters of chondrocytes can be observed ( c . c . , Figure 2Cc3 ) . The top of the epiphysis probably exhibited a uniform matrix of uncalcified cartilage before the fossilisation that was not preserved afterwards . The mesh of ossified trabeculae is very scattered and shows no preferential orientation ( t . , Figure 2Cc1 ) . The epiphysis and metaphysis of the radius and ulna of this individual ( Figure 3A ) are more hollowed than those of the specimen GPIM-N 1297 , with less cartilaginous matrix between the mineralised trabeculae ( Figure 3B ) . Fewer globuli ossei are visible ( g . o . , Figure 3Bb1 ) . Instead , large empty lacunae can be observed ( 75 µm ) ( e . l . , Figure 3Bb1 ) . Large bays of erosion open as well between these lacunae ( e . b . , Figure 3Bb2 ) . The process of mineralisation therefore seems more advanced but no obvious trabecular organisation can be observed . In the humerus of SMNS 54981 ( Figure 4A ) , the process of mineralisation seems relatively advanced as the globuli ossei only remain along a few mineralised trabeculae ( g . o . , Figure 4B ) . They are 16 µm large . In the metaphysis , the cartilage has been removed by erosional process ( e . b . , Figure 4B ) . The uncalcified cartilage in the epiphysis has not been preserved during the fossilisation ( at least in this slide ) . The quantity of calcified cartilage is higher in the zeugopod ( i . e . radius and ulna ) than in the stylopod ( i . e . humerus ) ( Figure 4Cc1-2 ) . Most of the uncalcified cartilage has been eroded . The calcified cartilage is hollowed , thereby forming multiple bays of erosion ( e . b . , Figure 4Cc2 ) . Nevertheless , the globuli ossei remain connected to each other by calcified-cartilage trabeculae ( c . c . t . , Figure 4Cc2 ) or mineralised trabeculae ( m . t . , Figure 4C ) present in the metaphysis . This thin section in the humerus of SMNS 54988 ( Figure 5A ) shows a very remodelled bone with large bays of erosion in the cartilaginous matrix ( e . b . , Figure 5Bb ) and only a few remaining globuli ossei at the surface of the bone trabeculae ( g . o . , Figure 5Bb ) . Most of the cartilaginous matrix has been eroded . There is no preserved cartilage in the epiphysis . The bony trabeculae have no preferential orientation . As for the zeugopod of the specimen SMNS 54988 ( Figure 5Aa ) , the globuli ossei seem to be replaced by large empty lacunae ( 30 µm , e . l . , Figure 5C ) . A certain amount of uncalcified cartilage has been eroded in the distal epiphyses and metaphyses . Nevertheless , a large amount of cartilage is still present in the proximal metaphyses of both long bones ( c . m . , Figure 5C ) . No or very few trabeculae can be observed . Transverse thin sections were made in the metaphysis of the femur ( Konietzko-Meier and Sander , 2013 ) of Metoposaurus diagnosticus krasiejowensis ( Sulej , 2002 ) recently re-diagnosed as Metoposaurus krasiejowensis ( Brusatte et al . , 2015 ) . They revealed a dense trabecular mesh . The longitudinal virtual thin sections , made with PPC-SRµCT and presented here , were made in the proximal and distal metaphyses of a humerus of Metoposaurus sp . and confirm the presence of a dense trabecular mesh in the overall humerus ( Figure 6Aa1-2 ) . Additionally , a directional coloured light effect ( cf . Materials and method section , Sanchez et al . , 2014 ) shows that this mesh is oriented longitudinally and exhibits a fan-like shape in the metaphyses ( purple trabeculae , Figure 6Aa2 ) . The trabecular mesh covers the entire volume of the metaphysis and spreads into the diaphysis ( Figure 6Aa1-2 ) . The mineralisation front ( m . f . , Figure 6Aa1 ) contacts the sediment in which the bone is embedded ( Figure 6Ba ) . The surface of the mineralisation front is irregular . No ossified epiphysis was found , thereby suggesting that a cartilaginous cap was probably covering the bone . This cap did not preserve over the fossilisation . In the metaphysis , the trabeculae are homogeneously distributed ( t . , Figure 6Bb ) . Some remnants of calcified cartilage are visible through Liesegang’s rings forming within the cartilage remaining between the metaphyseal trabeculae ( Figure 6Bc ) . The mean thickness of the trabeculae is 117 µm ( Table 2 ) . Tubular structures can be observed ( m . p . , Figure 6Ba ) . They end blindly at the location of the mineralisation front . They are well defined tubes ( 248 µm in diameter , Table 2 ) , although anastomosed . They ossified through endochondral ossification . These tubes are locally slightly eroded ( Figures 6Ba and 10A ) . The size of these tubes , their intimate connection to each other and their location strongly support their identification as marrow processes ( Haines , 1938 ) . This specimen was investigated using PPC-SRµCT . The spongiosa occupies the entire bone area ( Figure 7A ) . The metaphyseal trabeculae are about four times thinner ( 25 µm on average ) than the diaphyseal trabeculae ( 94 µm on average , Table 2 and Estefa et al . , 2020 ) . A longitudinal section reveals that the trabecular mesh becomes denser towards the distal and proximal ends of the bone ( Figure 7Aa1-2 ) . As the shape of the bone widens and flattens from midshaft towards the metaphyseal surfaces , the longitudinal trabeculae tilt , thereby forming a fan-like configuration ( Figure 7Aa2 ) . In the metaphysis , the trabecular mesh is mostly arranged longitudinally ( obviously appearing purple and progressively shifting to green as the deltopectoral crest tilts to 90 degrees , Figure 7Aa2 ) although a few anastomoses ( highlighted in green in most of the metaphysis apart from the tilted region of the deltopectoral crest , Figure 7Aa2 ) run radially . A few remnants of calcified cartilage ( Francillon-Vieillot et al . , 1990 ) are very rarely visible ( Estefa et al . , 2020 ) . Marrow processes form an intricate network , while anastomosing to each other , and connecting to cavities of irregular shapes and sizes ( Figure 7Ba , c and 10B ) . These tubular structures are around 100 µm in diameter under the mineralisation front ( Table 2 ) . They contact each other when they reach the mineralisation front ( Figure 10B ) . No ossified epiphysis was found . The humeral epiphysis was probably not preserved due to being unmineralised cartilage . A longitudinal virtual thin section from the PPC-SRµCT data shows that the trabecular network remains relatively dense in the metaphyses ( Figure 8A ) at the adult stage . The trabecular mesh is longitudinally and radially oriented like a fan although slightly less organised than in the juvenile specimen ( purple trabeculae , Figure 8Aa2 ) . The trabeculae appear to be more remodelled , leaving large cavities resulting from an intense erosional process ( Figure 8Aa2 ) . The cortex is almost inexistent in the metaphysis ( Figure 8Bb ) . The thickness of the trabeculae averages 30 µm ( Table 2 , Estefa et al . , 2020 ) , which is equivalent to the thickness of the trabeculae in the juvenile metaphysis ( MNG 7747 ) . There is no endosteal bone on the surface of the medullary cavity . Very few remnants of calcified cartilage were found in the metaphysis of the adult humerus , that is in much lower frequency than in the juvenile specimen ( Estefa et al . , 2020 ) . The spongiosa contains a few longitudinal interconnected marrow processes ( 100 µm in diameter , Figure 8Bb-c and 10C , Table 2 ) . When present , these processes exhibit the same distribution as in the juvenile humerus . The epiphyses were not ossified . A resting surface ( yellow arrow , Figure 8Aa2 ) , red arrows , ( Figure 8—figure supplement 1A ) , can be observed 2-to-4 mm under the mineralisation front . It is observed as well in the distal metaphysis ( Figure 8—figure supplement 1A ) . This resembles Harris lines identified in mammals ( Garn et al . , 1968; Harris , 1933 ) and birds ( Wegner , 1874 ) . Although these lines are very common in mammals ( including extant and extinct taxa , Duckler and Van Valkenburgh , 1998 ) , they have not been comprehensively studied in other groups . We find that they can also be encountered in groups with no secondary ossification centre such as chelonians ( e . g . Centrochelys sulcata , Figure 8—figure supplement 1B ) and crocodilians ( e . g . Crocodylus niloticus , P . T . pers . obs . ) . Harris lines seem to result from both short- and long-term pressures ( e . g . starvation – Park , 1964; disease and deficiencies – Duckler and Van Valkenburgh , 1998 ) . Thin sections were made and described in the distal metaphysis of the femur of the specimen KO224 of D . austriacus ( Sanchez et al . , 2008 ) . They revealed a dense trabecular mesh and the absence of calcified cartilage . Virtual thin sections from three-dimensional PPC-SRµCT scans in the humerus SNM Z 15568 complete these observations despite the fact that the metaphyseal spongiosa is partly crushed ( Figure 9Aa2 ) . As the femur KO224 ( Sanchez et al . , 2008 ) , the humerus SNM Z 15568 exhibits a dense trabecular mesh in both the proximal and distal metaphyses with a fan-like trabecular orientation ( purple trabeculae , Figure 9Aa2 ) . The trabeculae are homogeneously distributed in the metaphysis . They are 54 µm thick on average ( Table 2 ) . They are eroded at the base of the metaphysis ( Figure 9Aa1-2 ) . Some tubular marrow processes ( average diameter: 111 µm , Table 2 ) open up directly towards the diaphysis into the metaphyseal space of the medullary cavity left vacant after erosion ( Figures 9B and 10D ) . The surface of the mineralisation front is irregular ( Figure 9Ba ) . The latter probably was covered by uncalcified cartilage . 3 Discussion Although all limb bones studied here have cartilaginous epiphyses , their metaphyseal organisation , and the underlying long-bone elongation processes , can greatly differ between taxa . The long-bone elongation in Apateon probably results from the hypertrophying action of scattered cartilaginous cells in the upper part of the metaphysis ( Figure 11 ) . The fossils revealed a mineralisation front characterised by a large number of globuli ossei ( Figures 2–5 ) , which progressively replaced these hypertrophic chondrocytes , as in urodeles ( De Ricqlès , 1964; De Ricqlès , 1965; Haines , 1938; Quilhac et al . , 2014 ) . As the uncalcified cartilage is not preserved in Apateon , it is not possible to check whether the growth zone and calcifying zone are distant as in amphibians ( De Ricqlès , 1965; Felisbino and Carvalho , 1999; Felisbino and Carvalho , 2001 ) . However , the presence of very few bony trabeculae , with no preferential orientation in the metaphyseal region of Apateon’s long bones ( Figures 2–5 ) strongly support the idea that the ossification did not occur within a zone of columnar hypertrophic cartilage . Bone elongation was probably followed by mineralisation through globuli ossei as previously observed in the temnospondyl dissorophoid Doleserpeton ( De Ricqlès , 1963; Figure 11 ) . On the contrary , the metaphyseal trabecular meshes in the limb bones of Metoposaurus , Seymouria and Discosauriscus all exhibit the same fan-like pattern of longitudinal trabeculae . This implies that the growth plate comprised longitudinal columns of hypertrophic cells where endochondral ossification occurred through columnar cartilage-to-bone substitution ( Francillon-Vieillot et al . , 1990; Kronenberg , 2003 ) as seen in turtles and crocodiles ( e . g . Haines , 1938; Haines , 1942 ) , lepidosaurs ( e . g . Haines , 1969 ) , dinosaurs ( De Ricqlès , 1968; Horner et al . , 2000; Horner et al . , 2001 ) , birds ( e . g . Horner et al . , 2001 ) and mammals ( e . g . Jacenko et al . , 1993; Figure 11 ) . Although this fan-like trabecular configuration can be greatly remodelled in extant amniotes , it is only slightly remodelled here in the adult Seymouria and subadult Discosauriscus ( Figures 8 and 9 ) . Therefore , our study shows that the amniote-like long-bone elongation is more commonly distributed than previously thought . It is not restrained to the appendicular skeleton of amniotes – including Discosauriscus and Seymouria ( as demonstrated here ) , Ophiacodon , Dicynodon and some kannemeyeriids ( De Ricqlès , 1972; Haines , 1938 ) , marine reptiles , Plesiosaurus and Nothosaurus ( Haines , 1938 ) – neither to that of stem tetrapods ( Kamska et al . , 2018; Sanchez et al . , 2014; Sanchez et al . , 2016; Figure 11 ) . Indeed , our study demonstrates for the first time that certain temnospondyls like Metoposaurus also elongated their appendicular skeleton like amniotes ( Figure 11 ) . We can confidently conclude that ( 1 ) endochondral ossification based on the mineralisation of longitudinal columns of hypertrophic cartilage is a primitive process for the elongation of the appendicular skeleton in tetrapods and that ( 2 ) ossification through globuli ossei is restricted to a limited group of stem- and crown-batrachians ( Figure 11 ) . The mineralisation processes in extant amphibians and amniotes largely differ in many points: ( 1 ) their timing and microstructural relationships ( i . e . ossification dependant on a calcified scaffold in amniotes , Amizuka , 2012 , but not in amphibians , Felisbino and Carvalho , 2001 ) , ( 2 ) their initiation ( i . e . stacks of hypertrophic cells in amniotes , Lüllmann-Rauch , 2015 , versus isolated hypertrophic cells in amphibians , De Ricqlès , 1965; Quilhac et al . , 2014 ) and ( 3 ) their molecular mechanisms ( i . e . collagen type X secreted in amniotes , Gudmann and Karsdal , 2016; versus fibrillar collagens in amphibians , Quilhac et al . , 2014 ) . How could such distinct mineralisation processes play the same functional role in long-bone elongation in different vertebrates ? In addition to a columnar pattern of trabeculae , several remnants of Liesegang’s rings could be observed in the fossil limb bones of Metoposaurus ( Figure 6Bc and Konietzko-Meier and Sander , 2013 ) and , to a lesser extent , Seymouria ( Estefa et al . , 2020 ) and stem-tetrapods ( i . e . Hyneria , Eusthenopteron and Acanthostega , Kamska et al . , 2018; Sanchez et al . , 2014; Sanchez et al . , 2016 ) . The most parsimonious evolutionary scenario therefore suggests that stem tetrapods were able to produce globular calcified cartilage although they were elongating their bone through a columnar configuration ( Figure 11 ) . Long-bone elongation exclusively based on the intensive production of globuli ossei would have been a derived feature emerging within temnospondyls and restricted to extant batrachians and their close dissorophoid temnospondyl relatives ( e . g . Apateon and Doleserpeton ) . Within amniotes – including stem amniotes – the globular calcification of the cartilage would have drastically reduced to be fully abandoned to the benefit of an exclusive columnar elongation ( Figure 11 ) . Two exceptions persist in amniotes: ( 1 ) large aquatic animals usually produce a large amount of globular calcified cartilage to balance their buoyancy or in extremely retarded developmental conditions , such as paedomorphosis ( e . g . pachy-osteosclerotic amniotes , De Buffrénil et al . , 2008; De Ricqlès and De Buffrénil , 2001; crocodiles , Haines , 1938 ) , ( 2 ) diseased amniotes can have osteosclerotic problems which result in the production and retention of globuli ossei ( Gussen , 1967 ) . In such cases , the production of globuli ossei is not solely located in the epiphysis and does not play any role in the elongation process of limb bones . Even though these cases reflect derived and/or rare conditions , they show that amniotes keep the ability to produce globuli ossei although they do not allocate them to the limb-bone elongation process . It was hypothesised that a large number of globuli ossei would be associated with a slow limb-bone endochondral ossification and development ( De Ricqlès , 1972; Haines , 1938 ) . This was based on the observation of globular calcification in small extant amphibians and neotenic aquatic forms , as well as the rarity or even absence of globuli ossei in fast growing juvenile mammals and birds ( De Ricqlès , 1972; De Ricqlès , 1979; Haines , 1942; Quilhac et al . , 2014 ) . The observations contained herein clearly show that long-bone developmental dynamics does not seem to be the leading or unique factor for performing one or the other of the elongation and calcification processes . Indeed , the stem tetrapods Hyneria , Eusthenopteron and Acanthostega ( with a humerus remaining cartilaginous for several years ) , all exhibit the characteristics of a slow appendicular development ( and slow somatic development as a whole for Eusthenopteron and Acanthostega [Sanchez et al . , 2014; Sanchez et al . , 2016] ) but only produce very few globuli ossei ( Kamska et al . , 2018; Sanchez et al . , 2014; Sanchez et al . , 2016 ) . On the contrary , they all present an obvious longitudinal metaphyseal spongiosa strongly supporting the development of a hypertrophic columnar cartilaginous growth plate . The somatic size and ecology were also hypothesised to play a role in limb-bone elongation strategy ( De Ricqlès , 1972 ) . Once again , our data challenge this hypothesis . Both seymouriamorphs , Seymouria and Discosauriscus , and the temnospondyl Metoposaurus exhibit the same trabecular pattern despite different somatic sizes ( skull length of an adult Seymouria estimated to 9 . 5 cm , Berman et al . , 2000; skull length of a possibly adult Discosauriscus estimated to 6 . 2 cm , Klembara , 1995; Klembara , 2009; skull length of an adult Metoposaurus estimated to 40–50 cm , Sulej , 2007 ) and distinct ecologies ( Seymouria and Discosauriscus being ( supposedly ) terrestrial , Berman and Martens , 1993; Klembara , 2009; Klembara and Meszároš , 1992; and Metoposaurus being aquatic , Schoch and Milner , 2000 ) . Felisbino and Carvalho , 2001 investigated the limb-bone ossification of the amphibian Rana . They observed a late calcification and late ossification of the trabeculae in Rana catesbeiana which did not contribute to the bone elongation ( Felisbino and Carvalho , 2001 ) . The authors therefore suggested that the production of globuli ossei could probably play a greater role in reinforcing the limb-bone microstructure – for jumping after a certain age – rather than being associated with its elongation . Because urodeles do not jump despite their late ossification onset , the reasons for them to produce many globuli ossei could not be justified as such . The use of exclusive globular calcification and globuli ossei for long-bone endochondral ossification and elongation would therefore probably result from the combination of multiple factors shared by both batrachians and dissorophoids . In order to precisely identify these factors , an extended histological study will have to be carried out within temnospondyls ( considering as many environmental factors as possible , including their ecologies and sizes ) to draw strong and broad conclusions on this evolutionary pattern and the reasons for it to be that restricted in the evolutionary history of tetrapods . Nevertheless , the current study shows that amphibians , often considered as models for exhibiting primitive tetrapod features , should be regarded as a clade with a significantly derived evolutionary history , at least with respect to their skeleton . As the long bones of Apateon were thin sectioned , it was not possible to assess the 3D organisation of the trabecular mesh nor the calcified cartilage mass to check out the potential presence of marrow processes . The microanatomy of the other taxa ( Metoposaurus , Seymouria , Discosauriscus ) , however , could be investigated in 3D using PPC-SRµCT . It revealed tubular structures which can be confidently interpreted as marrow processes ( on the basis of their shape , size and location in the bone ) , as seen in extant crocodiles ( Haines , 1938 ) . The marrow processes in these groups differ from the closed system observed in the stem tetrapod Eusthenopteron ( Sanchez et al . , 2014 ) . Instead the marrow processes in Metoposaurus open up into multilocular spaces in the trabecular mesh of the metaphysis . In Discosauriscus and Seymouria , the marrow processes lead to a series of small interconnected cavities ( m . c . , Figure 10 ) which connect to other tubular processes and open up into the medullary cavity of the bone shaft . The size and shape of these interconnected cavities are variable . These small cavities would therefore rather correspond to a primary regionalisation of the marrow environment – as seen in amniotes like Crocodylus ( Haines , 1938 ) . As a result of intense erosion , the tubular marrow processes in Discosauriscus more often directly plug into the medullary cavity of the shaft . On the contrary , the shaft of Metoposaurus is highly crossed by thick trabeculae ( Table 2 ) forming multilocular spaces as in Andrias ( Sanchez et al . , 2014; Figure 10—figure supplement 1 ) . The tip of the marrow process forming a tube penetrating the hypertrophic cartilage of the growth plate in crocodiles is located at the level of the mineralisation front , and in mammals , that is at the base of the calcifying layer of hypertrophic cartilaginous cells ( Figure 1A ) . The tip of the marrow process plays a role in initiating endochondral ossification with marrow cells releasing lytic enzymes that degrade the calcified cartilaginous matrix ( Suzuki et al . , 1981 ) . In amniotes , the marrow process directly connects with the medullary cavity of the shaft ( Haines , 1942 ) where blood vessels supply growth factors to initiate the ossification ( Gerber et al . , 1999 ) . The bone marrow also produces haematopoietic cells and stem cells ( HSC ) which need to remain in regulated microenvironments called niches ( Zhang et al . , 2003 ) . The latter are located in the metaphysis , in obligatory proximity with both endothelial and endosteal surfaces ( Wilson and Trumpp , 2006 ) . For that reason , haematopoiesis only occurs in long bones whose shafts are greatly opened ( Bazzini et al . , 1986; Tanaka , 1976 ) . In mammals , the medullary cavity of the shaft can be infilled by calcified cartilage or numerous trabeculae ( e . g . pachyostotic condition , De Ricqlès and De Buffrénil , 2001 ) . A study was conducted on amedullar , pachyostotic long bones of manatees ( Trichechus manatus , Bazzini et al . , 1986 ) . Because haematopoiesis cannot be hosted in their long-bone medullary shaft , manatees have evolved an alternative primary site of haematopoiesis in their vertebral bodies ( Bazzini et al . , 1986 ) . In amphibians , bays of erosion progressively form within the cartilage of the medullary cavity during the development . They can either be isolated forming multilocular spaces separated by bony septa ( sept . , Figure 1B1 ) or forming an open medullary cavity ( Figure 1B2 ) . Marrow processes in the humerus of the aquatic giant salamander Andrias ( Figure 10—figure supplement 1 ) show interconnected tubular structures which open up onto spaces separated by septa in the shaft ( Figure 10—figure supplement 1 ) . Long bones are probably deprived of haematopoietic activity in this taxon as initial sites of haematopoieisis are located in the liver ( Akiyoshi and Inoue , 2012 ) . No haematopoietic activity could be observed either in the long bones of the urodele Triturus ( Cynops ) pyrrhogaster exhibiting a multilocular configuration ( Tanaka , 1976; Figure 1B1 ) . However , amphibians with open long-bone medullary cavities ( Figure 1B2 ) produce blood cells ( e . g . Rana catesbeiana , Tanaka , 1976 ) and exhibit no haematopoietic liver structure ( e . g . Akiyoshi and Inoue , 2012 ) . In the case of an open medullary cavity , marrow vessels run from a central vein into accessory sinusoids ( s . , Figure 1B2 ) to form an adequate environment for haematopoietic activity ( Tanaka , 1976 ) . The centralisation of the vascular and marrow systems is therefore crucial for haematopoiesis to occur in long bones ( Tanaka , 1976 ) . Based on these observations , the full compartmentalisation of the marrow processes in Eusthenopteron ( Sanchez et al . , 2014 ) , as well as the multilocular arrangement in Metoposaurus ( Figure 6 ) , would probably prevent the formation of a centralised vascular network ( as observed in Andrias; Figure 10—figure supplement 1 or Triturus ( Cynops ) pyrrhogaster , Tanaka , 1976; Figure 1B1 ) . This would eventually deprive the marrow cells from HSC niches . We therefore propose that the marrow processes in Eusthenopteron and Metoposaurus may have only been involved in the induction of endochondral ossification for the elongation of the fin/limb bone but not in haematopoiesis . The humerus of the Devonian limbed stem tetrapod , Acanthostega , also exhibits tubular structures under the mineralisation front of the growth plate ( Sanchez et al . , 2016 ) . They can be identified as marrow processes . They open up onto multilocular spaces separated by numerous septa as in Metoposaurus and Andrias ( Figure 10—figure supplement 1 ) . For that reason , it is likely that the vascularisation in the medullary bone of Acanthostega was not centralised and no marrow haematopoiesis could be produced in their long bones . The interconnected small cavities opening up into a large medullary cavity as seen in the terrestrial Permian seymouriamorphs Seymouria and Discosauriscus ( Figure 10B–D ) would therefore presumably constitute one of the first forms of microenvironment for HSC niches . The multiple functions of bone marrow would have been acquired at different times in the history of tetrapod evolution . Bone-marrow initiation of endochondral ossification already existed in finned stem tetrapods while trabecular opening/erosion for haematopoiesis could only be evidenced in the ( 300-million-year-old ) Permian seymouriamorphs so far . The migration of blood-cell production in long bones would therefore not seem to be an exaptation predating the water-to-land transition . We intend to investigate the long-bone microanatomy of early tetrapods to identify the timing of this major evolutionary step and elucidate the question whether haematopoiesis migrated into bone marrow in the first tetrapods who ventured on land ( with body fossil evidence from 360 million years ago ) or afterwards when the process of terrestrialisation was a bit more advanced during the Carboniferous ( 350–300 million years ago ) . This will help clarify the convergent factors – environmental conditions ( with temperature changes – Weiss and Wislocki , 1956; UV dose – Kapp et al . , 2018 ) and/or biological factors ( e . g . active locomotion – Tanaka , 1976 ) – accompanying the migration of bone-marrow haematopoietic activity into long bones in both amphibians and amniotes . 4 Materials and methods We focus on studying the limb-bone growth plate and marrow processes of the temnospondyls A . pedestris , A . caducus , and Metoposaurus sp . , considered as stem amphibians ( or at least stem batrachians – including anurans and urodeles ) by most authors ( e . g . Anderson , 2008; Milner , 1988; Pardo et al . , 2017; Ruta and Coates , 2007; Schoch , 2019; Schoch and Milner , 2004; Sigurdsen and Green , 2011; Trueb and Cloutier , 1991 ) – although we are aware that some authors have proposed diverging hypotheses ( e . g . Marjanović and Laurin , 2013; Vallin and Laurin , 2004 ) . We also investigate the bone histology of the seymouriamorphs S . sanjuanensis and D . austriacus , which we consider stem amniotes following general consensus ( e . g . Anderson , 2007; Klembara et al . , 2014; Ruta and Coates , 2007 ) . The specimens of A . caducus ( GPIM-N 1297 and GPIM-N 1572 ) were discovered in the Carboniferous-Permian locality of Erdesbach , Saar Nahe Basin , Germany . GPIM-N 1297 is a juvenile individual ( Figure 2A ) and GPIM-N 1572 is an adult ( Figure 3A ) . Their radius and ulna , in addition to the humerus of GPIM-N 1297 exclusively , were longitudinally sectioned through their epiphyses ( Sanchez et al . , 2010a ) . The specimens of A . pedestris ( SMNS 54981 – Figure 4A – and SMNS 54988 – Figure 5A ) come from the Carboniferous-Permian locality of Odernheim , Saar Nahe Basin , Germany ( Boy , 2003; Sanchez et al . , 2010a; Sanchez et al . , 2010b ) . They are both adult specimens ( Sanchez et al . , 2010a ) . Longitudinal thin sections were taken from their humerus , radius and ulna ( Sanchez et al . , 2010a ) . All specimens of Apateon were found unambiguously as articulated fossil skeletons . The specimens of Apateon referred to as SMNS and GPIM-N belong to the collections of the Staatliches Museum für Naturkunde ( Stuttgart , Germany ) and the specimens marked with MB . Am to the Museum für Naturkunde ( Berlin , Germany ) . The humerus of Metoposaurus sp . comes from the Late Triassic locality of Skarszyny in southern Poland . This was found as an isolated bone in association with small bone fragments and calcified plant remains . The specimen could be assigned to the genus of Metoposaurus ( Temnospondyli ) on the basis of the following morphological characters: ( 1 ) a short and slender shaft , ( 2 ) a wide head , ( 3 ) a pronounced ectepicondyle , ( 4 ) the base of the radial condyle forms a small prominence on its ventral side and ( 5 ) the radial crest continues from the ectepicondyle to the proximal head ( Sulej , 2007 ) . The size of the humerus suggests that it is from a ( sub- ) adult individual . The specimen is hosted in the collections of the Geological Museum , Polish Geological Institute – National Research Institute ( Warsaw , Poland ) . The specimen is registered as MUZ PGI OS-220/171 ( Figure 6 ) . The material of S . sanjuanensis studied here consists of two three-dimensionally preserved humeri: one small and one large individual of S . sanjuanensis ( respectively , MNG 7747 – Figure 7 – and CM 28597 – Figure 8 ) . MNG 7747 belongs to a specimen found in the Tambach formation , Bromacker locality , Lower Permian of Central Germany ( Berman et al . , 2000; Berman and Martens , 1993; Klembara et al . , 2001 ) and CM 28597 was excavated in the Cutler Formation , Lower Permian of North-Central New Mexico , USA ( Berman et al . , 1987a; Vaughn , 1966 ) . Both bones were found in articulation to the rest of their limbs ( MNG 7747 – Klembara et al . , 2001; CM 28597 – Berman et al . , 1987b ) . They were therefore identified unambiguously as the humeri of S . sanjuanensis ( MNG 7747 – Berman and Martens , 1993; Klembara et al . , 2001; CM 28597 – Berman et al . , 1987b ) . MNG 7747 is a small left humerus ( Figure 7 , 17 . 21 mm long; Klembara et al . , 2001 ) of a subadult individual ( Klembara et al . , 2001; Klembara et al . , 2006 ) . CM 28597 is more than twice larger ( Figure 8 , 39 . 60 mm long ) and belongs to a right limb . It has been designated as an adult specimen based on its skull length ( Estefa et al . , 2020 ) . The specimen MNG 7747 comes from the collections of the Museum der Natur ( Gotha , Germany ) and CM 28597 from the Carnegie Museum of Natural History ( Pittsburgh , USA ) . The humerus of D . austriacus originates from the Lower Permian of Kochov-Horka in the Czech Republic . The specimen of D . austriacus , SNM Z 15568 , is stored in the collections of the Slovak National Museum in Bratislava ( Bratislava , Slovakia; Figure 9 ) . This bone is the right humerus . It is 18 . 3 mm long and was found in association with the rest of the body . It belongs to a subadult individual ( skull length: 5 . 2 cm; Klembara and Bartík , 1999 ) . None of these last three specimens were physically sectioned , they were studied using PPC-SRµCT , following the protocols developed for virtual bone histology ( Sanchez et al . , 2012; see Methods section ) ."}

But what happens to the brain when it loses a key source of input , for example , following the amputation of a limb ? A region of the brain known as primary somatosensory cortex processes sensory inputs from all over the body . The more sensitive an area of the body is , the more fine-grained its representation is in the cortex . For example , the hand is represented with a highly detailed map , with each finger represented seperately . The brain is thought to require ongoing sensory signals from the body to maintain these detailed representations in the cortex . Indeed , textbooks typically state that the brain will ‘overwrite’ its representation of a body part if input from that area no longer arrives . According to this view , people who have lost a hand should show little or no activity in the area of primary somatosensory cortex that used to represent it . However , many people who have had a limb amputated continue to experience vivid sensations of the missing limb long after its loss . When asked to move their so-called ‘phantom’ limb , these individuals report being able to feel the movement . Kikkert , Kolasinski et al . now show , using advanced imaging techniques , that the brains of individuals with phantom hands continue to represent the missing hand several decades after its loss . Indeed , asking the subjects to move individual fingers of their phantom hand activates fine-grained representations of those fingers , similar to those seen in two-handed controls . By showing that the brain ‘remembers’ an amputated hand , Kikkert , Kolasinski et al . demonstrate that ongoing sensory input is not required to maintain representations of the body in somatosensory cortex . This , in turn , offers new hope for developing prosthetic limbs that are under direct brain control . If the brain continues to represent individual fingers many years after their loss , it should be possible to exploit those pathways to achieve intuitive fine-grained control of artificial fingers .", "article": "1 Introduction The hand area of the primary somatosensory cortex ( S1 ) contains detailed digit maps , with physically adjacent digits represented next to each other . Using high-field neuroimaging , it is now possible to identify these characteristic digit maps in humans , with high inter- and intra-subject reliability ( Ejaz et al . , 2015; Kolasinski et al . , 2016 ) . Digit topography is characterised in neuroimaging by two main principles: digit selectivity ( Kolasinski et al . , 2016 ) and inter-digit overlap ( Ejaz et al . , 2015 ) . These maps are thought to be shaped and maintained by daily life experience: digits used more frequently together in daily life benefit from increased representational overlap ( Ejaz et al . , 2015 ) , and following single digit amputation remaining digits’ topography changes ( Merzenich et al . , 1984 ) . Amputees commonly experience lingering sensations from their amputated body part ( Flor and Nikolajsen , 2006 ) . Phantom sensations are not necessarily painful , and are best described as a vivid sensation of the missing hand as if it is still present ( Flor and Nikolajsen , 2006 ) . When instructed to move their phantom hand , amputees report detailed kinaesthetic sensations regarding the extent of movement afforded by different phantom digits . Phantom movements are known to evoke signals in the sensorimotor system ( Makin et al . , 2013a; Reilly et al . , 2006; Raffin et al . , 2012b ) , previously attributed to abnormal processing caused by the amputation ( e . g . aberrant inputs ( Makin et al . , 2013a ) , peripheral reorganisation ( Reilly et al . , 2006 ) ) . Here we interrogate the information content underlying activity elicited by phantom hand movements . If this information content is unchanged despite amputation , then activity patterns should show characteristic S1 digit topography . To study phantom digit topography , we used ultra high-field 7 tesla neuroimaging in two individuals who lost their left hand several decades ago ( 25 and 31 years post amputation ) and eleven right-handed controls . Both amputees reported exceptionally vivid kinaesthetic phantom sensations during individual digit movements ( see Figure 1—source data 1 , 2 , for clinical and demographic details ) . Amputees and controls were visually cued to execute individual phantom digit movements ( left hand digits in controls ) . Importantly , phantom movements are distinguishable from imagined movements . This is supported by empirical evidence demonstrating that phantom limb movements elicit both central and peripheral motor signals , that are different from those found during imagined movements ( Makin et al . , 2013a; Reilly et al . , 2006; Raffin et al . , 2012b , 2012a ) . To ensure adequate task performance , amputees were asked to demonstrate to the experimenter outside the scanner the extent of volitional movement carried out in each of their phantom digits during the task , by mirroring the phantom movements with their intact hand . To capture the first principle of topography , we employed a technique designed to identify digit preference in S1 ( travelling wave design , see Figure 1—figure supplement 1 for design details; see Figure 1—figure supplement 2 for other brain areas activated by phantom hand movements ) . The resulting gradients of digit preference ( hereafter digit maps ) are presented in Figure 1 . As indicated by the black arrows in the example control participants ( Figure 1A ) , a characteristic digit map shows a gradient of digit preference , progressing from thumb ( red , laterally ) to little finger ( pink , medially ) . Similarly , both amputees showed a clear gradient of digit preference in the central sulcus and postcentral gyrus ( Figure 1B; see Figure 1—figure supplement 3 for intact hand maps ) . Qualitatively , the position , digit order , and extent of the missing hand maps were similar to those observed in controls . Analysis of spatial correspondence of 'same' versus 'different' digit clusters between two halves of the dataset further confirmed that while reduced ( compared to controls ) , digit selectivity in amputees was consistent ( Figure 1D; see Materials and methods for further details ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 15292 . 003Figure 1 . Missing hand maps revealed in amputees during phantom digits movement . Black arrows indicate preference for digits 1–5: thumb ( red ) ; index ( yellow ) ; middle ( green ) ; ring ( blue ) and little finger ( purple ) in two-handed controls ( A , C ) and amputees ( B ) . Participants performed single digit flexion and extension movements with their non-dominant ( controls ) or phantom hand ( amputees ) in a travelling wave paradigm . Qualitatively similar digit topographies were found in each amputee and the controls . White arrows indicate the central sulcus . A = anterior; P = posterior . Multiple comparisons were adjusted using false discovery rate ( FDR ) . ( D ) Maps’ intra-individual split-half consistency , assessed using the Dice overlap coefficient . On average , 'same'-digit selective clusters ( dark bars ) showed greater consistency than 'different'-digit clusters ( light bars ) in amputees and controls . Amputees showed lower split-half consistency for 'same'-digit clusters ( averaged across digits ) compared to controls ( 95% confidence intervals ( CI ) = 0 . 43–0 . 68 , as assessed using a bootstrap approach ) . However , amputees’ 'same'-digit clusters were more consistent than 'different'-digit clusters in controls ( i . e . fell outside the CI of 'different'-digit clusters split-half consistency in controls ) , indicating that although reduced , the digit maps of the amputees were consistent .

To measure phantom sensations , as well as other demographic and clinical details of potential relevance to the studied missing hand representation , amputees completed a range of questionnaires ( e . g . amputation details , prosthesis usage etc . ) . Amputees rated intensities of phantom/stump pain and non-painful phantom sensations ( vividness ) , using a 0 – 100 scale , as follows: ( i ) intensity of worst pain/vivid sensation experienced during the last week ( or in a typical week involving such sensations ) ; ( ii ) intensity of phantom pain on average over the last week ( or in a typical week if last week was atypical ) ; and ( iii ) current intensity/vividness of phantom pain and sensations , during the scanning day . Phantom limb pain magnitude was calculated by dividing worst pain intensity by pain frequency ( 1- all the time; 2- daily; 3- weekly ) . An analogous measure was obtained for vividness of non-painful phantom sensations . This approach represented the chronic aspect of the phantom pain/sensation as it combines frequency and intensity ( Makin et al . , 2013a ) . We also asked the amputees whether they experienced telescoping , a common phenomenon where the perceived length of the phantom limb is changed ( Flor and Nikolajsen , 2006 ) . Amp . = amputation; Amp . level = amputation level measured in percentages: ( residual arm length/intact arm length ) x 100 . Intact arm length is measured from shoulder to fingertips , where 41% is equivalent to the level of the elbow and 75% is equivalent to the level of the wrist; PLS = phantom limb sensations; mag . = magnitude; scan = score of sensation phantom limb vividness/pain intensity on scanning day ( scale 0 – 100 ) ; PLP = phantom limb pain; ave . = score of average phantom limb pain in a typical week ( scale 0 – 100 ) ; prosthetics usage = prosthetic limb usage ( frequency ) : 0- never , 1- rarely , 2- occasionally , 3- daily , 4- more than 4 hours a day , 5- more than 8 hours a day; Y . = yes; N . = no .

Amputees were asked to rate how vivid the phantom movement felt ( PDS = phantom digit sensation; scale 0 – 100; ranging from unable to feel movement to movement is felt as vividly as the sensation of movement elicited by the intact hand digits ) . In addition , amputees were asked to rate how difficult it was to perform each phantom digit movement ( diff . = difficulty; scale 0 – 100; ranging from easy to impossible ) . Finally , participants were asked to rate the quality and extent of movement afforded by each phantom digit . Amputees’ answers were standardised as follows: 1- full range of movements ( i . e . equivalent to movements with the homologous digit on the intact hand ) . 2– near to full range of movement ( i . e . similar to movement of the intact hand , though reduced ) . 3– noticeably less range of movement compared to the intact hand ( i . e . partial finger flexion and extension movement ) .

A travelling wave paradigm , involving digit movements in a set sequence , was used to capture digit preference and the smooth progression of adjacent digit representations in primary somatosensory cortex . ( A ) The travelling wave task involved 8 repeated cycles of continuous individual digit movements . Each 45 s cycle consisted of five 9 s blocks dedicated to each digit ( as exemplified by the coloured squares ) , with each run cycling through either D1-D2-D3-D4-D5 ( forward , top ) or D5-D4-D3-D2-D1 ( backward , bottom ) . Each of the forward and backward runs was repeated twice . The numbers 1–5 and colours correspond to the five digits , as visualised in the right side of the panel . ( B ) Preprocessed BOLD time courses from individual voxels ( the example time course of one voxel is shown in red ) were cross-correlated against a reference model . The model corresponded to a single-digit movement ( 9 s ‘on’ , 36 s ‘off’- the period of movement of all other digits ) , and was systematically shifted in time to model activity throughout a full cycle ( 30 shifts , corresponding to the 30 lags of the 45 s cycle ) . The figure shows three different model lags ( 1 , 12 and 24 ) , resulting in varying cross-correlation outcomes . Lag 24 was the optimal model lag for this preprocessed BOLD time course . ( C ) The standardised r-values ( Fisher’s r-to-z , y-axis ) resulting from the cross-correlation were plotted as a function of lag ( x-axis ) for each individual voxel in each run . In the left panel , cross-correlation values from the example voxel shown in B are plotted for each of the four runs . The optimal fit for the voxel is demonstrated by the peak cross-correlation ( digit 1 , in the left panel; digit 2 in the right panel , taken from separate voxels ) . Lags associated with the same digits were averaged , first within and then across runs . A winner-take-all approach was used to determine digit preference , based on the highest average r-value , resulting in five separate digit maps . False discovery rate ( FDR ) was applied for each of these single digit maps to adjust the threshold based on the criterion q ( FDR ) < 0 . 05 . ( D ) Each of the five digits was assigned a colour code , as demonstrated on the left . The five digit maps were projected to the cortical surface , to display digit preference maps . Note that no masking was applied when presenting the resulting maps . Within the resulting five-digit map a gradient of progression across digits was visualised , based on the voxel-wise r-values for each of the 30 lags . The resulting map was located in the central sulcus and postcentral gyrus , corresponding to the primary somatosensory cortex , around the anatomical hand knob .

Contrast between phantom ( amputees; A ) or left ( controls; B ) hand movements and baseline ( rest ) in the block design , projected on cortical surfaces of the contralateral hemisphere . Analysis was performed using a standard 2-level general linear model . Amputees and controls showed activation in primary somatosensory and motor cortex ( S1 and M1 , respectively; left panel ) , as well as in the supplementary motor area ( SMA , right panel ) . Note that more inferior areas ( e . g . secondary somatosensory cortex ) were not covered by the partial field of view utilised for the ultra high-field acquisition . White arrows indicate the central sulcus . A = anterior; P = posterior . Displayed activations were thresholded at Z > 2 . These results show that phantom hand movements activate a network of brain areas normally associated with hand movement .

In order to visualise standard topography in the amputees’ somatosensory cortex , topographic mapping was also carried out for the intact hand . For this purpose , task demands were adjusted to optimally activate the somatosensory cortex . Participants were provided with tactile feedback via a MRI-compatible button-box ( manufactured in house ) , placed on the participant’s torso for the duration of the scan . Participants pressed the button box with the relevant digit using a travelling wave paradigm ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . Since this task did not involve any difficulty for the amputees , as it only consisted of moving digits of the intact hand , all participants were paced to perform button press movements with individual digits at a set ( 1 Hz ) frequency , as indicated by the flashing of the corresponding circle at the specified rate . A forward and backward sequence was employed in separate runs . Each of the forward and backward runs was repeated twice , for a total duration of 25 min and 40 s . All other procedures and analysis were as described in the main analysis for the missing hand digit maps ( Figure 1 ) . The black arrows indicate preferences for digits 1–5: thumb ( red ) ; index ( yellow ) ; middle ( green ) ; ring ( blue ) and little finger ( purple ) for the intact hand in amputees ( A ) and two handed controls ( B ) . White arrows indicate the central sulcus . A = anterior; P = posterior . Multiple comparisons were adjusted using false discovery rate ( FDR ) . ( C ) Intra-individual split-half consistency was assessed using the Dice overlap coefficient for the digit maps . 'Same'-digit selective clusters ( dark ) showed significantly greater consistency than 'different'-digit clusters ( light ) in amputees and controls . Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals . Note that the organisation , extent and consistency of the digit maps qualitatively resembled the left ( missing ) hand maps ( obtained using self-paced digit flexion and extension ) found in both controls and amputees ( Figure 1 ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 15292 . 008 A hallmark of a functional sensorimotor system is the distinct representation of the two hands . To further confirm the existence of the missing hand map independently of intact hand contributions ( Makin et al . , 2013b ) , we designed an opposing bimanual travelling wave task . Participants performed paired movements with digits of the phantom and intact hands in reverse sequences ( i . e . one hand moved from digit 1 to digit 5 , while the other simultaneously moved from digit 5 to digit 1; Figure 2A ) . Both amputees showed maps in the hemisphere contralateral to the intact hand , dissociated from a second map in the missing hand hemisphere ( Figure 2B , C ) . The latter map corresponded to the original ( unimanual movements , Figure 1 ) missing hand map , as confirmed by higher spatial correspondence for 'same' ( average Dice overlap coefficient: 0 . 49 , 0 . 40 for above and below elbow amputees ) versus 'different' ( 0 . 06 , 0 . 04 ) digit clusters across the two ( unimanual and bimanual ) missing hand datasets ( Figure 2E ) . This provides a replication for the preserved missing hand map . This result also demonstrates the independence of the missing hand topography from the representation of the intact hand . Our group and others previously showed that following unilateral arm amputation , the intact hand becomes over-represented in the missing hand territory ( Makin et al . , 2013b; Philip and Frey , 2014; Raffin et al . , 2016 ) . Our results therefore confirm that the digit map in the missing hand territory is not driven by an emerging representation of the intact hand . Note , however , that our results do not exclude the possibility for reorganisation in the missing hand territory . As demonstrated in Figure 2—figure supplement 1 , this study’s participants showed over-representation of their intact hand in the missing hand territory , indicating that the preserved missing hand topography can co-occur with remapping of body parts . 10 . 7554/eLife . 15292 . 009Figure 2 . Missing hand maps are replicated during dissociated bimanual hand movements . ( A ) In the bimanual task , individuals performed paired digit movements with both hands , resulting in reversed digit cycles between the hands . The colour code indicates the cycle lag as shown in ( A ) . Symmetrical colour gradients across the two hemispheres would reveal the missing hand map as dependent on intact hand movements ( B: case 1 ) . Colour gradient reversal across hemispheres indicates dissociated hand representations ( B: case 2 ) , as was seen in both amputees and controls ( C , D respectively , left two panels ) . Maps contralateral to the missing hand ( left hand in controls ) resembled the unimanual task maps ( Figure 1 ) , both qualitatively ( C , D , right panel ) and quantitatively , using the Dice overlap coefficient ( E ) . The digit maps were adjusted for multiple comparisons using false discovery rate ( FDR ) . Other annotations are as in Figure 1 .

To investigate whether the observed missing hand maps ( Figure 1 , Figure 4 ) were preserved despite reorganisation of displaced inputs ( as reported previously [Makin et al . , 2013b] ) , we quantified intact hand representation in the territory of the missing hand in the amputees participating in the current study . For this purpose , we employed an independent dataset , acquired using standard field neuroimaging ( acquisition parameters were identical to those described for the standard field imaging in the materials and methods section , with the exception of the number of acquisition volumes ) . ( A ) Participants were cued to perform movements with their intact hand ( simultaneous flexion and extension of all five digits ) , or dominant hand in controls ( n = 15 ) , as part of a block-design protocol , used to identify body-part representations ( see [Makin et al . , 2013b] for details of a similar protocol ) . This movement condition was contrasted against a baseline ( rest ) period and standardised ( z ) beta values during intact/dominant hand movements were extracted from the peak voxel within a postcentral gyrus ( PCG ) mask in the contralateral hemisphere . To identify the estimated position of the missing hand territory , this peak voxel was mirror flipped on the axial plane , and the standardised beta value for intact hand activity was extracted from this ROI in the ipsilateral hemisphere . ( B ) To assess asymmetry in intact hand activity across the two hemispheres , the following inter-hemispheric asymmetry index was calculated for each of the three amputees and 15 controls individually: ( contralateral hemisphere – ipsilateral hemisphere ) / ( contralateral hemisphere + ipsilateral hemisphere ) . Higher values of this index indicate that the activity pattern for the intact hand was greater in the contralateral , compared to the ipsilateral , sensorimotor hand area , as found was in the control participants . Lower values in this index represent less asymmetry , resulting from ( relatively ) higher activity in the ipsilateral hand area during intact hand movements . Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals . The above elbow and brachial plexus amputees showed significantly lower asymmetry than controls ( one-tailed Crawford and Howell t-test [Corballis , 2009]; t ( 14 ) = −1 . 84 , p = 0 . 04; and t ( 14 ) = −1 . 96 , p = 0 . 04 respectively ) . The below elbow amputee showed a high asymmetry value , similar to controls ( one-tailed Crawford and Howell t-test ( Corballis , 2009 ) ; t ( 14 ) = 1 . 26 , p = 0 . 11 ) . This indicates that two of the tested amputees show over-representation of their intact hand in the missing hand territory , as previously reported ( Makin et al . , 2013b ) . These results suggest that the missing hand maps can be preserved while reorganisation of displaced inputs from the intact hand has taken place . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 15292 . 010 While the travelling wave maps demonstrate digit preference , they provide little information about the second principle of digit topography: inter-digit overlap . To study inter-digit overlap , we used pairwise digit representational similarity of multivoxel patterns ( Diedrichsen et al . , 2011 ) . This approach fully reveals the intricate overlap pattern across all digits ( Ejaz et al . , 2015 ) , as shown for controls in Figure 3B , D . In general , both amputees showed greater average overlap across digits ( 0 . 55 and 0 . 54 for above and below elbow amputees respectively ) , compared to controls ( 95% confidence intervals ( CI ) = 0 . 24–0 . 41 ) . However , when examining the inter-digit overlap pattern in the missing hand map , both amputees demonstrated typical patterns ( Figure 3A , C; see Figure 3—figure supplement 1 for intact hand ) . This was reflected in high correlation between each amputee’s inter-digit overlap pattern and the controls , as assessed using a bootstrapping approach ( average rs = 0 . 61 and rs = 0 . 78 , 95% CI = 0 . 25–0 . 89 and 95% CI = 0 . 62–0 . 90 for above and below elbow amputees respectively ) . These average amputee-to-controls Spearman correlation values fell well within the controls-to-controls Spearman correlation range ( 95% CI = 0 . 35–0 . 95; Figure 3C ) , providing further evidence for characteristic missing hand representation decades after amputation . 10 . 7554/eLife . 15292 . 011Figure 3 .

In order to visualise standard topography in the amputees’ somatosensory cortex , inter-digit representational similarity was assessed for multivoxel patterns underlying the right ( intact ) hand maps shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 3 in amputees ( intact hand , A ) and controls ( dominant hand , B ) . To estimate inter-digit representational similarity for the intact hand , the same blocked design as described in the materials and methods section missing hand inter-digit overlap was used . Tactile feedback ( from the button box ) was incorporated into the task to optimally activate the somatosensory cortex . Participants were instructed to perform single digit button presses ( using an MRI-compatible button-box manufactured in house ) with their right intact ( amputees ) or right dominant ( controls ) hand at a 1 Hz frequency . To cue the participant which digit should be moved , the circle corresponding to this digit flashed at the specified 1 Hz rate . Digits 1–5: thumb; index; middle; ring and little finger . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 15292 . 012 Finally , we also studied missing hand representation in a third amputee ( 31 years since amputation ) whose cause of amputation involved a brachial plexus avulsion , abolishing communication between the residual arm and the central nervous system . Due to MRI safety limitations 3 tesla neuroimaging was used ( see Figure 4B for quality comparisons to ultra high-field digit maps ) . Using the bimanual task specified above ( Figure 4A ) we identified digit preference for the missing hand in the postcentral gyrus and central sulcus ( Figure 4C ) . We also identified a typical inter-digit overlap pattern ( Figure 4D ) , as confirmed in comparison with the control population described in Figure 3 ( average Spearman correlation with controls = 0 . 76 , with 95% CI = 0 . 30–0 . 92 ) . This result provides further evidence for the existence of preserved digit topography in the absence of peripheral input . 10 . 7554/eLife . 15292 . 013Figure 4 . Topography is preserved despite the absence of peripheral input . To rule out the potential contribution of peripheral inputs from the injured nerve to preservation of the phantom hand map , we tested an upper-limb amputee suffering from brachial plexus avulsion injury with vivid kinaesthetic phantom digit sensations . This injury involves the tearing of the nerve from its attachment at the spinal cord , abolishing afferent inputs and efferent outputs to the residual limb . 3 tesla MRI was used here due to safety restrictions , meaning that standard field digit preference maps were acquired . The bimanual travelling wave task ( A , Figure 2 ) elicited maps in the controls with reversed colour gradients ( B - left 2 panels ) . In comparison to the ultra high-field left hand maps ( right panel ) , the standard field left hand maps were cruder ( e . g . less digit specificity , B - middle panel ) . ( C ) The brachial plexus amputee showed two maps with reversed colour gradients , comparable to those found in controls . The map in the missing hand hemisphere showed preference for digits in primary somatosensory cortex . ( D ) Inter-digit representational similarity was assessed for multivoxel patterns underlying the missing hand map . The correlation value of the brachial plexus amputee’s inter-digit overlap pattern with the controls exemplified in Figure 3 fell within the normal controls-to-controls correlation range . Together , these results suggest that preserved representation of the missing hand existed independently of peripheral inputs . Other annotations are as in Figure 1 . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 15292 . 013 Together we show that , although the missing hand maps were weaker and noisier than the maps found in controls , the functional digit layout of S1 prevails following arm amputation . Digit topography , previously thought to depend on experience ( Ejaz et al . , 2015; Merzenich et al . , 1984 ) , was detectable despite decades without organised peripheral inputs associated with normal hand function . Our findings call for a reassessment of the role of sensory input in regulating brain organisation and plasticity . By demonstrating characteristic topography of the missing hand decades after arm amputation , our findings reopen the question of what happens to a cortical territory once its main inputs are removed . Textbooks teach us that the cortical territory previously assigned to processing the now lost input is invaded by new representations . For example , following arm amputation , the missing hand territory in S1 is taken over by representations of other body parts ( e . g . the neighbouring representation of the face in monkeys [Pons et al . , 1991] , or the intact hand in humans [Makin et al . , 2013b] ) . Conversely , recent research in the visual cortex suggests that reorganisation in the adult brain may be restricted . For example following macular degeneration , the functional representation of the intact visual field was unchanged ( [Baseler et al . , 2011] , see [Smirnakis et al . , 2005] for similar results in non-human primates ) . Common to all these previous studies aiming to characterise reorganisation or the lack thereof , is that the authors probed the cortical neighbours of the area previously responsible for processing the lost input . While this approach is suitable for documenting shifted representation of the cortical neighbours , it leaves unexplored the possibility that the original function of the region deprived of sensory input may be preserved , though latent . Amputees experiencing phantom sensations provide a unique model to study what happens to the deprived cortical territory itself during sensory input loss . Here we show that reorganisation in the missing hand territory following input loss does not abolish the original functional layout in sensory cortex . How can our finding of preserved S1 topography of a missing hand be allied with the wealth of evidence showing cortical reorganisation in S1 following sensory input loss ? ( e . g . amputation and spinal cord injury [Merzenich et al . , 1984; Pons et al . , 1991; Jain et al . , 2008]; see Figure 2—figure supplement 1 for reorganisation in the current study’s volunteers cohort ) . Already in their seal work Merzenich et al . suggested that reorganisation following sensory input loss does not exclude the possibility for simultaneous preservation of the original function of that region ( Merzenich et al . , 1984 ) . Accordingly , recent structural and functional evidence shows that the capacity for S1 reorganisation is more limited than initially thought , and that instead the functional changes previously observed in S1 following input loss could be attributed to reorganisation in sub-cortical areas in the afferent pathway , principally the brainstem ( Jain et al . , 1998; Kambi et al . , 2014; Chand and Jain , 2015 ) . In other words , previous findings of massive cortical reorganisation in S1 reflect reorganisation of inputs , rather than reorganisation within S1 itself . This recent evident nicely complements our own finding of SI reorganisation , overlaid on preserved structure and function . Which inputs could contribute to the maintenance of the missing hand topography ? The variability in the level and nature of amputations in this study’s cohort allows us to consider the potential contribution of the peripheral nervous system in the preservation of missing hand topography . In the below elbow amputee , some forearm muscles normally controlling hand movements are spared and therefore proprioceptive inputs relating to phantom hand movements likely persist ( Nyström and Hagbarth , 1981 ) . In the above elbow amputee , these inputs would be absent , though ectopic firing from the injured nerve ( Nyström and Hagbarth , 1981 ) or intact dorsal root ganglia could preserve some afferent inputs ( as previously shown following peripheral nerve injury [Nordin et al . , 1984] , see also [Vaso et al . , 2014] for related findings ) . However , in the amputee suffering from brachial plexus avulsion injury , the dorsal root ganglia are damaged , meaning that no such peripheral input should be available . Given the observation of preserved topography in all three cases , it is highly probable that the preserved missing hand maps are not maintained by peripheral input , but rather are driven by processing in the central nervous system itself . What neural signals may be triggering the brain activations subserving the missing hand maps ? Given the relatively unimpaired motor system in amputees , it is possible that these representations are driven by motor ( efferent ) information . The motor system is thought to provide information about its descending commands to the sensory system , by means of efference copy . When efference signals reach the sensory areas , they evoke activity in those areas . The pattern of this corollary discharge could resemble that of the sensory feedback to be expected from the movement ( London and Miller , 2013 ) . While predictive signals are fundamental components for current theories of motor control ( Franklin and Wolpert , 2011 ) , surprisingly little empirical evidence exists to demonstrate efferent signals in the primates’ S1 hand representation independently of afferent processing ( London and Miller , 2013 ) . Our evidence for digit topography in S1 despite the physical absence of a hand suggests the involvement of non-afferent processing in S1 . The persistence of efference signals from the motor system could contribute to the maintenance of preserved information content in SI despite afferent input loss . Our findings are based on the unique phenomenology of phantom sensations , and as such all tested amputees reported experiencing exceptionally vivid phantom sensations , allowing them to voluntarily move each of their phantom fingers . An open question remains whether a relationship exists between the experience of phantom sensations and preserved missing hand topography . Our previous findings , showing that phantom hand movements activate the missing hand territory in individuals experiencing varying levels of phantom sensation vividness ( Makin et al . , 2013a; 2015 ) might indicate that this is a general phenomenon . However , we note that these previous studies do not provide information on whether the topographic features underlying the phantom-evoked activity were preserved . Further research is needed to determine whether the preservation of missing hand topography depends on ( or gives rise to ) the experience of phantom sensations , or whether our finding reflects a fundamental organising principle of the brain that is independent of experience . The notion of brain reorganisation has posed an unexpected obstacle to recent technological developments of human-technology fusion , i . e . neuroprosthetics . Neuroprosthetics allow patients with sensorimotor impairments ( e . g . amputation , paralysis ) to directly interface with a robotic limb using cortical signals of the hand . However , the relevant information necessary for intuitive neuroprosthesis control may not be attainable once input is lost and functional reorganisation occurs . By demonstrating persistence of topography despite input loss , our finding could be exploited to develop intuitive fine-grained control of neuroprosthetics ( Bensmaia and Miller , 2014 ) ( e . g . requiring representation of individual digits ) in disabled populations . 2 Materials and methods The main inclusion criteria for amputees in the study were: ( a ) unilateral upper limb amputation; ( b ) vivid kinaesthetic sensations during voluntary movements of each of the five digits of the phantom hand ( based on self-report ) ; ( c ) compatibility with magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) safety guidelines . We initially screened 63 unilateral upper-limb amputees , of which 22 met the initial criteria for MRI safety . Eight amputees met our 2nd criterion for vividness of kinaesthetic sensations while volitionally moving each of their phantom digits . Only two of these candidates were approved for undergoing ultra high-field ( 7 tesla ) MRI , based on institute’s standard operating procedures for MRI safety . ( Ultra high-field ( 7T ) imaging is a newly emerging technique , and as such most clinical implants ( e . g . surgical clips ) have not been approved for safety in these devices . Therefore , according to current local guidelines it is unsafe to scan individuals who have previously undergone major surgery ( e . g . amputees ) without a conclusive surgical history . ) These amputees were invited to take part in the main study ( see Figure 1—source data 1 , 2 , for demographic and clinical details ) . This involved studying movements of the phantom and intact hands , across two scanning sessions ( see Supplementary file 1 ) . Two additional inclusion criteria were used for a further investigation of peripheral contributions to the missing hand digit topography: ( d ) brachial plexus avulsion injury; ( e ) abolishment of afferent inputs and efferent outputs ( based on behavioural and electromyography ( EMG ) testing , see below for details ) . Three amputees who met criteria a , b and c also met criterion d . Only one of these candidates also met criterion e and was therefore invited to participate in the additional study ( see Figure 1—source data 1 , 2 ) . Because this individual was not approved to undergo ultra high-field MRI , he was tested in a single session at standard field MRI . All three amputees included in the study were amputated on their left arm due to a trauma and were right-hand dominant prior to the amputation ( based on self report ) . In addition , a group of thirteen two-handed control participants with a dominant right hand were recruited to take part in the study ( mean age ± s . e . m . = 43 ± 3; three females ) . All control participants performed tasks with their left ( non-dominant ) hand as a control for the phantom digit movements , in a single session . A subset of six age- and sex-matched control participants ( mean age ± s . e . m . = 50 ± 14; all male ) also completed tasks involving right ( dominant ) hand movements . One of these participants was subsequently excluded from the study due to an atypical functional digit layout of both hands with a reversed representation of the thumb and index finger . Another participant was excluded due to excessive head motion inside the scanner ( greater than the functional voxel dimension ( 1 . 2 mm ) of absolute mean displacement ) , leading to visible spin history artefact . The resulting subset of four control participants ( 45 ± 13; all male: C1 – C4 ) also completed a standard field ( 3 tesla ) version of the study . Participants in this group therefore completed three sessions ( two ultra high-field sessions and one standard field session; see Supplementary file 1 ) . Ethical approval was granted by the NHS National Research Ethics service ( 10/H0707/29 ) and written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to the study . An additional standard field imaging dataset of 15 control participants and the three amputees specified above was also utilised in the current study . The purpose of this analysis was to explore inter-hemispheric ( a ) symmetry of the intact hand . The pertinent details relating to this dataset are highlighted in Figure 2—figure supplement 1 , and will not be detailed further in the materials and methods section . To investigate topographic mapping in the absence of peripheral input , we screened participants with a brachial plexus avulsion injury . This injury involves the tearing of the nerve from its attachment at the spinal cord , abolishing afferent inputs and efferent outputs to the residual limb . To determine the extent of the brachial plexus avulsion injury , we conducted behavioural testing to measure stump sensitivity . Stimuli ranging from light touch to painful pinpricks were applied on the triceps of the residual arm ( stump ) and a corresponding site on the intact arm . Participants were blindfolded and asked to detect the stimuli , which were presented at varying inter-stimulus intervals in the following order: air puff , light brush , cotton swab stroke , PinPrick probes ( MRC systems ) with weights: 8 mN , 64 mN and 512 mN . Each stimulus was presented several times . These stimuli are routinely used for qualitative sensoric testing ( QST ) , a technique used to determine sensitivity to touch and pain ( Rolke et al . , 2006 ) . To assess stump muscle activity we used surface electromyography ( EMG ) . We targeted the biceps and triceps of the residual arm , known to show muscle activity during phantom hand movements in amputees ( Raffin et al . , 2012a ) . All three amputees were able to detect each of the stimuli when presented on their intact arm . Only one of the three tested amputees reporting to suffer from brachial plexus avulsion injury was unable to detect any of the stimuli on the residual arm . This participant also did not reveal a change in the EMG channels induced by cued phantom hand movements . This amputee therefore met our requirement for abolishment of afferent inputs and efferent outputs and was included in the standard field ( 3T ) study . Digit representation was probed using a visually cued active ( motor ) task . In an intact sensorimotor system , movement recruits a combination of peripheral receptors encoding a range of somatosensory modalities ( e . g . surface and deeper mechanoreceptors; proprioceptors ) , as well as efference information from the motor system . Using an active task , we have previously shown high consistency of primary somatosensory ( S1 ) digit topography across multiple scanning sessions ( Kolasinski et al . , 2016 ) . The present study involved functional MRI ( fMRI ) paradigms designed to identify the two principles of topographic mapping of the hand ( Graziano and Aflalo , 2007 ) , as previously shown using neuroimaging: digit selectivity ( Kolasinski et al . , 2016 ) and inter-digit overlap ( Ejaz et al . , 2015 ) . ( 1 ) To identify voxels showing digit preference ( digit maps ) a travelling wave approach was employed ( also known as phase-encoding fMRI ) ( Wandell et al . , 2007 ) . This approach has previously been well-validated for sensory body mapping ( Kolasinski et al . , 2016; Mancini et al . , 2012; Orlov et al . , 2010; Sanchez-Panchuelo et al . , 2010; Sereno and Huang , 2006; Zeharia et al . , 2015 ) . Whereas the travelling wave approach provides detailed information regarding digit preference , the winner-takes-all analysis ( see below ) makes this approach insensitive to overlapping cortical digit representations . Moreover , as the paradigm involves continuous cycles of digit movements with no interruption of baseline periods , regions activated by multiple digits will be difficult to identify using a standard GLM ( Besle et al . , 2013 ) . ( 2 ) To identify the extent of overlap between representations of individual digits ( inter-digit representational similarity ) a block design was therefore also employed . Below we describe the experimental design and analysis in further detail . Participants were presented with five white circles , corresponding to the five digits , shown on a visual display projected into the scanner bore . To cue the participant which digit should be moved , the circle corresponding to this digit changed ( i . e . in colour or by flashing ) . Participants were instructed to perform individual digit movements with either their intact or phantom hand . Volitional ( and not necessarily painful ) movement of a phantom hand elicits both central ( Makin et al . , 2013a; Raffin et al . , 2012b; Makin et al . , 2015; Reilly and Sirigu , 2008 ) and peripheral motor signals ( Reilly et al . , 2006; Raffin et al . , 2012a; Reilly and Sirigu , 2008 ) that are different from those found during imagined movements . It was clearly stated to the amputees that they were required to perform actual movements with their phantom digits ( i . e . try and move the digits of the missing hand ) , rather than motor imagery . To ensure good understanding of these instructions , the amputees were asked to demonstrate to the experimenter outside the scanner the extent of volitional movement carried out in each of their phantom digits , by mirroring each movement onto their intact hand . For the below elbow amputee , stump muscles were palpated by the experimenter outside the scanner to verify that actual movements were executed during movement of the phantom digits . To compare between the amputees and controls , the phantom ( left ) hand was matched to the non-dominant ( left ) hand of control participants , and the intact ( right ) hand was matched to the ( right ) dominant hand of controls . Below we describe the parameters used for the main ( ultra high-field ) study . Adjusted parameters used for the standard field control experiment are mentioned when relevant . MRI analysis was implemented using tools from FSL and Connectome Workbench software ( http://fsl . fmrib . ox . ac . uk/fsl; http://www . humanconnectome . org ) ( Jenkinson et al . , 2012; Woolrich et al . , 2009; Smith et al . , 2004 ) in combination with in house scripts developed using Matlab ( version 8 . 4 , R2014b ) . Cortical surface reconstructions , used for visualisation of the fMRI results , were produced using FreeSurfer ( http://freesurfer . net ) ( Dale et al . , 1999; Fischl et al . , 2001 ) ."}

When the blood sugar content is high , a group of cells in the pancreas release insulin; when it is low , they stop . In these cells , the level of sugar in the blood modifies the ratio of two molecules: ATP , the body’s energy currency , and ADP , a molecule closely related to ATP . Changes in the ATP/ADP ratio are therefore a proxy of the variations in blood sugar levels . In these pancreatic cells , a membrane protein called ATP sensitive potassium channel , KATP channel for short , acts as a switch that turns on and off the production of insulin . ATP and ADP control that switch , with the two molecules having opposite effects on the channel – ATP deactivates it , ADP activates it . The changes in ATP/ADP ratio – and by extension in blood sugar levels – are therefore coupled with the release of insulin . However , how KATP channels sense the changes in the ATP/ADP ratio in these cells is still unclear . In particular , ATP levels are usually high and constant: ATP is then continuously deactivating the channels , and it is unclear how ADP ever activates them . Here , Lee et al . use a microscopy technique that can image biological molecules at the atomic scale to look at the structure of human pancreatic KATP channels . The 3D reconstruction maps show that KATP channels have binding sites for ATP but also one for ADP . This ADP site acts as a sensor that can detect even small changes in ADP levels in the cell . The maps also reveal a dynamic lasso-like structure connecting the ATP and ADP binding areas . This domain may play a vital role in allowing ADP to override ATP’s control of the channel . The presence of the ADP sensor and the lasso structure could explain how KATP channels monitor changes in the ATP/ADP ratio and can therefore control the release of insulin based on blood sugar levels . Defects in the KATP channels of the pancreas are present in genetic diseases where infants produce too much or too little insulin . Understanding the structure of these channels and how they work may help scientists to design new drugs to treat these conditions .", "article": "1 Introduction In 1983 , Akinori Noma made the first recordings of ATP-dependent potassium channels in rat cardiac myocytes ( Noma , 1983 ) . In membrane patches excised from cardiac myocytes , ATP-dependent K+-channels spontaneously open in electrolyte solutions devoid of nucleotides . When exposed to milimolar concentrations of intracellular ATP , these channels become quiescent . Once ATP is removed , the potassium currents re-emerge , thus ATP facilitates channel closure . KATP channels , as they are known , have since been discovered in other cells , including pancreatic beta cells ( Cook and Hales , 1984 ) , skeletal ( Spruce et al . , 1985 ) and smooth muscle ( Standen et al . , 1989 ) fibers and neurons ( Karschin et al . , 1997; Nelson et al . , 2015 ) . Through their selectivity for K+ ions KATP channels return membrane voltage toward the resting ( Nernst K+ ) potential ( Hibino et al . , 2010; Hille , 2001 ) . In addition to ATP , other co-factors also regulate KATP . Mg2+-ADP overrides ATP inhibition ( Dunne and Petersen , 1986; Kakei et al . , 1986; Larsson et al . , 1993; Nichols et al . , 1996 ) and phosphatidyl-inositol diphosphate ( PIP2 ) is required for activity ( Baukrowitz et al . , 1998; Hilgemann and Ball , 1996; Shyng and Nichols , 1998 ) . By virtue of their sensitivity to both ATP and ADP , these channels are thought to couple cellular metabolism to membrane excitability . The physiological importance of KATP channels is underscored by mutations associated with heritable human diseases including congenital hyperinsulinism ( Pinney et al . , 2008; Saint-Martin et al . , 2011; Sharma et al . , 2000 ) and permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus ( Aittoniemi et al . , 2009; Ashcroft et al . , 2017; Letha et al . , 2007 ) . Furthermore , drugs used in the treatment of diabetes mellitis , hypertension and alopecia target KATP channels ( Aziz et al . , 2014; Feldman , 1985; Rubaiy , 2016; Shorter et al . , 2008; Standen et al . , 1989; Sturgess et al . , 1985 ) . A broad and rich body of literature based on decades of study describes the biochemical and functional properties of KATP channels ( Aguilar-Bryan and Bryan , 1999; Aguilar-Bryan et al . , 1998; Ashcroft et al . , 2017; Ashcroft and Ashcroft , 1992; Hibino et al . , 2010; Nichols , 2016; 2006 ) . These channels were found to be large oligomeric complexes composed of four sulphonylurea receptor ( SUR ) subunits , which belong to the ABCC family of ABC transporters , and four Kir6 subunits , which are members of the inward rectifier potassium channel family ( Clement et al . , 1997; Inagaki et al . , 1997; Shyng and Nichols , 1997 ) . This peculiar combination of an ABC transporter and an ion channel has been the focus of extensive study and speculation . Recent cryo-EM structures of hamster SUR1-mouse/rat Kir6 . 2 hybrid complexes presented the architecture of KATP , revealing a central K+ channel surrounded by four SURs ( Li et al . , 2017; Martin et al . , 2017a , 2017b ) . The SURs extended away from the channel , akin to propellers , and their nucleotide-binding domains ( NBDs ) were empty and dissociated from each other . In this study , we analyze human KATP with adenosine nucleotides bound to SUR1 . 2 Results and discussion In humans , there are two SUR genes ( SUR1 and SUR2 ) and two Kir6 genes ( Kir6 . 2 and Kir6 . 1 ) ( Aguilar-Bryan et al . , 1995; Babenko et al . , 1998; Chutkow et al . , 1996; Inagaki et al . , 1995a , Inagaki et al . , 1995b , Inagaki et al . , 1995c ) . The focus of this study is the human KATP channel composed of SUR1 and Kir6 . 2 , which are found in pancreatic beta cells where they play a major role in regulating insulin secretion . To facilitate large-scale expression and purification of the human SUR1-Kir6 . 2 complex , we fused the C-terminus of SUR1 to the N-terminus of Kir6 . 2 using a six-amino acid linker containing three repeats of the Ser-Ala dyad . This strategy allows the production of human SUR1-human Kir6 . 2 complex as a tetramer of the fusion construct . This and other peptide linkers ranging from 6 to 14 residues have been used to generate KATP channel fusions that reproduce the electrophysiological and pharmacological characteristics of wild-type octameric KATP channels , as assessed by inhibition from ATP and sulphonylurea drugs as well as activation by ADP and diazoxide ( Chan et al . , 2008; Clement et al . , 1997; Mikhailov et al . , 2005 , 1998 ) . We also confirmed functional expression of our fusion construct ( KATPem ) in electrophysiology recordings and ATPase measurements ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . For structural studies , KATPem was purified in PMAL-C8 and mixed with Mg2+ , ATP , vanadate , and C8-PIP2 before imaging . Cryo-EM reconstructions revealed two major conformations ( Figure 1A ) . One is similar to the published structure ( ‘propeller’ form ) with the exception that the NBDs are closed in our structure ( Figure 1C ) . The other conformation , which we refer to as the quatrefoil form , is dramatically different ( Figure 1B ) . The NBDs are also closed in the quatrefoil form; however , the SUR1 subunits reside in a different location relative to Kir6 ( Figure 1B and C ) . Upon further classification and refinement , the propeller form was determined to 5 . 6 Å resolution and the quatrefoil form was determined to 3 . 9 Å resolution . The EM map of the quatrefoil form was further improved by focused classification and symmetry expansion as implemented in RELION ( see Materials and methods ) ( Scheres , 2016 ) . Using this approach , we obtained local maps with substantially enhanced resolution , from which we pieced together a composite 3D image of the KATPem particle ( Figure 1B ) . This enabled building of 1596 out of 1977 residues in the complex and assignment of the amino acid register ( Figure 2 ) . In addition , the map was of sufficient quality to identify ligands including Mg2+ , ATP , and ADP . In the quatrefoil form , KATP is a symmetrical tetramer; each protomer consists of one K+ channel subunit and one ABC transporter . There are five domains in the ABC transporter , TMD0 , TMD1 , NBD1 , TMD2 and NBD2 ( Figure 2A ) . The latter four domains form the transporter module . The K+ channel consists of a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic domain ( CTD ) , which form the ion pathway through the complex ( Figure 2B ) . At the molecular center , the four subunits of Kir6 . 2 form a canonical inward-rectifier K+ channel structure ( Figures 1B and 2B ) . The TMD0s are bound to the channel and hold the four ABC transporters akin to the leaves of a quatrefoil . EM density of the entire complex is very well defined , but residues 193–261 , known as the L0-loop , containing a conserved lasso motif ( Johnson and Chen , 2017; Li et al . , 2017; Martin et al . , 2017b; Zhang and Chen , 2016 ) is not visible ( Figure 2 ) . A focused 3D classification and refinement strategy coupled with symmetry expansion was also employed to improve the propeller form reconstruction ( Figure 1—figure supplement 6 ) . Although the final propeller form EM map is of lower resolution than that of the quatrefoil form , secondary structural elements are well defined ( Figure 1C ) . Each domain of the KATP maintains the same structure in both quatrefoil and propeller forms ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) . The major difference between the two structures lies in the different positions of the transporter module relative to the molecular center ( Figure 1B and C; Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) . In addition , the L0-loop is clearly visible in the propeller form albeit at lower resolution ( Figure 1C and Figure 1—figure supplement 7 ) . We further note that the distance between the C-terminus of SUR1 and the first visible residue of Kir6 . 2 ( Arg32 ) in the propeller form is 64 . 2 Å , which is even greater than the corresponding distance in a recent propeller KATP structure without bound Mg2+-nucleotides ( 59 . 4 Å , PDB ID: 5TWV ) ( Martin et al . , 2017b ) . Assuming the Cα-Cα distance of adjacent residues in an extended strand spans 3 . 5 Å ( Berg et al . , 2002 ) , the maximum distance spanned by the disordered region connecting the C-terminus of SUR1 and Kir6 . 2 Arg32 ( 37 a . a . total , including the ( SA ) 3 linker ) is 118 . 4 Å , which exceeds the observed distances mentioned above by ~2-fold . Thus , we do not expect the six-amino acid linker used in the KATPem construct to limit the range of motion sampled by SUR1 and Kir6 . 2 or introduce unnatural distortions to the propeller or quatrefoil forms . Moreover , the fusion construct is functional and sensitive to nucleotides ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . The transporter module of SUR1 resembles a canonical ABC transporter , TMD1 and TMD2 are domain-swapped , with TM9-10 from TMD1 and TM15-16 from TMD2 reaching across the interface between half-transporters to pack against the neighboring TMD ( Figure 3A ) . The NBDs dimerize in a head-to-tail fashion and nucleotides occupy both ATPase active sites at the dimer interface . In an ABC transporter that functions through the principle of alternating access ( Jardetzky , 1966 ) , a translocation pathway opens to the extracellular space upon NBD dimerization ( Dawson and Locher , 2007 ) . By contrast , in the NBD-dimerized SUR1 , a small cavity inside the TMDs is closed off from the extracellular milieu and remains accessible from the cytoplasm ( Figure 3A ) . These features are consistent with SUR1 being a regulator of a K+ channel rather than a bona fide transporter itself . This notion is further supported by the observation that no substrate has been identified for SUR1 hitherto ( Aittoniemi et al . , 2009; Schwappach et al . , 2000 ) . Whether the transporter transitions to the outside-open conformation as part of the KATP gating cycle awaits further investigation . Another unusual feature of SUR1 is the asymmetric configuration of the NBD dimer . Mg2+-ATP is bound in the ‘closed’ catalytically inactive degenerate site and Mg2+-ADP is bound in the ‘open’ catalytically competent consensus ATPase site ( Figure 3B–D , Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) . To our knowledge , this is the only ABC transporter observed with both Mg2+-ADP and Mg2+-ATP bound in its NBDs . We note that the structure of a dimeric ABC transporter , AaPrtD , shows Mg2+-ADP bound to both sites , but in this case both sites are the same and symmetrically closed around Mg2+-ADP ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2 ) . In the structure determination of KATP , no ADP was added to the sample . While some ADP must have been generated through hydrolysis , it is clear that the degenerate ATP-binding site on SUR1 and the ATP inhibitory site on the channel are occupied by ATP . Thus , the consensus site on SUR1 , relative to the other ATP sites in the complex , is selective for ADP ( see below ) . A simplified reaction scheme for the consensus ATP site ( S ) in SUR1 can be written as S + ATP ↔ SATP ↔ S’ATP→ S’ADP +Pi ↔ S’+ADP . Here , the hydrolysis reaction is approximated as irreversible . We know from the rate of ATP hydrolysis ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1C ) that the ATP turnover rate , expressed per SUR1 molecule , is approximately 0 . 02 per second , which means the above reaction takes approximately 50 s to undergo a complete cycle . The structure shows a relatively open cleft between bound ADP and solution , therefore ADP dissociation is likely to be much faster than this slow turnover rate of 0 . 02 per second . A different transition must limit the overall rate . The slow transition is likely to be either the isomerization step from NBD open to NBD closed conformation ( SATP ↔ S’ATP ) or the hydrolysis step ( S’ATP→ S’ADP + Pi ) . Base on this reasoning , the occupancy of S’ by ADP must reflect equilibration of the site by ADP in solution ( i . e . through a rapid , reversible ADP dissociation reaction , S’ADP ↔ S’ + ADP ) . The prior observation that channel gating does not exhibit violation of microscopic reversibility is also compatible with this assertion ( Choi et al . , 2008 ) . We will return to the significance of this observation and its consistency with prior studies ( Dunne and Petersen , 1986; Dunne et al . , 1988; Kakei et al . , 1986; Nichols et al . , 1996; Tantama et al . , 2013 ) when we consider the mechanism KATP’s ability to sense the metabolic state of a cell . SUR1 is the target of sulphonylureas that inhibit KATP to promote insulin secretion ( Aguilar-Bryan et al . , 1995; Ashcroft et al . , 1987; Bryan et al . , 2005; Dean and Matthews , 1968; Sturgess et al . , 1985 ) . In a recent structure of the hamster-rat KATP hybrid , the glibenclamide-binding site was shown to reside within the TMDs of the inward-facing ( i . e . NBD open ) transporter module ( Martin et al . , 2017a ) ( Figure 3E ) . In the NBD-dimerized form , residues that comprise the glibenclamide-binding pocket move closer towards each other , making the cavity too small to accommodate glibenclamide ( Figure 3E ) . This observation is entirely consistent with the hypothesis that glibenclamide stabilizes the inward-facing conformation ( Martin et al . , 2017a ) . It functions as a wedge to prevent adenosine nucleotide-mediated NBD closure and thus prevents SUR-mediated regulation of channel activity . EM density for the Kir6 . 2 channel is shown in Figure 4A to illustrate the quality of the map in this region of the transporter-channel complex . Excellent side chain density is observed in both the pore and CTD , which have allowed us to build most of the channel except for disordered flexible regions in the N- and C-termini of Kir6 . 2 ( Figure 4B ) . The overall structure of human Kir6 . 2 is that of an inward-rectifier K+-channel with a large cytoplasmic domain . In this structure , both the inner helix gate and the G-loop gates are closed ( Figure 4B and Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) . No PIP2 density was observed in the putative PIP2 binding sites even though C8-PIP2 was present in the sample . By contrast PIP2 was present in Kir2 and GIRK inward rectifiers at similar concentrations ( Hansen et al . , 2011; Whorton and MacKinnon , 2011 ) . Its absence in the KATP structure suggests that ATP , which is known to negatively regulate PIP2-mediated activation , may have prevented PIP2 binding ( Baukrowitz et al . , 1998; Shyng and Nichols , 1998 ) . Four ATP molecules are associated with the Kir6 . 2 channel ( one ATP per subunit ) ; each binds in a shallow pocket on the surface of the CTD ( Figure 4 ) . Density for ATP is unambiguous ( Figure 4D ) . Residues N48 and R50 from a neighboring subunit make two hydrogen bonds with the Watson-Crick edge of the adenine base . These interactions likely account for the specific recognition of ATP versus GTP ( Schwanstecher et al . , 1994; Tucker et al . , 1998 ) ( Figure 4C ) . This same principle of nucleotide selectivity is observed in protein kinases in which main chain atoms of an inter-domain linker decode the Watson-Crick edge of the incoming ATP co-substrate ( Knighton et al . , 1991 ) . Out of the 14 residues that constitute the ATP binding site , mutation of seven are associated with diabetes mellitus , underscoring the physiological importance of ATP regulation ( Edghill et al . , 2010; Gloyn et al . , 2004; Lang and Light , 2010; Proks et al . , 2004 ) . Notably , G334 and N335 are uniquely found in the Kir6 members of the inward rectifier family ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2 ) . In GIRK , the residue analogous to G334 is replaced by histidine , which likely prevents ATP binding by steric hindrance ( Drain et al . , 1998; Masia et al . , 2007 ) . These features help to explain why among inward rectifiers Kir6 is uniquely sensitive to ATP . Three naturally occurring ligands control the activity of KATP channels: PIP2 is required for activity ( Hilgemann and Ball , 1996 ) , ATP inhibits activity ( Inagaki et al . , 1995a; Noma , 1983; Rorsman and Trube , 1985 ) , and ADP potentiates activity ( Dunne and Petersen , 1986 ) . All three of these ligands act in a dependent fashion . ATP in functional experiments appears to negatively regulate the action of PIP2 ( Baukrowitz et al . , 1998; Shyng and Nichols , 1998 ) and ADP appears to override ATP inhibition ( Dunne and Petersen , 1986; Kakei et al . , 1986; Larsson et al . , 1993; Nichols et al . , 1996 ) . We observe a structural interconnectedness of the ATP-binding site , PIP2-binding site and SUR - which is the seat of ADP binding - that seems relevant to their functional dependence . One side of the inhibitory ATP-binding site on Kir6 . 2 is formed by the N-terminal polypeptide segment that leads to the interfacial ‘slide’ helix ( Figures 4C and 5A ) . A local structural comparison of Kir6 . 2 and GIRK ( Whorton and MacKinnon , 2011 ) shows that these structural elements are shifted in Kir6 . 2 , presumably to accommodate binding of ATP as residues N48 and R50 reside in this region ( Figures 4C and 5A , Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) . The shift compresses the PIP2-binding site in Kir6 . 2 compared to GIRK . This compression , if it occurs dynamically when ATP binds , offers a plausible explanation for ATP inhibition through competition with the essential ligand PIP2 . While ATP inhibition is intrinsic to Kir6 . 2 ( Tucker et al . , 1997 ) , SUR1 exerts two opposing influences on ATP inhibition . First , the presence of SUR1 ( compared to Kir6 . 2 expressed in its absence ) enhances the potency of ATP inhibition ( Tucker et al . , 1997 ) . Second , SUR1 permits Mg2+-ADP to override ATP inhibition ( Nichols et al . , 1996; Tucker et al . , 1997 ) . The structures of the quatrefoil and propeller forms provide clues as to how SUR1 might accomplish these tasks . In the propeller form the ATP-binding site on Kir6 . 2 is buttressed by the lasso extension , which attaches SUR1 to the CTD ( Figure 5B ) . Because of the lasso extension’s close proximity to the ATP-binding site it might influence ATP binding . This could account for the fact that SUR1 coexpression potentiates ATP inhibition of KATP by a factor more than 10-fold ( Tucker et al . , 1997 ) . It could also provide the structural pathway through which ADP binding to SUR overcomes ATP inhibition to activate KATP . Functional data are consistent with this possibility . The lasso extension and adjacent amino acids within the ATP-binding site ( i . e . both sides of the interface between Kir6 . 2 and SUR1 ) are hotspots for inherited gain-of-function mutations , which cause diabetes owing to over-activity of KATP channels ( Edghill et al . , 2010; Gloyn et al . , 2004; Lang and Light , 2010; Proks et al . , 2004 ) . Furthermore , when this interface is locked together by a disulfide cross-link , KATP is permanently inhibited ( Pratt et al . , 2012 ) ( Figure 5B ) . While a mechanistic description of how SUR regulates Kir6 is still unknown , the structure of the lasso extension/ATP-binding site interface and its correlation to disease-causing mutations underscores its potential importance . Formation of the quatrefoil form is associated with disruption of the lasso extension/ATP-binding site interface . SUR1 remains attached to Kir6 . 2 through its TMD0-channel interface , but rotation of the transport module around the central axis of TMD0 ( to convert from propeller to quatrefoil forms ) can only occur if the lasso extension releases from its contact adjacent to the ATP site on the CTD . We do not know whether disruption of this interface is an artifact of the preparation or is a normal occurrence during channel gating . Our rationale for even considering the latter possibility is based on a striking difference between the propeller and quatrefoil structures depicted in Figure 6 . In the propeller form , in which the lasso extension/Kir6 interface is intact , the SUR1 transporter modules are held with an offset with respect to the hydrophobic membrane plane , as defined by the position of the Kir6 . 2 channel and TMD0 domains ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1 ) . In the quatrefoil form , the SUR1 transport modules reside coplanar , that is , in the same hydrophobic plane as defined by the Kir6 and TMD0 elements ( Figure 6 ) . The consequence of holding the transport modules at a shifted position with respect to the pore in the propeller form should be strain exerted on the lasso extension/Kir6 interface in the propeller form . When we compare the NBD-dimerized propeller form in this study with the published NBD-open propeller form ( Li et al . , 2017; Martin et al . , 2017b ) , we observe that dimerization causes a slight tilting of NBD1 away from the center of the complex ( Figure 6—figure supplement 2 ) . Thus , dimerization appears to exert force on the lasso extension away from the channel . In this manner , nucleotide binding and dimerization of the NBDs could potentially interfere with ATP inhibition . Whether the lasso extension actually dissociates is unknown . The gain-of-function mutations on the lasso extension that should tend to disrupt the interface , and the cross-link that should stabilize it , seem to support the idea that the interface is dynamic ( Edghill et al . , 2010; Lang and Light , 2010; Pratt et al . , 2012 ) . Whether or not it is dynamic to the extent that it relinquishes its contact with the channel , we think it likely that dimerization of the NBDs acts through the lasso extension to activate the channel . The observation of ADP at the SUR1 consensus site is significant . This finding , together with the prior demonstration that channel gating is not coupled to ATP hydrolysis ( i . e . gating never appears to violate microscopic reversibility ) , supports the idea that SUR1 is an ADP sensor ( Aittoniemi et al . , 2009; Choi et al . , 2008; Dunne et al . , 1988; Dunne and Petersen , 1986; Gribble et al . , 1997; Kakei et al . , 1986; Larsson et al . , 1993; Proks et al . , 2010; Tantama et al . , 2013 ) . Because the affinity of the consensus site for ADP appears to be higher than for ATP , the channel can potentially sense small changes in ADP levels even in the setting of physiological ATP concentrations . In the quatrefoil form , we observe a new interface formed between SUR1 and the Kir6 . 2 CTD near the ADP-binding site ( Figure 6—figure supplement 3 ) . Perhaps relevant to this observation , mutation of a single glycine residue to arginine at this interface , found in patients with Congenital Hyperinsulinism completely destroys the stimulatory effect of MgADP in the presence of ATP ( de Wet et al . , 2012; Stanley et al . , 2004 ) . Further study is required to determine whether this interaction is significant to channel gating . 3 Materials and methods Human embryonic kidney ( HEK ) cells were cultured in DMEM ( GIBCO , Gaithersburg , MD ) medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at ( FBS ) 37°C . Sf9 cells were cultured in Sf-900 II SFM medium ( GIBCO ) at 28°C . HEK293S GnTI- cells cultured in Freestyle 293 medium ( GIBCO ) supplemented with 2% FBS at 37°C . Cell lines were acquired from and authenticated by American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC , Manassas , VA ) . The cell lines were not tested for mycoplasma contamination . Synthetic cDNAs encoding human SUR1 and human Kir6 . 2 were initially cloned into pEG BacMam vectors containing a C-terminal GFP ( Goehring et al . , 2014 ) . Next , we generated a fusion construct in which the C-terminus of SUR1 was linked to the N-terminus of Kir6 . 2 through a linker consisting 3x ( Ser-Ala ) . To facilitate protein detection and purification , a GFP tag was appended to the C-terminus of KATPem with an intervening PreScission protease cleavage site and cloned into a pEG BacMam vector . Human embryonic kidney ( HEK ) cells were cultured on coverslips placed in six-well plates . The cells in each well were transfected with synthetic cDNAs encoding human SUR1 , human Kir6 . 2 , or human KATPem cloned into pEG BacMam vectors containing a C-terminal GFP tag using Lipofectamine 3000 ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . After 36–48 hr , the coverslips were transferred to a recording chamber for patch clamp experiments . In whole-cell recordings , the bath solution in the recording chamber contained 5 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 4 , 100 mM NaCl , 2 . 6 mM CaCl21 . 2 mM MgCl2 , and 40 mM KCl; micropipettes were filled with internal solution containing 5 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 2 , 107 mM KCl , 10 mM EGTA , 1 . 2 mM MgCl2 , and 1 . 0 mM CaCl2 . For inside-out recordings , both the bath and micropipettes were filled with 10 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 4 , 140 mM KCl , 2 . 6 mM CaCl21 . 2 mM MgCl2 . Boroscilicate micropipettes were pulled and fire polished . Recording pipettes had a resistance of 2–4 MΩ . Recordings were performed at room temperature using an Axopatch 200B amplifier , a Digidata 1550 digitizer , and pCLAMP software ( Molecular Devices ) . The recordings were low-pass filtered at 1 kHz and sampled at 20 kHz . Human KATPem was expressed in HEK293S GnTI− cells using the BacMam method . In brief , bacmids encoding the Human KATPem-GFP fusion were generated using DH10Bac cells according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Bacmam baculoviruses were produced using Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 cells cultured in SF900II SFM medium . For protein expression , suspension cultures of HEK293S GnTI- cells cultured in Freestyle 293 medium were infected with bacmam baculovirus at a density of ~3×106 cells/ml . After 24 hr at 37°C , the infected cultures were supplemented with 10 mM sodium butyrate and grown for a further 48 hr at 30°C before harvesting . All subsequent manipulations were performed at 4°C . For large-scale purification , cell pellets from 4 L of culture were pooled and resuspended in lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-Cl , pH 8 . 5 , 500 mM KCl , 1 mM EDTA , 2 mM DTT and supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors ( Tao et al . , 2009 ) . The cell suspension was subject to gentle mechanical disruption in a Dounce homogenizer and the resulting lysate was clarified at 39800 x g for 30 min . The crude membrane pellet obtained was resuspended once again in lysis buffer using a few strokes in the Dounce homogenizer and the membrane suspension was stirred for 2 hr in the presence of 1 . 5% ( w/v ) lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol ( LMNG ) and 0 . 3% ( w/v ) cholesteryl hemisuccinate ( CHS ) . The solubilized membranes were clarified by centrifugation at 39800 x g for 45 min and the resulting supernatant was mixed with GFP nanobody-coupled sepharose resin ( prepared in-house ) by rotation . After 60 min , the resin was collected and washed with 20 column volumes of wash buffer containing 20 mM Tris-Cl , pH 8 . 5 , 300 mM KCl , 1 mM DTT , 1 mM MgCl2 , 0 . 5 mM CaCl2 , 0 . 1% ( w/v ) digitonin and 0 . 01% ( w/v ) phospholipids ( POPC:POPE:POPG = 3:1:1; CEG311 ) . Elution of Human KATPem from the GFP nanobody resin was performed by overnight incubation with PreScission protease . The eluted protein was concentrated and then exchanged into amphipols by mixing with PMAL-C8 at amphipol:protein = 10:1 ( w/w ) overnight . The protein:detergent:amphipol mixture was then diluted 10-fold with detergent-free ( DF ) buffer ( 20 mM Tris-Cl , pH 8 . 5 , 300 mM KCl ) and concentrated once again to a volume of ~500 uL prior to fractionation on a Superose6 column equilibrated with DF buffer ( 20 mM Tris-Cl , pH 8 . 5 , 300 mM KCl , ) . Peak fractions were collected and diluted to their final target concentrations before imaging by cryo-EM . An NADH-coupled fluorimetric assay was used to measure ATPase activity ( Scharschmidt et al . , 1979 ) . Mg2+-ATP was added to a mixture containing 3 . 4 μM KATPem , 50 mM Tris-Cl , pH 8 . 0 , 300 mM KCl , 30 mM MgCl2 , 0 . 5 mM CaCl2 , 0 . 1% ( w/v ) digitonin and 0 . 01% ( w/v ) phospholipids ( POPC:POPE:POPG = 3:1:1; CEG311 ) , 60 μg/mL pyruvate kinase , 32 μg/mL lactate dehydrogenase , 4 mM phosphoenolpyruvate , and 300 μM NADH . Consumption of NADH was measured by monitoring the fluorescence at λex = 340 nm and λem = 445 nm using an Infinite M1000 microplate reader ( Tecan , Switzerland ) . Rates of ATP hydrolysis were calculated by subtracting the rate of fluorescence loss in the absence of KATPem and converting fluorescence loss to nmol NADH per minute using known standards of NADH . Data were then fit by nonlinear regression to the Michaelis-Menten equation to calculate KM and Vmax values using GraphPad Prism . Purified human KATPem in DF buffer was diluted to ~0 . 45 mg/mL using DF buffer and supplemented with 9 mM MgCl2 , 8 mM ATP , 0 . 5 mM Na3VO4 and 150 μM C8-PIP2 . The supplemented protein sample was incubated at room temperature for ~3 hr and passed through a 0 . 45-µm filter to remove debris . To prepare cryo-EM grids , 3 . 5 uL drops of supplemented and filtered human KATPem were applied to glow-discharged Quantifoil R1 . 2/1 . 3 400 mesh Au grids . The grids were blotted for 4 s following an incubation period of 15 s at 4°C and 100% humidity before being plunge-frozen in liquid ethane using a Vitrobot Mark IV ( FEI , Hillsboro , OR ) . The grids were imaged using a Titan Krios transmission electron microscope ( FEI ) operated at 300 keV . Automated data collection was performed using SerialEM ( Mastronarde , 2003 ) . A K2 Summit direct electron detector ( Gatan , Pleasanton , CA ) was used to record micrographs in super-resolution counting mode with a super-resolution pixel size of 0 . 65 Å . Images were recorded for 10 s over 40 frames using a dose-rate of 8 electrons per pixel per second with a defocus range of 0 . 9 to 2 . 5 µm . The total cumulative dose was ~47 electrons per Å2 ( ~1 . 18 electrons per Å2 per frame ) . Dose-fractionated super-resolution movies were 2 × 2 down-sampled by Fourier cropping to a final pixel size of 1 . 3 Å . The down-sampled movie frames were used for grid-based motion correction and dose-filtering with MotionCor2 ( Zheng et al . , 2017 ) . CTF parameters were estimated from the corrected movie frames using CTFFIND4 . 1 ( Rohou and Grigorieff , 2015 ) . Motion-corrected dose-filtered movie sums were used for interactive and automated particle picking in EMAN2 ( Tang et al . , 2007 ) . The entire dataset was also manually inspected to eliminate micrographs exhibiting imaging defects including excessive drift , cracked ice or defocus values exceeding the specified range . An initial set of 675 , 202 particles was obtained from 3179 images . Particle images were extracted from the motion-corrected dose-filtered images as 300 × 300 pixel boxes in RELION ( Kimanius et al . , 2016; Scheres , 2012 ) . 2D classification in RELION was performed to remove spurious images of ice , carbon support and other debris , reducing the particle count to 404 , 205 . We refer to this reduced set of particle images as the ‘2D filtered’ particle set . Ab initio 3D classification was performed using stochastic gradient descent and branch-and-bound algorithms implemented in cryoSPARC ( Punjani et al . , 2017 ) with C4 symmetry imposed ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ) . Of the three classes obtained , two classes , containing 60% ( Class A , quatrefoil form; 169 , 766 particles ) and 18% ( Class B , propeller form; 72 , 757 ) of the input particles displayed clear protein features . The remaining class was uninterpretable . The quatrefoil class was refined in cryoSPARC with a reported gold-standard FSC resolution of 3 . 6 Å but the quality of the density for the SUR1 transporter was rather poor . Refinement of the propeller class in cryoSPARC produced a map with reported resolution of 4 . 0 Å , but it too was characterized by weak density in the SUR1 transporter . We then tested whether using a different image processing strategy could produce a better result . Using the ‘2D filtered’ particle set as the initial input and the ab initio quatrefoil map from cryoSPARC ( low-pass filtered to 60 Å ) as the starting reference model , we performed iterative cycles of 3D refinement and 3D classification without alignment in RELION . A final round of local refinement was performed in RELION with a soft mask to exclude the amphipol belt surrounding the transmembrane portion of the particle . Over-fitting and over-estimation of resolution introduced by masking was estimated by the high-resolution noise substitution procedure implemented in RELION and the resulting corrected unbiased gold-standard FSC resolution estimates are reported . This procedure resulted in a quatrefoil form reconstruction at FSC = 0 . 143 resolution of 3 . 9 Å ( Class 1; 47282 particles ) after masking ( Figure 1—figure supplements 2 , 3A ) . We observed improved helical density in the transporter module of SUR1 in Class 1 compared to the quatrefoil class from cryoSPARC ( Class A ) . However , the density in the SUR1 NBDs remained weak and poorly resolved , which indicated structural heterogeneity and breakdown of symmetry in that region . Recent advances in statistical image processing methods allow the classification of structural heterogeneity and the recovery of improved local 3D information from inhomogeneous samples exhibiting pseudo-symmetry ( Scheres , 2016; Zhou et al . , 2015 ) . To improve the Class 1 reconstruction , we divided the cryo-EM density map into eight overlapping sectors for focused 3D classification and focused 3D refinement in RELION ( Figure 1—figure supplement 4 ) . The sectors chosen are follows: ( 1 ) Kir6 . 2 CTD tetramer; ( 2 ) Kir6 . 2 channel tetramer; ( 3 ) Kir6 . 2 channel tetramer and four TMD0; ( 4 ) Kir6 . 2 channel tetramer , four TMD0 and one transporter module ( TMD1 , TMD2 , NBD1 and NBD2 ) ; ( 5 ) two TMD0 and one transporter module; ( 6 ) one transporter module; ( 7 ) one CTD tetramer and one NBD dimer ( NBD1 + NBD2 ) ; ( 8 ) one NBD dimer . Soft masks corresponding to these eight sectors were created using relion_mask_create from the RELION package . For sectors 1 to 3 , C4 symmetry was enforced during focused 3D classification ( without alignment ) and focused 3D refinement in RELION . For sectors 4 to 8 , the Class 1 particle stack were first artificially expanded 4-fold according to C4 circular symmetry using the RELION command relion_particle_symmetry_expand ( Scheres , 2016 ) . The symmetry expanded particle stack was then used as input for masked 3D classification and masked 3D refinement in RELION with the focus masks corresponding to sectors 4 to 8 . Masked 3D classification was performed without alignment and masked local refinement was performed to optimize alignment parameters . The masked 3D classification and refinement steps were iterated until no further improvement to the reconstructions was observed by manual inspection . For all of the focus maps obtained by this approach , we found significant enhancement to observable features and reported resolution compared to the initial map ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3 ) . The quality of the focus maps allowed the identification and modeling bound ligands including ATP , Mg2+-ATP and Mg2+-ADP as described in the main text . To facilitate map interpretation , we merged focus maps corresponding to all eight sectors into a single composite map using the compositing algorithm implemented in REFMAC5 ( Murshudov , 2016 ) . The resultant composite map encompasses the Kir6 . 2 channel tetramer , four TMD0 and one transporter module , which is equivalent to the volume enclosed in sector 4 . The final composite map was sharpened by scaling to the synthetic map calculated from the refined atomic model using diffmap . exe ( http://grigoriefflab . janelia . org/diffmap ) . The half-map equivalent of the composite map was prepared according to the procedure described above except half-maps from focused 3D refinements were used in lieu of the full-maps . To generate the symmetrized composite map shown in Figure 1B and Figure 1—figure supplement 3B , the region corresponding to the human KATPem construct ( one SUR1 subunit followed by one Kir6 . 2 subunit ) was isolated from the sharpened composite map using UCSF chimera ( Pettersen et al . , 2004 ) and symmetrized using e2proc3d . py ( Tang et al . , 2007 ) . Local resolution was estimated using blocres with a box size of 18 ( Heymann and Belnap , 2007 ) . Representative sections of the cryo-EM density in the quatrefoil form reconstruction are shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 5 . Finally , we compared the symmetrized composite map with the map prior to masked 3D refinement and symmetry expansion ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3A and B ) . The FSC between the two maps shows a correlation at FSC = 0 . 5 to 6 . 3 Å indicating that the symmetry expansion , focused refinement and map compositing steps did not introduced global distortions ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3C ) . We applied a similar focused 3D classification and refinement with symmetry expansion to improve the initial propeller form reconstruction from cryoSPARC ( Class B , see Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ) . Briefly , particles corresponding to the propeller form Class B were subjected to additional rounds of ab initio 3D classification . A single class corresponding to 16 , 070 of the starting 72 , 757 particles displayed improved protein features in the SUR1 portion of the particle . This reconstruction was low-pass filtered to 60 Å and was used as the initial model to refine the stack of 16 , 070 particles in RELION , which resulted in a reconstruction at FSC = 0 . 143 resolution of 5 . 6 Å after masking ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ) . To further improve the propeller reconstruction , iterative focused 3D classification and refinement was performed in RELION using focus masks covering two overlapping sectors: ( 1 ) one SUR1 subunit ( 2 ) Kir6 . 2 channel tetramer and four TMD0 domains ( Figure 1—figure supplement 6 ) . Symmetry expansion was performed before focused classification and refinement in Sector 1 . Representative sections of the cryo-EM density in the propeller form reconstruction are shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 7 . Composite maps ( full maps and half maps ) of the propeller form were prepared according to the procedure described above for the quatrefoil form reconstruction . Model building was initially performed in the focus maps corresponding to the quatrefoil form because of their higher quality . The cryo-EM structure of bovine MRP1 ( PDB: 5UJA ) was used as a reference structure to generate the starting model for building the SUR1 transporter module . Briefly , the MRP1 model ( without TMD0 ) was first mutated to match the SUR1 sequence using CHAINSAW ( Stein , 2008 ) while keeping only side chains of conserved residues . The model was then divided into two pieces , each corresponding to one half transporter ( one TMD plus one NBD ) . The SUR1 half transporters were then docked into EM density separately by rigid-body fitting using the fitmap function in UCSF Chimera ( Pettersen et al . , 2004 ) followed by manual rebuilding in Coot ( Emsley et al . , 2010 ) . To build the SUR1 TMD0 domain , the EM density in the focus maps was of sufficient quality to allow de novo manual building in Coot . The crystal structure of GIRK ( PDB: 3SYA ) was used a reference structure to generate the starting model for building the Kir6 . 2 tetramer . CHAINSAW was again used to mutate the GIRK model to match the Kir6 . 2 sequence and eliminating non-conserved side chains . The Kir6 . 2 pore module and CTD were separated and converted to tetramers by applying the appropriate symmetry operations . The pore and CTD tetramer models were then rigid-body fitted independently into EM density in UCSF Chimera to allow for rotation of the CTD relative to the pore . The fitted Kir6 . 2 models were then used as starting points for manual rebuilding in Coot . The SUR1 transporter , the TMD0 domain , and the Kir6 . 2 tetramer channel were first built as independent initial models by consulting all available focus maps . B-factor sharpening was performed locally in Coot ‘on-the-fly’ to optimize observable map features for model building . Side chains were not modeled for residues with poor density . The initial models were then merged into a single consensus model containing the Kir6 . 2 channel tetramer , four TMD0 domains and one transporter module . Composite maps of the quatrefoil ( one full map and two half maps ) were then prepared as described above . Prior to automatic real space refinement , one additional round of manual rebuilding in Coot was then performed using the consensus model and the composite full map . Automatic real space refinement of the consensus model was performed against one of the composite half-maps using phenix . real_space_refine ( Adams et al . , 2010 ) with 4-fold symmetry imposed for the Kir6 . 2 channel tetramer and the four TMD0 with the application of NCS constraints . Tight secondary structure and geometric restraints were used to minimize overfitting . Manual rebuilding in Coot was alternated with automated refinement in phenix . real_space_refine . For cross-validation , FSC curves were calculated between refined models and the composite half-map used for refinement ( FSCwork ) or the composite half-map not used at any point during refinement ( FSCfree ) ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3D ) . These curves were inspected after each round of automated real-space refinement in phenix . real_space_refine to monitor the effects of overfitting . Regions that did not allow accurate establishment of amino acid register were modeled as a polyalanines . Regions with weak or no density were not modeled and are indicated by dashed lines in Figure 2A . The quality of the final model was evaluated by MolProbity ( Chen et al . , 2010 ) and EMRinger ( Barad et al . , 2015 ) ( Table 1 ) . Model building into the propeller form reconstruction made use of the atomic model built into the higher quality quatrefoil reconstruction . The Kir6 . 2 pore , the CTD , the TMD0 and transporter module from the quatrefoil form coordinates were independently docked into the propeller form reconstruction by rigid-body fitting . The agreement between the fitted models and the propeller form EM density was excellent and required little additional adjustment . The L0-loop in SUR1 , which contains the lasso helix , the lasso motif and the lasso extension was ordered in the propeller form map , in contrast to the quatrefoil form . Given that the sequence of the lasso-motif in SUR1 and MRP1 is well conserved , we reasoned that the structure of this region in SUR1 should be very similar to that observed in MRP1 . To build the lasso-motif in the propeller form density , we extracted the coordinates of the lasso-motif from the bMRP1 model ( residues 205 to 248 ) and mutated it to match the SUR1 sequence using CHAINSAW while keeping sidechains of only conserved residues . This initial model ( corresponding to residues 215 to 255 in SUR1 ) was docked into the lasso motif of the propeller form EM map by rigid-body fitting . The resulting model showed good agreement with the lasso density and required little additional manual adjustment in coot . EM density corresponding to bulky sidechains in this region allowed us to confidently establish the amino-acid register of the lasso-motif . Regions with less defined densities were built as polyalanine models . Automated real-space refinement , manual re-building and cross-validation were performed as described above for the quatrefoil form structure . The quality of the final propeller form model was evaluated by MolProbity and EMRinger ( Table 1 ) . Structure figures were generated using UCSF ChimeraX ( Goddard et al . , 2018 ) , PYMOL and HOLLOW ( Ho and Gruswitz , 2008 ) ."}

But how do bacteria , yeast and other single-celled microbes communicate ? In 2014 , researchers reported a new example of communication between bacteria and yeast in which the bacteria send a chemical message that has a very long-lasting effect on how the yeast grow in certain environments . This in turn also affected the ability of the bacteria to survive in these environments . The identity of the chemical message produced by the bacteria , however , was not known . Garcia , Dietrich et al . – including one of the researchers from the previous study – used biochemical and genetic approaches to identify the chemical message . The experiments show that the message is a molecule called lactic acid , which is very common in nature and is produced by many bacteria . Garcia , Dietrich et al . found out how much lactic acid is needed to alter the growth of brewer’s yeast , and which genes in yeast are involved in responding to the message from the bacteria . Further experiments suggest that the ability of yeast and bacteria to communicate using lactic acid is likely to have existed for hundreds of millions of years . The next step following this work will be to identify other chemical messages used by microbes . The human body is packed with billions of bacterial cells , and in some cases yeast can also take up residence . A future challenge will be to find out if bacteria and yeast inside the human body are able to communicate with each other in ways that could affect our health .", "article": "1 Introduction Small molecules commonly drive productive and destructive relationships between species . The breadth of these molecular messages is vividly illustrated by examples ranging from bacterial control of fungal pathogenesis to programming of multi-cellular development ( Alegado et al . , 2012; Ehrhardt et al . , 1992; Hogan and Kolter , 2002; Hogan et al . , 2004 ) . Small molecule interactions between mammals and their associated gut microbiota may have important consequences for human health ( David et al . , 2014; Lozupone et al . , 2012 ) . Cross-kingdom interactions also have commercial relevance – for example those that occur between yeast and bacteria in the fermentation of alcoholic beverages ( Bisson et al . , 2007; Bokulich et al . , 2012; Boulton et al . , 1996 ) . Pasteur and others since have noted that lactic acid bacteria are a common contaminant in incomplete fermentations ( Boulton et al . , 1996; Pasteur , 1873 ) . Indeed , brewers and vintners have long appreciated that some bacteria have the power to both reduce the ethanol content and spoil the taste profile of fermented beverages . The budding yeast S . cerevisiae is a metabolic specialist: it strongly favors glucose as a carbon source even when other carbohydrates are present ( Johnston , 1999 ) . This is achieved through stringent regulation of enzymes involved in glycolysis and respiration at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels ( Johnston , 1999; Zampar et al . , 2013 ) . Such glucose-associated repression of metabolism is a defining feature of S . cerevisiae , and many other microorganisms ( Gorke and Stulke , 2008 ) . A similar preference for glycolytic metabolism , even in the presence of oxygen , is a defining feature of cancer cells , known as the ‘Warburg effect’ ( Hsu and Sabatini , 2008; Liberti and Locasale , 2016; Vander Heiden et al . , 2009; Warburg , 1956 ) . When yeast cultures switch from metabolizing glucose to utilizing a respirative carbon source such as glycerol , they experience a pronounced lag phase known as the diauxic shift . This pause in growth occurs as a new transcriptional program is engaged to favor respiration ( Galdieri et al . , 2010; Zampar et al . , 2013 ) . The robust nature of this glucose-associated repression can be readily observed by using glucose mimetics . Even in trace quantities , these molecules provide a stable glucose signal , but cannot be metabolized . For example , just 0 . 05% of the mimetic glucosamine prevents yeast cells from utilizing non-fermentable carbon sources present at 40-fold higher concentrations ( Ball et al . , 1976; Brown and Lindquist , 2009; Kunz and Ball , 1977 ) . We recently reported that yeast strains have the ability to overcome such glucose-associated repression of metabolism at frequencies that depend upon the ecological niche from which they were isolated ( Jarosz et al . , 2014a , 2014b ) . This allows them to switch from being metabolic specialists to metabolic generalists , gaining the ability to metabolize a wide variety of carbon sources in the presence of glucose . This heritable change in metabolic program is not accompanied by a change in the yeast genotype . Rather , the trait is cytoplasmically transduced from mother cells to their daughters through the inheritance of an altered protein conformation – a prion known as [GAR+] ( named for its ability to reverse glucose associated repression ) ( Brown and Lindquist , 2009 ) . Although the molecular details of [GAR+] are incompletely understood , several operational tests to identify and modify it are known . [GAR+]’s nomenclature derives from defining characteristics of prion biology: dominance in genetic crosses ( denoted by capital letters ) and transmission to all progeny of meiosis ( denoted by brackets ) . The ability to acquire [GAR+] has been widely conserved among wild S . cerevisiae strains and is also present in fungal species separated by at least two hundred million years of evolution ( Jarosz et al . , 2014b ) . Under monoculture conditions in the laboratory , acquisition of [GAR+] occurs much more frequently than spontaneous mutations that reverse glucose repression ( Brown and Lindquist , 2009 ) . In nature , the precise rates of [GAR+] appearance correlate with environmental niche from which yeast are derived , suggestive of a bet-hedging mechanism for adaptation in environments with fluctuating carbon stores ( Griswold and Masel , 2009; Jarosz et al . , 2014b; Lancaster and Masel , 2009 ) . Perhaps most remarkably , [GAR+] can be induced by cross-kingdom communication with many bacterial species , and this interaction has been conserved over long evolutionary timescales ( Jarosz et al . , 2014a , 2014b ) . Notably , this relationship substantiates a model in which [GAR+]’s benefit as a reversible bet-hedging element would alone be sufficient to motivate its evolutionary retention ( Jarosz et al . , 2014b ) . Induction of [GAR+] by bacteria occurs with an extremely high efficiency – orders of magnitude greater than the spontaneous acquisition rate – and the consequences are mutually beneficial . [GAR+] yeast cells gain the ability to metabolize a wider range of carbohydrates , improved uptake of limiting nutrients , and increased chronological lifespan ( Jarosz et al . , 2014a ) . [GAR+] yeast cells also produce less ethanol , which itself has anti-bacterial properties . This generates a more hospitable environment for the inducing bacteria and allows them to flourish in fermentations where they would otherwise have perished ( Jarosz et al . , 2014a ) ; bacterial species that strongly induce [GAR+] are common contaminants in failed wine fermentations ( Bisson et al . , 2007; Boulton et al . , 1996; Jarosz et al . , 2014a ) . When yeast and inducing bacteria are co-cultured on solid medium , induction of [GAR+] occurs along a spatial gradient emanating from the bacteria . Conditioned medium generated from cultures of these bacteria also induces the prion ( Jarosz et al . , 2014a ) . These results and others have led us to propose that inducing bacteria produce a diffusible signal that promotes [GAR+] in yeast . Here we report that the common bacterial metabolite lactic acid can serve as this inducing signal . Different concentrations of lactic acid elicit distinct and heritable [GAR+]-like phenotypes that have the properties of ‘strong’ and ‘weak’ variants of the prion . Lactic acid also has the capacity to induce [GAR+]-like epigenetic states in evolutionarily distant organisms in which glucose repression has evolved independently . Our results suggest that [GAR+] induction may provide a molecular explanation for Pasteur’s observations , and indicate that links between lactate and diversification of metabolic strategies have been repeatedly employed to modulate the collective behavior of eukaryotic cells . More importantly , we for the first time uncover a bacterially secreted molecule that induces a prion . We do so using a straightforward approach with few technical prerequisites , which we propose could be used for discovering other natural molecules that potentiate epigenetic transformations . 2 Results Diverse bacteria have the capacity to induce [GAR+] in neighboring yeast cells through a cross-kingdom chemical communication . To characterize the diffusible element that was responsible for eliciting this change in yeast metabolism , we employed activity guided fractionation . We first grew large-volume cultures of the inducing bacteria S . gallinarum and L . innocua to saturation in rich media containing glycerol as a principle carbon source ( YP-glycerol ) . After removing the bacteria from the media by filtration to create a sterile conditioned medium , we assessed its capacity to induce growth on media containing glycerol ( 2% ) and glucosamine ( 0 . 05% ) , hereafter abbreviated as GLY + GlcN . GlcN provides a stable , non-metabolizable glucose signal ( Ball et al . , 1976; Kunz and Ball , 1977 ) . Serial dilutions of naïve [gar−] yeast did not grow on GLY + GlcN alone over a five day period , but pre-treatment with the conditioned medium caused the yeast cells to grow robustly . We then purified the extracts from each inducing bacterium using reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) on a C18 column . We collected fractions and monitored their ability to induce yeast cells to grow in GLY + GlcN . Pre-treatment with this purified extract afforded growth to a similar degree as S . gallinarum itself ( Figure 1A ) . After these two rounds of purification , the inducing activity eluted in a single fraction as a homogenous peak . We combined active fractions from multiple injections and analyzed this peak by NMR and mass spectrometry . Both analyses revealed that the active fraction contained high concentrations of lactic acid ( Figure 1B; Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 17978 . 003Figure 1 . Identification of the small molecule that induces [GAR+] in a concentration dependent manner . ( A ) S . gallinarum spotted next to yeast on GLY + GlcN ( YP with 2% glycerol and 0 . 05% glucosamine ) induced growth of naïve S . cerevisiae in a spatially dependent manner .

Each panel shows two biological replicates of yeast colonies spotted in five-fold serial dilutions from saturated cultures .

Growth rates of [GAR+] and [gar−] cells do not differ in the presence of lactic acid .

[GAR+] cells neither grew faster than [gar−] cells in glycerol alone nor when lactic acid was added .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 17978 . 006 Lactic acid , a small organic molecule , exists in two distinct forms: L- ( + ) -lactic acid ( L-LA ) and its mirror image D- ( – ) -lactic acid ( D-LA ) . Both occur naturally . Some bacteria , including the class known as lactic acid bacteria ( LAB ) , have the ability to produce one or both forms from carbohydrates ( Eiteman and Ramalingam , 2015; Salminen et al . , 2004 ) . Eukaryotes typically can metabolize both isomers , sometimes to varying degrees ( Adeva-Andany et al . , 2014; Pajot and Claisse , 1974 ) . Malolactic fermentation by LAB in winemaking can typically yield up to 2 . 5 g/L of lactic acid , or 0 . 25% ( Boulton et al . , 1996 ) ; in other fermented foods , concentrations can exceed 10 g/L , or >1% ( Fleming et al . , 1988; Plengvidhya et al . , 2007 ) . Moreover , many bacterial species that we previously found to strongly induce [GAR+] are known LAB ( Jarosz et al . , 2014a ) . To establish whether lactic acid was sufficient to induce heritable reversal of glucose repression in S . cerevisiae , we tested the ability of yeast to grow on GLY + GlcN agar plates supplemented with concentrations of L- or D-lactic acid at 0 . 025 or 0 . 625% . We saw robust reversal of glucose repression in this range from both stereoisomers , in a concentration dependent manner ( Figure 1C ) . D-lactic acid induced cells to acquire the phenotype slightly more rapidly ( data not shown ) . Addition of 0 . 05% lactic acid did not increase growth on YP alone , eliminating the possibility that the yeast were simply metabolizing the lactic acid ( data not shown ) . Induction was also robust in synthetic complete medium , further establishing that it was due to the added lactic acid , rather than unknown components of the medium ( e . g . yeast extract , peptone , or an unknown metabolite therein; Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ) . Finally , we addressed the possibility that the presence of lactic acid could select for pre-existing [GAR+] cells , as opposed to true induction of [gar−] cells into the [GAR+] state . We examined the growth rates of isogenic [GAR+] cells and [gar−] cells in liquid YP-glycerol ( GLY ) alone or in YP-glycerol supplemented with 0 . 35% lactic acid . We did not observe any significant prion-dependent differences in growth ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3 ) , supporting an induction mechanism rather than selection of a pre-existing population . Glucose repression can be commonly circumvented in S . cerevisiae by induction of the [GAR+] prion , but it can less frequently arise from genetic mutations ( Ball et al . , 1976; Kunz and Ball , 1977 ) and , in principle , from other heritable epigenetic modifications ( Jarosz et al . , 2014a , 2014b ) . We thus tested whether the reversal of glucose repression that we observed in response to lactic acid was due to [GAR+] . To do so we examined hallmarks of prion-based inheritance: dominance in genetic crosses and the ability to be heritably reduced or eliminated by perturbations in chaperone activity ( Shorter and Lindquist , 2005; Wickner et al . , 2004 ) . We first mated yeast cells that had been induced with 0 . 1% lactic acid to naïve isogenic mating partners and selected for diploids . All diploids we tested grew on GLY + GlcN medium , and moreover exhibited the same unusual pattern of semi-dominance ( Figure 2A ) – in which the diploid cells exhibit a strength of reversal of glucose repression that is intermediate between the two haploid parents – that is highly characteristic of both spontaneous and bacterially-induced [GAR+] ( Brown and Lindquist , 2009; Jarosz et al . , 2014a ) . We next sporulated diploid cells induced with lactic acid , dissected multiple tetrads , and examined the ability of the resulting spores to grow on GLY + GlcN . Nearly all spores we tested ( 29 of 31 ) exhibited the [GAR+] phenotype , in agreement with the non-Mendelian , dominant inheritance previously noted for both spontaneous and bacterially induced [GAR+] cells ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 17978 . 007Figure 2 . Lactic acid induced [GAR+] has the same prion-like features as spontaneous [GAR+] . ( A ) Dominance in crosses between [GAR+] strains and [gar−] strains is seen in colonies isolated from a GLY + GlcN plate ( spontaneous [GAR+] ) , as well as those induced with 0 . 1% D-lactic acid ( LA-induced [GAR+] ) . Five-fold serial dilutions are shown for three biological replicates; orange coloring indicates strains exhibiting the [GAR+] phenotype . ( B ) Lactic acid-induced cells can be cured of the [GAR+] phenotype with transient expression of a dominant negative Hsp70 variant ( Ssa1-K69M or Hsp70DN ) . Single colonies were propagated alone or with a plasmid expressing Hsp70DN for ~125 generations , bottlenecked each ~25 generations . After verifying plasmid loss , colonies were again tested for their capacity to grow on GLY + GlcN medium . Each image shows five-fold serial dilutions for three biological replicates . ( C ) A strain with diminished expression of PMA1 , pma1-DAmP , has reduced spontaneous [GAR+] acquisition and is not induced by lactic acid . Lactic acid-induction frequencies differ from those in Figure 1C due to strain background BY4741 , which has a lower frequency of [GAR+] acquisition ( Brown and Lindquist , 2009 ) . Plotted as in Figure 1C . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 17978 . 00710 . 7554/eLife . 17978 . 008Figure 2—figure supplement 1 . Both spontaneous and lactic acid-induced [GAR+] diploids transmit the phenotype through meiosis to nearly all spores , demonstrating non-Mendelian inheritance .

Both spontaneous [GAR+] cells and lactic acid-induced [GAR+] S . cerevisiae cells exhibited sensitivity to the Hsp70 inhibitor myricetin ( 50 μM ) on GLY + GlcN medium . Each image shows five-fold serial dilutions for two representative biological replicates . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 17978 . 009 [GAR+] is unusual among known prions in that it is not influenced by perturbation of the Hsp104 disaggregase ( Brown and Lindquist , 2009; Jarosz et al . , 2014a ) . Instead it is sensitive to perturbation of Hsp70 function ( Brown and Lindquist , 2009; Jarosz et al . , 2014a , 2014b ) . We assembled multiple colonies that had been induced with lactic acid to grow on GLY + GlcN plates . We then transformed them with a plasmid that constitutively expressed a dominant negative Hsp70 variant ( Ssa1-K69M , or Hsp70DN ) . We passaged these cells five times on media that selected for the plasmid . We then passaged them three times on non-selective plates ( and confirmed plasmid loss ) before retesting them on GLY + GlcN plates . This regimen cured multiple independent clones of their induced [GAR+] phenotype , indicating that the lactic acid induced colonies have the same Hsp70-dependency as spontaneous and bacterially induced [GAR+] cells ( Figure 2B ) . We also grew induced cells on plates containing an Hsp70 inhibitor , myricetin ( Chang et al . , 2011; Koren et al . , 2010 ) , at concentrations that did not affect growth on GLY medium . This regimen , which has been shown to inhibit the growth of both spontaneous and bacterially induced [GAR+] on GLY + GlcN ( Jarosz et al . , 2014b ) , also reduced the ability of these colonies to circumvent glucose repression that had been induced by lactic acid ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2 ) . We next tested whether our lactic acid induced isolates exhibited genetic characteristics related to proteins originally linked to spontaneous [GAR+] . PMA1 encodes the essential major plasma membrane proton pump in yeast; in [GAR+] cells Pma1 adopts an altered conformation and associates more strongly with another protein , Std1 ( Brown and Lindquist , 2009 ) . Because PMA1 is essential , we employed pma1-DAmP , a degron allele that reduces the amount of protein expressed ( Breslow et al . , 2008 ) . Cells harboring this allele had a low frequency of spontaneous prion acquisition , and could not be induced to acquire [GAR+] by exposure to lactic acid ( Figure 2C ) . Thus , the heritable bypass of glucose repression induced by lactic acid has the same prion-like patterns of inheritance and depends upon the same proteins as spontaneous and bacterially induced [GAR+] . Although this lactic acid-induced epigenetic state could in principle differ from the spontaneous prion in other unknown ways , for simplicity we hereafter refer to it as [GAR+] . Lactic acid can be imported into yeast via saturable ( “active”' ) and unsaturable ( 'passive' ) mechanisms ( Casal et al . , 1999; Pacheco et al . , 2012; Paiva et al . , 2013 ) . Both depend upon the transcription factor SOK2 , and the active mechanism is ultimately mediated by the monocarboxylate transporter JEN1 . Jen1 is required for yeast to grow on lactic acid as a sole carbon source , but is down-regulated during glucose repression ( Casal et al . , 1999; Pacheco et al . , 2012 ) , and its transcript was not abundant in [GAR+] cells compared to control cells ( Brown and Lindquist , 2009; Jarosz et al . , 2014a ) . Deletion of JEN1 greatly reduces growth on glycerol compared to wild-type cells , precluding its emergence in the previous screens for genes affecting [GAR+] ( Brown and Lindquist , 2009; Jarosz et al . , 2014a ) . We therefore tested if lactic acid could induce jen1∆ cells to acquire [GAR+] . Deletion of JEN1 did not influence [GAR+] induction by lactic acid at either low or high concentrations ( Figure 3A , B ) , indicating that active transport is not required . We also tested whether enzymes reported to be involved in lactic acid metabolism in the Saccharomyces Genome Database ( Cherry et al . , 2012 ) could influence the ability of this molecule to induce [GAR+] . Individual deletion of these various lactic acid dehydrogenases and transhydrogenases ( DLD1 , DLD2 , DLD3 , and CYB2 ) also had no significant effect on [GAR+] induction by lactic acid ( Figure 3A , B ) . Thus , the cellular mechanisms engaged by lactic acid to induce [GAR+] do not require its active import or its metabolism . 10 . 7554/eLife . 17978 . 010Figure 3 .

( A ) Plating assay ( see Materials and methods ) measuring induction of [GAR+] at a low ( left ) or high concentration ( right ) of L-lactic acid . Strains are in the W303 background , and cell dilutions match those in Figure 1C . We note that annotations of DLD2 and DLD3 as D-lactate dehydrogenases have recently been challenged by data suggesting they are instead transhydrogenases ( Becker-Kettern et al . , 2016 ) . Only DLD1 is required for yeast to grow on D-lactic acid as a sole carbon source . Plotted the same as in Figure 1C . B . ) Plating assay measuring induction of [GAR+] by D-lactic acid . Otherwise as in ( A ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 17978 . 010 SOK2 previously emerged as a hit in the screen for yeast mutants that were impaired in their ability to acquire [GAR+] upon induction by the bacterium Staphylococcus hominis ( Jarosz et al . , 2014a ) . We replicated this result using S . gallinarum in a co-plating assay on GLY + GlcN ( Figure 4A ) . We then tested whether loss of SOK2 impaired the capacity of lactic acid alone to induce [GAR+] in yeast cells . It did: yeast cells in which SOK2 was deleted were not induced by lactic acid ( Figure 4B ) . Thus , the previously described passive import of lactic acid ( Paiva et al . , 2013 ) is likely the dominant means through which this inducing signal is transmitted from bacteria to neighboring fungi . 10 . 7554/eLife . 17978 . 011Figure 4 . Full induction by S . gallinarum or lactic acid requires the yeast transcription factor SOK2 .

( B ) Plating assay ( see Materials and methods ) comparing spontaneous and lactic acid-induced [GAR+] frequency in wild type and sok2∆ cells . Lactic acid-induction frequencies differ from those in Figure 1C due to strain background BY4741 , which has a lower frequency of [GAR+] acquisition ( Brown and Lindquist , 2009 ) . Plotted the same as in Figure 1C . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 17978 . 011 Since environmental conditions can exert a strong influence on the amount of lactic acid produced by bacteria , we next tested differing amounts of lactic acid , over a larger concentration regime . Even the lowest concentration we tested in this experiment , 0 . 015% , increased the number of colonies that arose on a GLY + GlcN plate by nearly three orders of magnitude , such that approximately 5% of cells grew into medium-sized colonies ( Figure 5A ) . Increasing concentrations of lactic acid up to 0 . 25% did not strongly increase the degree of induction . However , 1% lactic acid caused an even stronger induction , such that nearly all cells in the population grew into large colonies on GLY + GlcN media ( Figure 5A ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 17978 . 012Figure 5 . The strength of the [GAR+] phenotype depends on the concentration of lactic acid used for induction . ( A ) Plating assay ( see Materials and methods ) showing that L-lactic acid strongly induced [GAR+] over a wide concentration range . Plotted the same as in Figure 1C . Ten-fold dilutions were used for plates lacking lactic acid and 10 , 000-fold dilutions were used for plates containing lactic acid ( B ) Single [GAR+] colonies were picked from two representative concentrations in ( A ) , propagated ( restreaked ) on non-selective medium ( GLY ) for approximately 75 generations , and then re-spotted on GLY + GlcN in five-fold serial dilutions . Four biological replicates are shown for each induced group , and two for uninduced cells . Note the growth in the third spots ( highest dilution ) of 0 . 0625% L-LA induced cells on GLY + GlcN . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 17978 . 012 Like virtually all prions , [GAR+] can exist in multiple ‘strains’ – different heritable and stable activity states . When they arise spontaneously on selective GLY + GlcN plates , ‘strong’ [GAR+] colonies are larger than ‘weak’ [GAR+] colonies ( Brown and Lindquist , 2009; Jarosz et al . , 2014a ) . Both activity states are heritable over long biological timescales ( Brown and Lindquist , 2009; Jarosz et al . , 2014a ) . We picked small-sized colonies that had been induced with low concentrations of lactic acid , and large colonies that had been induced with higher concentrations of lactic acid and propagated them for ~75 generations on non-selective rich medium ( YPD ) . We then returned them to GLY + GlcN plates . The small colonies that had originally been induced with low concentrations of lactic acid grew modestly on GLY + GlcN , in a manner that mimicked ‘weak’ [GAR+] strains ( Figure 5B ) . The large colonies that had originally been induced with high concentrations of lactic acid grew robustly on GLY + GlcN , in a manner that mimicked ‘strong’ [GAR+] strains ( Figure 5B ) . Thus , alterations in the concentration of lactic acid produced by inducing bacteria may engage different heritable activity states , or so-called ‘strains’ , of the [GAR+] prion . Glucose repression has evolved multiple times in the fungal lineage ( Hagman and Piskur , 2015 ) . Dekkera bruxellensis , an organism used in the production of lambic beers that diverged from S . cerevisiae 200 million years ago , uses a distinct mechanism for engaging stringent glucose repression ( Rozpedowska et al . , 2011; Woolfit et al . , 2007 ) . We previously established that despite this evolutionary distance , D . bruxellensis can spontaneously acquire a [GAR+]-like state to become a metabolic generalist ( Jarosz et al . , 2014b ) . This [GAR+]-like state can also be induced by cross-kingdom chemical communication with bacteria . Although the molecular lexicon of cross-kingdom communication can evolve extraordinarily rapidly , the simplicity and ubiquity of lactic acid led us to investigate whether it might also influence heritable reversal of stringent glucose repression in D . bruxellensis . We exposed naïve D . bruxellensis strains to lactic acid , guided by our results from S . cerevisiae . Concentrations well within the physiological range of lactic acid produced by bacteria ( 0 . 02% ) induced robust growth on GLY + GlcN ( Figure 6A ) . We picked colonies from these selections and propagated them for ~75 generations on non-selective rich medium ( YPD ) . In each case , the trait was heritable: induced colonies maintained the ability to circumvent glucose repression ( Figure 6B ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 17978 . 013Figure 6 . Induction , maintenance , and chaperone dependence of a lactic acid-induced [GAR+]-like state is conserved in the evolutionary distant yeast Dekkera bruxellensis . ( A ) Induction of a [GAR+]-like state in D . bruxellensis . [gar−] cells were plated on GLY + GlcN ( containing 0 . 1–0 . 15% glucosamine ) medium with or without 0 . 02% D-lactic acid . Control cells harbor spontaneous [GAR+] . For each of the treatment images , four biological replicates are shown , in five-fold serial dilutions . ( B ) Maintenance and chaperone dependence of the lactic acid-induced [GAR+]-like state in D . bruxellensis . Cells induced in A . were propagated non-selectively for ~75 generations by restreaking on YPD plates , then subsequently retested for maintenance of the prion phenotype on GLY + GlcN ( 0 . 1–0 . 15% glucosamine ) , with or without the Hsp70 inhibitor myricetin ( 50 μM ) . Four biological replicates are shown for each induced group , and two shown for the uninduced and propagated [gar−] cells . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 17978 . 013 The [GAR+]-like states that arise spontaneously or are induced by bacteria in D . bruxellensis depend strongly on the activity of Hsp70 chaperones ( Jarosz et al . , 2014b ) . We therefore tested whether the D . bruxellensis colonies induced by lactic acid to circumvent glucose repression were sensitive to Hsp70 inhibition . We plated serial dilutions of D . bruxellensis cells that had been induced with lactic acid on GLY + GlcN plates and on GLY + GlcN plates containing the Hsp70 inhibitor myricetin ( Chang et al . , 2011; Koren et al . , 2010 ) . We used a concentration of this inhibitor that did not significantly affect growth on GLY alone . This treatment significantly reduced the ability of these induced colonies to circumvent glucose repression ( Figure 6B ) , just as it does for the [GAR+]-like states that arise spontaneously in this organism ( Jarosz et al . , 2014b ) . Thus , across a vast evolutionary distance , bacterial production of lactic acid can engage [GAR+]-like mechanisms to heritably convert neighboring fungi from metabolic specialists to metabolic generalists . 3 Discussion More than a century ago , Louis Pasteur documented what vintners have long since appreciated: the presence of lactic acid producing bacteria in fermentations can often lead to their failure ( Pasteur , 1873 ) . Our observations suggest that the ability of lactic acid to elicit the [GAR+] prion could provide a molecular mechanism for those observations . The [GAR+] prion is found in evolutionarily distant fungal species , and can confer strong selective advantage – converting metabolic specialists to metabolic generalists in a manner that improves fitness in complex microbial communities ( Jarosz et al . , 2014a , 2014b ) . Our data link the common bacterial metabolite lactic acid , both structurally simple and widespread in nature , to this ancient switch in metabolic strategies . Recent evidence points to important signaling roles for lactic acid in human cancer cells , in the context of the Warburg effect ( Adeva-Andany et al . , 2014; Dhup et al . , 2012; Fiaschi et al . , 2012; Liberti and Locasale , 2016 ) . Other studies have linked LAB to benefits for human health and disease prevention , however it remains unclear how much these effects are due to the effects of lactic acid on host cells ( Kim et al . , 2007; Masood et al . , 2011; Tiptiri-Kourpeti et al . , 2016 ) . In at least some cases , LAB appear to exert their health effects by influencing other microbes , for example , modulating the virulence of Clostridium difficile ( Lee et al . , 2013; Yun et al . , 2014 ) . Many mysteries remain regarding the genetic and biochemical features that lead to the [GAR+] prion; findings have so far been limited to its initial characterization ( Brown and Lindquist , 2009 ) and discovery of its regulation by environmental cues ( Jarosz et al . , 2014a ) . Our discovery of a connection between passive lactic acid uptake and the ability to induce [GAR+] ( via our results with SOK2 ) provides new insight into the initiation of this complex cross-kingdom chemical communication . Further molecular understanding of induction by lactic acid , and its links to the unusual biochemistry that fuels [GAR+] , stands as a goal for future studies . Several lines of evidence suggest that other molecules may modulate [GAR+] induction by lactic acid . Although we were able to fully reconstitute induction with lactic acid alone , the kinetics were slightly faster in conditioned media . Moreover , some of the bacteria that induce [GAR+] in S . cerevisiae do not induce the [GAR+]-like state in D . bruxellensis , even though high levels of lactic acid can induce the prion in each of these organisms . An intriguing but plausible explanation is that other bacterially secreted factors influence perception of the lactic acid signal , and that the effects of these molecules may also be species specific . Indeed , there is precedent for this behavior in choanoflagellates , where two bacterially secreted lipids were required to recapitulate full induction of rosette , multicellular colony formation ( Alegado et al . , 2012; Woznica et al . , 2016 ) . Finally , although we have shown that S . gallinarium induces [GAR+] via lactic acid , it is entirely possible that other molecules could also fuel this cross-kingdom interaction in diverse ecological niches . There is also precedent in mechanisms of quorum sensing for competition among inducers secreted by different bacteria ( Drescher et al . , 2014; Even-Tov et al . , 2016 ) . Perhaps most remarkably , our study raises the possibility that other prion-like epigenetic states could be regulated by common metabolites , at times in service of cross-species communication . Prior studies have highlighted the fact that general stressors that perturb protein homeostasis can modestly elevate the frequency of cells harboring the [PSI+] or [MOT3+] prions ( Holmes et al . , 2013; Tyedmers et al . , 2008 ) . These intrinsic links between stress responses and prion switching ensure that subpopulations of cells can diversify their phenotypes when they are ill-suited to the environment . Our findings extend this biology to a more concerted , switch-like behavior in which prions can serve as a target for rapid and effective cross-species communication . Biological niches like the human body harbor microbial communities that are far more complex than those we have studied here ( Lozupone et al . , 2012 ) . It is striking that the robust connection we have discovered between a simple metabolite and a heritable change in metabolic strategy has been missed despite a multitude studies in this model organism . Our observations thus underscore the potential of cross-kingdom molecular communication to illuminate biological processes , in particular its capacity to elicit heritable , epigenetic transformations of biological traits . Recent progress in metabolomics and metagenomics motivate deeper exploration of such interactions between species , at both the molecular and systems levels . 4 Materials and methods Bacteria strains were cultured on LB agar ( Research Products International , Mt . Prospect , IL and BD-Difco , Franklin Lakes , NJ ) plates . Yeast strains were cultured on either: ( 1 ) YPD agar or liquid ( RPI and BD-Difco ) , ( 2 ) YP-Glycerol agar ( 1% Yeast Extract ( BD Bacto ) , 2% Peptone ( BD BBL/Difco ) , 2% glycerol ( Sigma-Aldrich , St . Louis , MO and Amresco , Solon , OH ) , 2% agar ( IBI Scientific , Peosta , IA] ) , or ( 3 ) “'GLY + GlcN”' agar ( same mixture as YP-Glycerol ) which is supplemented with 0 . 05% glucosamine hydrochloride ( Sigma-Aldrich ) ( 0 . 1–0 . 15% for D . bruxellensis ) that was added from a filter-sterilized 5% stock once media cooled to ~60°C after autoclaving . We noticed that the stringency of selection for [GAR+] cells on GLY + GlcN media was dependent on the source of yeast extract and peptone , and therefore recommend the aforementioned suppliers , as other sources for unknown reasons sometimes imposed much weaker selection . Myricetin ( Sigma-Aldrich ) was made into a stock solution of 15 . 7 mM in 100% ethanol , and then diluted to a final concentration of 50 μM in agar medium once cooled to ~60°C after autoclaving . Strains were maintained using standard microbiological techniques . Bacteria and S . cerevisiae strains were grown up in 2–5 mL cultures at 30°C shaking or rotating overnight for most experiments; for experiments requiring smaller volumes they were grown in 200 μL volumes in microtiter plates . All D . bruxellensis strains were grown at room temperature until saturation for liquid or sufficiently large colonies for agar plates , typically requiring at least 5 days of growth . Serial dilutions , starting from saturated cultures , were performed in 96-well plates using multichannel pipettes , and cells were spotted gently onto agar plates using a blot replicating tool ( V&P Scientific VP404A , San Diego , CA ) . For S . cerevisiae strains , GLY plates were grown for 2 days before imaging . GLY + GlcN plates were grown 5–7 days before imaging . D . bruxellensis strains required several extra days of growth for single colonies to become visible . Bacterial strains that induced yeast growth on GLY + GlcN media were grown in large scale to purify the active component . Strains were grown from single colonies in 5 mL LB cultures overnight at 30°C and with 250 rpm shaking . The inoculum was then transferred to Erlenmeyer flasks containing 200 mL YP-Glycerol and incubated for 72 hr at 250 rpm , 30°C . The media were centrifuged ( 30 min at 6000 rpm , Beckman ( Brea , CA ) JLA 8 . 1 rotor ) , and passed through a 0 . 22 μm filter . The filter-sterilized media was acidified to pH ~1 using 2M HCl , and extracted with a threefold volumetric excess of ethyl acetate . The organic extracts were dried over sodium sulfate , concentrated on a rotary evaporator , suspended in 2–4 mL water , and neutralized with sodium hydroxide . The extract was purified by preparative HPLC using a gradient of acetonitrile ( solvent B , Fisher Scientific ( Waltham , MA ) , containing 0 . 1% formic acid ) in milli-Q water ( solvent A , containing 0 . 1% formic acid ) on a reversed-phase C18 column ( Phenomenex ( Torrance , CA ) Luna 5U , 100A , 250 × 21 . 29 mm ) . The following program was used: 10 mL/min; ramp from 0 to 20 min of 2% to 35% B , followed by a 10 min wash cycle; collect 0 . 5 min fractions from 7 to 13 min . Collected fractions were dried in a speed-vac , suspended in water ( ~5 mL ) and passed through a 0 . 22 μm filter . Active fractions were identified by assaying their ability to induce growth of YDJ1034 in typically non-permissive GLY + GlcN media containing crude bacterial extracts or HPLC fractions ( 10 to 25% of total media volume ) . Fractions that supported yeast growth in GLY + GlcN were combined and subjected to subsequent rounds of semi-preparative HPLC using a gradient of acetonitrile ( containing 0 . 1% formic acid – solvent B ) in water ( containing 0 . 1% formic acid – solvent A ) on a reversed-phase C18 column ( Phenomenex Luna 5U , 100A , 250 x 10 . 00 mm ) . The following program was used: 2 . 4 mL/min; ramp from 0 to 20 min of 2% to 10% B , followed by a 15 min wash cycle; collect 0 . 2 min fractions from 8 . 4 to 9 . 4 min . Fractions were analyzed by high-resolution HPLC-MRM-mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy . The active fractions contained high levels of lactic acid , which was confirmed by NMR and by co-injection with a purified standard ( Figure 1B ) . Multiple sources of lactic acid yielded similar results . We tested sodium D-lactate ( Sigma-Aldrich 71716 ) , sodium L-lactate ( Sigma-Aldrich L7022 ) , D-lactic acid zinc salt ( MP Biomedicals , Santa Ana , CA ) , and L- ( + ) -lactic acid ( Sigma-Aldrich L6402 ) . Excess NaCl was tested in control reactions to mimic the sodium chloride produced during naturalization of sodium lactate and found to produce no phenotypic differences . Lactic acid was added to GLY + GlcN medium at indicated concentrations before autoclaving , and pH was balanced if necessary to ensure it was within ~0 . 1 units or less of control media lacking lactic acid ( pH ~6 . 8 ) . For the plating assay , S . cerevisiae W303 strains were plated with 100 μL volumes for all plates . For BY4741 strains , 250 μL volumes were plated for GLY + GlcN plates +/– lactic acid ( no cell dilution ) , while 100 μL was used for GLY plates . Cell dilution was empirically determined to obtain plates containing between approximately 25 and 300 colonies per plate , which were counted using an aCOLyte colony counter ( Synbiosis , Cambridge , England ) . For all GLY plates , a 100 , 000-fold dilution of saturated culture was plated . For GLY + GlcN plates for W303 strains , a 10-fold dilution of saturated culture was plated; for GLY + GlcN plates containing lactic acid , dilutions of 1000-fold or 10 , 000-fold were plated to achieve a suitable colony number for W303 strains . Induction frequency was calculated by normalizing the number of colony forming units ( CFUs ) on the GLY + GlcN plates to the total possible number on GLY plates after accounting for cell dilutions , reported as [GAR+] cfu/total cfu . We noted some variability in values of [GAR+] cfu/total cfu from experiment to experiment ( e . g . for spontaneous rate between Figure 1C and Figure 5A ) , however the qualitative relationship between lactic acid concentration and increased [GAR+] cfu/total cfu was maintained across all dilutions tested . For induction of D . bruxellensis strains , cells were spotted in serial dilutions on plates containing lactic acid . Single colonies were picked from the highest dilution and propagated as described in figure legends . Diploids were constructed by crossing indicated BY4741 haploids to the BY4742 parental strain ( ATCC , Manassas , VA ) by mixing a bead of cells of each strain together on a YPD plate and growing overnight . A small globule of this cell mixture was then restreaked to single colonies on SD-Lys-Met agar plates to select for diploids . Deletion mutants in the W303 background were created by amplifying a KanMX construct from corresponding gene deletion mutants from the BY4741 library , using primers listed in Supplementary file 1C . Approximately 500 ng of purified construct was transformed into YDJ1034 , and integrants were selected on agar plates containing G418 ( Fisher Scientific ) . All gene deletions were confirmed by PCR using primers listed in Supplementary file 1C . Curing of the [GAR+] phenotype ( Figure 2B ) was achieved by transformation of lactic acid induced cells with PDJ281 ( Hygromycin resistant , Supplementary file 1D ) , restreaking multiple transformants to single colonies on YPD plates containing 400 ug/mL hygromycin ( Gold Biotechnology , Olivette , MO ) a total of five times , then restreaking in the same manner on YPD plates twice before confirming each clone had lost the plasmid by testing on YPD+hygromycin . These clones were grown in liquid YPD cultures before testing on GLY + GlcN media . Spontaneous and lactic acid-induced [GAR+] diploids ( W303 background , Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) were isolated from single colonies grown on GLY + GlcN or GLY + GlcN + lactic acid plates and grown in Pre-SPO liquid media ( YPD with 6% glucose ) for 3 days at room temperature . Cells were then pelleted and washed twice in SPO media ( 1% Potassium Acetate ( Sigma-Aldrich ) , 320 mg CSM-Met powder ( Sunrise Science , San Diego , CA ) , 20 mg Methionine ( Sigma-Aldrich ) per liter ) , and then diluted ten-fold to obtain 3 mL cultures in SPO media . These cultures were incubated on a rotary wheel for one week at room temperature , before dissecting tetrads on a Singer Instruments MSM400 ( Somerset , UK ) . Recovered spores were grown to saturation in liquid YPD before testing on GLY + GlcN media . Yeast plates were imaged using an Epson Perfection V700 Photo Scanner ( Long Beach , CA ) . Plots were made using PRISM 6 software ( GraphPad , La Jolla , CA ) ."}
{"doi": "elife-28590-v2", "abstract": "Sonic hedgehog ( Shh ) expression in the limb bud organizing centre called the zone of polarizing activity is regulated by the ZRS enhancer . Here , we examine in mouse and in a mouse limb-derived cell line the dynamic events that activate and restrict the spatial activity of the ZRS . Fibroblast growth factor ( FGF ) signalling in the distal limb primes the ZRS at early embryonic stages maintaining a poised , but inactive state broadly across the distal limb mesenchyme . The E26 transformation-specific transcription factor , ETV4 , which is induced by FGF signalling and acts as a repressor of ZRS activity , interacts with the histone deacetylase HDAC2 and ensures that the poised ZRS remains transcriptionally inactive . Conversely , GABPα , an activator of the ZRS , recruits p300 , which is associated with histone acetylation ( H3K27ac ) indicative of an active enhancer . Hence , the primed but inactive state of the ZRS is induced by FGF signalling and in combination with balanced histone modification events establishes the restricted , active enhancer responsible for patterning the limb bud during development .", "plain language summary": "As an animal embryo develops , specific genes need to be switched on and off at the right time and place to ensure that the embryo’s tissues and organs form properly . Proteins called transcription factors control the activity of individual genes by binding to regions of DNA known as enhancers . Changes in the way DNA is packaged inside cells can affect the ability of transcription factors to access the enhancers , and therefore also influence when particular genes are switched on or off . Sonic hedgehog ( or Shh for short ) is a gene that helps to control various aspects of development including the formation of the limbs and brain . The limb forms from a structure in the embryo referred to as the limb bud . An enhancer called ZRS regulates the precise position within the limb bud where the Shh gene is active in a region designated as the “zone of polarizing activity” . Yet , it was not known how the enhancer is controlled to ensure this pattern is achieved . Peluso et al . investigated the events that lead to ZRS becoming active in mice embryos . The experiments show that the ZRS enhancer exists in three different states in cells across the limb bud: poised , active and inactive . The enhancer is poised in a broad region of the limb bud in cells that are potentially able to switch on the Shh gene . Proteins called fibroblast growth factors drive the enhancer to enter this poised state by altering the way the DNA containing the enhancer is packaged in the cell . Specific transcription factors are able to bind to the poised enhancer and it is the balance between these different transcription factors that activates the enhancer in the zone of polarizing activity . Furthermore in the region of the limb bud where the fibroblast growth factors are not present the ZRS is inactive . These findings show that fibroblast growth factors , in combination with other changes to the ZRS enhancer , restrict the area in which the enhancer is active to a particular region of the limb bud . Differences in enhancer elements are known to underlie a range of inherited characteristics and may influence whether an individual develops many common diseases . In the future , investigating how cells control the activity of enhancers may provide clues to identifying new targets for drugs to treat some of these diseases .", "article": "1 Introduction Spatial specific gene expression is fundamental to controlling cell identity in embryonic tissue . Early in the mesenchyme of the developing mammalian limb bud there are no observable morphological differences or histological boundaries; nevertheless , the limb bud is initially polarized along the anterior-posterior axis ( Tickle , 2015 ) establishing a specialized compartment of cells at the posterior margin called the zone of polarizing activity ( ZPA ) . The function of the ZPA is the expression of Shh , which operates as a morphogen and a mitogen to coordinate digit formation by integrating growth with digit specification during limb development ( Towers et al . , 2008; Zhu et al . , 2008 ) . A highly conserved ~780 bp enhancer called the ZRS controls the spatiotemporal expression of the Shh gene in the ZPA of both the fore and hind limbs ( Lettice et al . , 2002; 2003; Sagai et al . , 2005 ) . The ZRS lies in an intron of the ubiquitously expressed Lmbr1 gene at a distance of 1 Mb from the Shh gene in human . Well over 20 different point mutations occurring in the ZRS are associated with the misregulation of Shh and consequently , to limb skeletal defects . These include preaxial polydactyly type 2 ( PPD2 ) , triphalangeal thumb polysyndactyly , syndactyly type IV , and Werner’s mesomelic syndrome , collectively referred to as ZRS-associated syndromes ( Lettice et al . , 2003 , Lettice et al . , 2008; Farooq et al . , 2010; Furniss et al . , 2008; Gurnett et al . , 2007; Semerci et al . , 2009; Wieczorek et al . , 2010 ) . The regulatory mechanisms that direct gene expression to embryonic compartments are not well established in mammalian development; therefore , to understand the events that occur , it is crucial to investigate the activation of spatiotemporal specific enhancers during this process . We previously showed that members of the E26 transformation-specific ( ETS ) transcription factor family ( Sharrocks , 2001 ) are involved in the spatial pattern of Shh expression ( Lettice et al . , 2012 ) . Occupancy at multiple ETS sites , which bind the factors GABPα and ETS1 , regulates the position of the Shh expression boundary in the limb , thus defining the ZPA . In contrast , binding sites for ETV4 and ETV5 in the ZRS , when occupied , repress ectopic Shh expression outside the ZPA . A single base pair change is able to subvert this normal developmental process to give rise to skeletal abnormalities . For example , two different human PPD2 point mutations generate additional ETS binding sites , thereby , de-repressing expression of Shh in the anterior limb bud . The balance between binding of the activators and repressors is crucial for normal Shh expression and the mutations that disrupt this balance result in skeletal defects . Analysis of developmental gene regulation must also take into account the mechanisms of long-range enhancer/promoter interactions . Previously , we showed that the ZRS contains two domains with distinct activities; one domain , the 5’ end of the ZRS ( 472 bp ) , directs the spatiotemporal activity and the second domain , the 3’ half ( 308 bp ) , is required to mediate activity over long genomic distances ( Lettice et al . , 2014 ) . Additionally higher-order chromatin conformational changes that occur in the Shh locus play a role in gene expression . Elevated frequencies of Shh/ZRS co-localization were observed only in the Shh expressing regions of the limb bud ( Amano et al . , 2009 ) , in a conformation consistent with enhancer-promoter loop formation ( Williamson et al . , 2016 ) . However , the domain between Shh and ZRS is highly compacted in all tissues and developmental stages analysed independent of Shh expression . Here , we investigate the stepwise events that mediate the spatiotemporal activation of an enhancer during development . We demonstrate that even though the activity of the ZRS is restricted to the ZPA , it retains features of a poised enhancer along the full distal portion of the limb bud composed of the mesenchymal cells of the progress zone; whereas , H3K27ac is enriched just in the distal-posterior limb region . We show that fibroblast growth factor ( FGF ) signalling plays a key role in priming the ZRS as indicated by an increase in H3K4me1 at the enhancer . In addition , we show the mechanism of acetylation/deacetylation that GABPα , an activator , and ETV4 , a repressor , employ to restrict and promote ZRS activation in the distal limb bud . 2 Results In order to characterize specific features of the Shh limb enhancer , the ZRS , in different regions of the developing limb , we microdissected the limb bud at embryonic day 11 . 5 ( E11 . 5 ) into several defined segments . Firstly , we examined the distal region which contained the specialized epithelial structure called the AER ( apical ectodermal ridge ) , the mesenchyme of both the progress zone and the ZPA and , in addition , the proximal region which contained the shank of the limb bud ( Figure 1A ) . Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysed by quantitative PCR ( ChIP-qPCR ) was performed on the dissected limb tissue for the two modified histones , H3K4me1 and H3K27ac ( Figure 1B ) . Previous studies demonstrated that these modifications are markers for enhancer activity . H3K4me1 is a predictive chromatin signature for both poised and active enhancers in the human genome ( Heintzman et al . , 2007 ) , but in association with H3K27ac , these mark active regulatory elements ( Rada-Iglesias et al . , 2012; Cotney et al . , 2012 ) . We found specific enrichment of H3K4me1 at the ZRS in the distal region of the dissected E11 . 5 limb buds , which was appreciably lower in the proximal region of the limb buds . Further dissections of the distal limb bud into anterior and posterior halves enabled us to discern more precisely the location of the H3K4me1 at the ZRS ( Figure 1B ) . Even though Shh was not expressed in the anterior region of the limb bud , the H3K4me1 mark was enriched in both dissected halves suggesting that the ZRS was poised across the distal compartment of the limb . H3K27ac , in contrast , was differentially enriched in the distal mesenchyme which was greater in the posterior portion of the limb bud . To investigate acetylation of histone H3 across the large 770 bp enhancer , two sets of PCR primers were used to amplify each end of the ZRS . The ZRS encompasses two distinct regulatory activities; one residing in the 5’ half driving spatiotemporal expression and one residing in the 3’ half mediating long-range activation of the Shh gene ( Lettice et al . , 2014 ) ( Figure 1C ) . Analysis of each half of the enhancer after ChIP identified differential acetylation of H3 across the ZRS . PCR primers complementary to the 5’ spatiotemporal half ( 5’ST primers ) of the ZRS showed an increase in H3 acetylation compared to the 3’ long-range ( 3’LR primers ) end . H3K27ac was associated with the 5’ end of the ZRS and was enriched in the distal region of the limb bud . H3K27ac was , therefore , associated with the distal , posterior quadrant of the limb bud consistent with the presence of the ZPA where the Shh gene is transcriptionally active ( Figure 1A ) . Hence , in the case of the ZRS , the enhancer is poised throughout the posterior distal mesenchyme; further events occur to activate the enhancer for productive transcription in the ZPA . We next assessed the chromatin state of the ZRS in the distal region of the limb bud using ChIP coupled with microarray called ChIP-on-chip . The ChIP analysis using antibodies to H3K4me1 and H3K27ac highlighted the specificity of the histone modifications over the ZRS ( Figure 1D ) . The pattern of the H3K4me1 covered the extent of the ZRS; whereas , the pattern of H3K27ac , as predicted by the PCR primers , was not centred over the ZRS but was skewed toward the 5’ side . Thus , the ZRS exists in differential chromatin states in the limb depending on position and gene activity . To investigate the dynamics of Shh regulation in relation to the ZRS , we generated immortalized cell lines from early limb bud mesenchyme ( Williamson et al . , 2012 ) . RNA-seq analysis of the 14Fp cell line ( cells derived from the distal/posterior part of the limb at E 11 . 5 ) shows that many of the key genes found in the posterior limb bud are expressed with a notable exception being Shh ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1A ) . We performed ChIP-on-chip using antibodies against H3K4me1 and H3K27ac which revealed that , H3K4me1 marked the full extent of the ZRS in the cell line; whereas , H3K27ac was not enriched , demonstrating that the ZRS resides in a poised state reflecting the origin of the cell line from the distal mesenchyme of the limb bud ( Figure 2A and Figure 2—figure supplement 1A ) . The poised state of the ZRS in the cells indicated that Shh inactivation was due to the lack of specific factors that are responsible for fully activating the ZRS . Previous attempts to activate Shh expression in limb bud-derived cells using cocktails of known developmental activators such as FGFs and retinoic acid or transfection with HoxD genes have shown that Shh is refractory to activation ( Kimura and Ide , 1998 ) . Our attempts with known Shh activators confirmed these observations ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2A ) ; however , the drug trichostatin A ( TSA ) , a histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibitor , stimulated expression ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2B–C ) . Shh expression was detectable within 6 hr of treatment ( Figure 2B ) reaching a maximum at ~24 hr . To further investigate Shh activation in the cell line , we carried out a TSA time course to assay H3K27ac enrichment at the ZRS . H3K27ac enrichment was observed over both the ZRS and the Shh promoter at 16 hr of treatment , reaching a maximum at 24 hr ( Figure 2C ) , accordingly , with the Shh expression time course ( Figure 2B ) . The fold enrichment of H3K27ac in the limb buds ( Figure 1B ) and cell lines ( Figure 2C ) seemed dramatically different; therefore , enrichment of H3K27ac was directly compared between the limbs buds and the cells in the same experiment showing that the magnitude of enrichment is comparable ( Figure 2—figure supplement 3A ) . In the cell lines , the correlation between Shh induction of expression and recruitment of H3K27ac suggests that the ZRS is involved in the activation of the transcriptional process . In addition H3K27ac was more highly associated with the region involved in the spatiotemporal activity of the ZRS ( as shown using the 5’ST primers ) . Two control mouse cell lines were used to investigate the specificity of Shh activation in the 14Fp cells . Firstly , the mouse ES cell line , E14 , which in response to retinoic acid induces Shh expression , and secondly , an immortalized mesenchymal cell line from the embryonic mandible at E11 . 5 , called the MD cell line , were used . In both cell lines , the histone mark , H3K4me1 , was not enriched over the ZRS , and TSA treatment did not lead to Shh induction after 24 hr of treatment ( Figure 2—figure supplement 3B–C ) . Extragenic transcription sites correlate with active regulatory elements and in accord are occupied by RNA Pol II ( De Santa et al . , 2010; Kim et al . , 2010 ) . Genome-wide studies highlighted Pol II occupancy and the synthesis of noncoding transcripts at active enhancer sites , the roles of which , so far , remain unclear . In order to confirm the limb specific enhancer activation , Pol II ChIP-qPCR was carried out in limb cells after TSA treatment . In the untreated 14Fp cell line , even though the enhancer is in a poised state , Pol II was not appreciably enriched at the Shh promoter nor at the ZRS ( Figure 2D ) . After activation with TSA , Pol II was detected at both sites confirming the association of Pol II recruitment to the enhancer and the promoter , further suggesting that TSA mediated Shh activation in 14Fp involves the ZRS . Thus , this cell line derived from early limb bud mesenchyme showed that the ZRS could be induced to undergo modifications consistent with enhancer activation and concomitantly , Shh expression was activated . To further establish the role for ZRS in the activation of Shh expression in the cell line , the interaction of the ZRS with its target promoter was analysed . Shh gene activation is linked to an increase in the level of the H3K27ac histone mark over the ZRS . In order to investigate the reorganization of chromatin structure after TSA treatment and to confirm the involvement of the ZRS in Shh activation induced by TSA , circularized chromosome conformation capture ( 4C-seq ) ( Stadhouders et al . , 2013 ) analysis was carried out at 18 and 24 hr after TSA treatment ( Figure 2—figure supplement 3D–F ) . Evidence of increased co-localization of the ZRS and the Shh gene in the expressing region of the limb bud was demonstrated previously by FISH and 3C analysis ( Amano et al . , 2009 , Williamson et al . , 2016 ) . 4C-seq analysis in the 14Fp cell line ( Figure 3A ) showed marked and highly signiﬁcant ZRS–Shh interactions in the TSA treated cells . The interaction between the Shh gene and the ZRS was confirmed by 3C-qPCR ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1E ) . The fragment containing the promoter site of Shh co-localizes with the ZRS and was detected at 18 and at 24 hr after TSA treatment ( TSA minus: q < 1 . 5×10−5; TSA18hr: q-value <5×10−10; TSA+24hr: q < 7 . 8×10−35 ) ; whereas , signiﬁcant contact in the fragment containing the promoter was undetectable in the untreated cells . Shh/ZRS proximity in the nucleus occurs regardless of whether the gene or enhancer is active ( Williamson et al . , 2016 ) ; however , in TSA treated cells reorganization in chromatin structure occurs due to activation of the ZRS increasing interactions with the promoter . At an early stage of limb development , Fgf10 expression in the distal limb bud mesenchyme is important for both limb bud outgrowth and induction of FGF signalling from the AER ( Ohuchi et al . , 1997 ) which , in turn , maintains the cells of the progress zone . Subsequently , the FGFs function to maintain Shh expression in the ZPA ( Laufer et al . , 1994; Niswander et al . , 1994; Crossley et al . , 1996; Vogel et al . , 1996; Ohuchi et al . , 1997 ) . We tested the hypothesis that localized FGF expression is correlated with the poised state of the ZRS . Firstly , the 14Fp cell line pre-treated with nintedanib ( NIN ) , a potent broad spectrum inhibitor of FGFR1/2/3 , VEGFR1/2/3 , and PDGFRα/β ( Hilberg et al . , 2008 ) , showed a significant reduction in Shh after TSA treatment ( Figure 4A ) . Previous studies show that an increase in AER-FGF levels leads to gradual repression of Grem1 in the distal mesenchyme as part of an inhibitory feedback loop ( Fgf/Grem1 loop ) ( Verheyden and Sun , 2008 ) and promotes expression of Etv4 ( Mao et al . , 2009 ) . Hence , as control for the efficiency of the FGF inhibition , Grem1 and Etv4 levels were evaluated ( Figure 4B ) after 4 hr incubation with NIN or after 4 hr NIN plus FGF8/10 incubation . Since NIN can also inhibit VEGF and PDGF receptors , another FGFR inhibitor , BGJ398 ( BGJ ) , was also tested for Grem1 and Etv4 expression . Increased levels of Grem1 were observed after 4 hr of NIN and BGJ incubations while Etv4 levels were reduced . The FGF8/10 treatment was sufficient to restore the original levels of both Grem1 and Etv4 . To investigate the action of FGF signalling at the ZRS , ChIP for H3K4me1 in the limb specific cell line exposed to NIN was performed ( Figure 4C ) . As control , a region of the first intron of Rbm33 , a neighbouring gene , which displays open chromatin coincident with a peak of H3K4me1 was examined . The H3K4me1 enrichment over the ZRS was dramatically reduced after inhibition of FGF activity and TSA treatment did not rescue the presence of this histone modification; whereas , Rbm33 intron 1 was not significantly affected . The same effect was caused by BGJ on H3K4me1 enrichment ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1D–E ) , and no differences were observed in comparison with NIN treatment . To assess whether the NIN or BGJ treatment would affect cell survival or cause other abnormality trypan blue staining was performed and no alterations were observed after 4 hr treatment ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1A ) . To determine if FGF plays a similar role in effecting the poised state of the ZRS in the embryo , we developed a short-term organ culture approach ( Havis et al . , 2014 ) . Distal tips of E11 . 5 limb buds were dissected , maintained in media , and exposed to NIN for 4 hr to examine the state of endogenous ZRS . In agreement with the cell line results , the distal tips lost ZRS enrichment of H3K4me1 and higher levels of Grem1 expression were observed ( Figure 4F–G ) . On the other hand , when proximal dissections of E11 . 5 limb bud , where the enhancer is in an inactive state , are exposed to a combination of FGF8 and FGF10 the ZRS displays the poised state ( Figure 4H , Figure 4—figure supplement 1F ) showing enrichment of H3K4me1 . These data suggest that FGF signalling has a key role in priming and maintaining the ZRS as a poised enhancer in the distal mesenchyme of the limb bud , delineating the boundaries where Shh can be potentially expressed . Trypan blue staining was performed on limb dissections by following a reported protocol with slight modifications ( Siddique , 2012 ) ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1B ) . No signs of increased cell death were observed after 4 hr of NIN treatment . The 14Fp cells retain the expression of some of the ETS genes ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1A ) which were shown to play a regulatory role at the ZRS ( Lettice et al . , 2012 ) . One of these , GABPα , interacts with the ZRS in the limb bud and activates Shh expression . In addition others have demonstrated ( Kang et al . , 2008 ) that GABPα recruits the co-activator histone acetyltransferase ( HAT ) CBP/p300 . Therefore , binding of GABPα to the ZRS and recruitment of p300 was examined in the 14Fp cell line ( Figure 5A ) . ChIP-on-chip analysis on untreated cells for both GABPα and p300 showed an overlapping peak of enrichment for both factors , suggesting a co-occupancy over the ZRS . To further study the interaction between these factors , we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments on nuclear extracts from 14Fp cells transfected with GABPα tagged with three copies of the flag epitope . Immunoprecipitation of endogenous p300 co-precipitates the flag-GABPα indicating an association between these two factors ( Figure 5B ) . Western blot for p300 normalized against the histone H3 showed that p300 levels were not affected ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1B ) . Based on the assumption that GABPα and p300 together have an important , yet undefined role in the activation of the regulatory element , we next addressed whether the presence of GABPα/p300 influenced ZRS activation . Shh expression was examined in cells induced with TSA after reduction of Gabpa expression . Gabpα small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) knockdown ( Figure 5C ) revealed decreased Shh expression after TSA treatment ( Figure 5D ) . Conversely , overexpression of Gabpα using a doxycycline inducible vector leads to activation of Shh ( Figure 5E , Figure 5—figure supplement 1A ) . In addition , ChIP analysis for H3K27ac in cells overexpressing GABPα showed an appreciable enrichment over the ZRS; whereas , the transcription factor ETV4 , a repressor ( see below ) which restricts expression outside the ZPA , is displaced from the ZRS ( Figure 5F ) . Under these conditions , enrichment of GABPα and p300 over the ZRS is also observed ( Figure 5G ) . These data suggest that GABPα regulates Shh expression by modulating the acetylation status of H3K27 of the ZRS . Furthermore , FGF signalling plays a central role , since both GABPα and p300 are released from the ZRS when FGF signalling is inhibited by NIN and the enhancer is no longer poised ( Figure 4D–E ) . FGF , therefore , mediates priming of the ZRS enabling the binding of GABPα which , in turn , recruits p300 . ETV4/ETV5 binding represses Shh expression outside the ZPA in the limb bud ( Lettice et al . , 2012 ) . Since there is a close association between GABPα and p300 , we investigated the possibility that the repressive role of ETV4/ETV5 was related to HDAC activity . In order to investigate specific HDAC candidates , RNA-seq data obtained from the cell line and the distal and proximal portions of the limb bud showed nearly all the HDAC classes are represented in both 14Fp and in limb tissue between the cells and the tissue , with the exception of HDAC9 ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1B ) . Most of the HDACs represented were subjected to ChIP in 14Fp ( HDAC1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 8 , and 9 ) and HDAC2 appeared significantly enriched over the ZRS ( data not shown ) and is one of the most abundant Hdac in the RNA samples analysed ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1B ) . To further examine the role of HDACs in ZRS activity , Hdac2 and Hdac1 expression levels were reduced by specific siRNAs in 14Fp cells ( Figure 6A ) . Both are class I HDACs and often work in concert . Hdac1 downregulation had no effect on Shh expression , while the reduction of Hdac2 levels ( by siRNA ) in 14Fp showed an increase in Shh levels . Simultaneous reduction of both Hdac1 and Hdac2 did not have an additive effect on the induction of Shh ( Figure 6A ) . To investigate the relationship between the repressor activity of the ETV genes and HDAC2 , we performed ChIP-on-chip for these two factors to visualize their distribution over the ZRS ( Figure 6B ) . Since in the 14Fp cell line ETV5 expression is low ( approximately eightfold to tenfold lower than ETV4 ) ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–B ) , depletion of ETV5 activity was not necessary in this analysis . ETV4 exhibits two peaks encompassing the ZRS which correspond to the two ETV4 binding sites ( Lettice et al . , 2012 ) ; interestingly , the HDAC2 peak overlapped one of these peaks located at the 3’ end which encodes the long-range activity of the regulatory element ( Lettice et al . , 2014 ) . We next tested if HDAC2 and ETV4 were able to physically interact; analysis showed that endogenous ETV4 co-immunoprecipitated with HDAC2 ( Figure 6C ) . In addition , the negative role of ETV4 on Shh expression in 14Fp cells ( Figure 6D ) was investigated . Etv4 levels were reduced with siRNA , resulting in a ~40% decrease in ETV4 and a significant activation of Shh expression ( Figure 6D ) . ChIP using anti-ETV4 and HDAC2 antibodies performed on TSA treated cells showed that ETV4 together with HDAC2 are displaced from the ZRS ( Figure 6E ) , suggesting that ETV4 opposes GABPα activity by maintaining lower levels of H3K27ac . 3 Discussion The ZPA is the organizing centre of the early developing limb bud and the restricted expression of Shh at this location along the posterior boundary is crucial for correct specification of digit identity and number . Various regulatory inputs are essential to acquire this spatial specific pattern of expression ( Figure 7 ) . We showed that an initial input is the event that primes the ZRS , such that the enhancer is poised but transcriptionally inactive . The ZRS priming occurs in a broad region of the distal limb bud mesenchyme that includes tissue that will not express Shh in addition to the ZPA . Furthermore , we undertook studies to identify the signalling pathway involved in the induction of ZRS priming . Distal limb mesenchyme , referred to as the progress zone , is known to be under the influence of the FGFs produced in the AER ( Laufer et al . , 1994; Niswander et al . , 1994; Crossley et al . , 1996; Vogel et al . , 1996; Ohuchi et al . , 1997 ) and we showed that FGFs can induce ZRS priming in distal mesenchyme; whereas , inhibition of FGF signalling results in chromatin changes and loss of H3K4me1 and loss of transcription factor binding suggesting that the ZRS is no longer recognized as a poised enhancer and is in a ‘closed’ configuration . Thus , one role of FGF signalling is the establishment and maintenance of ZRS priming . Activation of the ZRS , therefore , appears to be a two-step process; ZRS priming occurring broadly in the distal mesenchyme which is a prerequisite for subsequent action by other signals in the posterior region containing the ZPA to activate the ZRS . The poised state of the enhancer is notable in light of the response of the ZRS to the point mutations that cause PPD2 and other associated skeletal abnormalities ( Anderson et al . , 2012 ) . These mutations cause misregulation of Shh expression in the developing limb bud such that Shh expression occurs at an ectopic anterior site in the distal mesenchyme in addition to the ZPA . Ectopic expression of all ZRS mutations examined , thus far , is restricted to the distal mesenchyme suggesting that there is a requirement for the ZRS to be in a poised state in order to be activated and demonstrates a mechanism for Shh ectopic activation restricted to the distal mesenchyme of the limb bud . Attempts to understand how developmental enhancers operate over such large distances have led to the general idea that chromatin looping assists the interactions of a long-range enhancer with its target promoter ( Sanyal et al . , 2012 ) . In the limb bud , 3C assay revealed a physical interaction between the ZRS and the promoter ( Amano et al . , 2009 ) . Here , we confirmed , that upon activation of Shh expression in the limb-derived cell line , there is highly specific co-localization of the ZRS with the Shh promoter fragment . Thus , the Shh limb regulator in the cell line exists in two states; one in which the ZRS is poised reflecting its origin from the distal mesenchyme of the developing limb bud and secondly , in an active state in which the ZRS and the promoter recruit Pol II and interact . Hence , the cell line reveals the chromatin dynamics that occur during long-range activation . GABPα/ETS1 and ETV4/ETV5 have antagonistic effects on Shh activity in the limb . Occupancy at multiple GABPα/ETS1 sites in the ZRS regulates the position of the ZPA boundary , whereas ETV4/ETV5 binding acts as repressors to restrict expression outside the ZPA . We have hypothesized that the balance between these activator and repressor factors is responsible for regulating activity levels in the developing limb bud ( Lettice et al . , 2012 ) . Here , we showed that GABPα and ETV4 bind to the ZRS in the cell lines similar to that in the limb bud . GABPα is associated with p300 HAT at the ZRS in the cell lines . Previous reports demonstrated that GABPα physically interacts with p300 in myeloid cells ( Resendes and Rosmarin , 2006 ) . Activation of AChR ( nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ) gene in subsynaptic nuclei in adult skeletal muscle is mediated by GABPα , which recruits the HAT p300 to the AChR ε-subunit promoter ( Ravel-Chapuis et al . , 2007 ) . Furthermore , the surface of the GABPα OST domain binds to the CH1 and CH3 domains of the co-activator HAT CBP/p300 ( Kang et al . , 2008 ) . Here , we showed in the limb-derived cells that a similar interaction of these two factors occurs . In addition , overexpression of GABPα results in an increase in the levels of H3K27ac at the ZRS . A correlation between Gabpα expression and the presence of ETV4 at the ZRS is also observed; in that , expression of Gabpα results in a displacement of ETV4 at the enhancer . Thus GABPα operates at the ZRS to increase levels of H3K27ac by recruiting p300 and decreasing levels of the repressor ETV4 . ETV4 appears to operate in the opposite manner and is one of the dominant factors in maintaining the ZRS in a poised state . Reduction of ETV4 levels is sufficient to activate Shh expression . ETV4 interacts with HDAC2 and we further showed the co-localization of HDAC2 and ETV4 at the ZRS in the cell line . Similar to the downregulation of ETV4 the knockdown of HDAC2 induces Shh . Activation of Shh by TSA releases ETV4 and HDAC2 from the ZRS . Hence activation of the ZRS by both the overexpression of GABPα and treatment with TSA is associated with loss of ETV4 binding which acts directly on HDAC activity . The FGFs play a central role in Shh expression by ensuring that the ZRS maintains its primed state throughout the distal limb mesenchyme . This widespread priming , however , opens the ZRS for potential ectopic activation as occurs in preaxial polydactyly and associated phenotypes ( Anderson et al . , 2012 ) . ETV4 is a repressor that restricts this activity and FGF signalling also induces the levels of ETV4 in the distal mesenchyme of the limb bud ( Mao et al . , 2009; Zhang et al . , 2009 ) . The FGFs , therefore , operate by regulating two contrasting events; firstly , by effecting the chromatin in the distal mesenchyme ensuring that the ZRS is maintained in a poised state and secondly , acting counter to enhancer activation by inducing the level of a repressor that ensures Shh expression does not occur outside the region of the ZPA . 4 Materials and methods The 14Fp cell line was derived from the posterior third of distal forelimb buds from an Immortomouse ( H-2k-tsA58 ) ( Jat et al . , 1991 ) . Cells are plated in DMEM ( Invitrogen , Loughborough , UK ) with 10% Foetal Calf Serum ( Sigma-Aldrich , Gillingham , UK ) , Penicillin/Streptomycin and 20 ng/ml Interferon ( Peprotech , London , UK ) . Cells are grown at 33°C the permissive temperature for the temperature-sensitive T antigen and were passaged as necessary but no later than passage 12 . Cells biological replicates are intended as cells cultured separately and treated/analysed at a different passage . Cellular identity was confirmed by RNA expression analysis of specific genes and immortomouse markers and verified to be mycoplasma free . Knockdown of endogenous proteins was performed in 14fp cells after siRNA transfection using Dharmafect one solution ( Dharmacon ) . Briefly , cells were seeded in six-well plates to 40% confluence and after 24 hr were transfected using 25 nM of each siRNA pool and 10 μl of the transfection reagent . The transfection medium was replaced after 12 hr and cells were grown for another 12 hr . Cells were collected 24 hr after the transfection for analyses . siRNA pools were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific ( Ambion ) : Gabpα ( s66354 , s66355 ) , Etv4 ( s71463 , s201776 ) , Hdac2 ( s67417 , s67416 ) , Hdac1 ( s119557 , s119558 ) , and nontargeting siRNAs ( control ) ( D-001810-02 ) . The siRNA were used separately . Unless otherwise specified , the cells were treated with HDAC inhibitors TSA ( 1 μM ) for 24 hr before cell harvest and NIN ( 100 nM ) and BGJ ( 2 . 5 μM ) for 4 hr . Cell cultures were incubated , when necessary , with 500 ng/ml of FGF10 ( R&D Systems , Abingdon , UK catalogue no . 345-FG ) and 100 ng/ml of FGF8 ( Abcam , Cambridge , UK , ab205522 ) combination for 6 hr after NIN treatments . Limb buds were dissected from E11 . 5 mouse embryos and cultured as described by Havis et al . ( 2014 ) with the following modifications . Limb dissections obtained from different embryos were considered as biological replicates . Briefly distal dissections were treated with NIN ( 100 nM ) for 4 hr . Proximal dissections were incubated with 500 ng/ml of FGF10 ( R and D Systems , catalogue no . 345-FG ) and 100 ng/ml of FGF8 ( ABCAM , ab205522 ) combination for 6 hr . Inhibitors were diluted in DMSO . Media with buffers only were used as controls . After treatments , explants were processed for qRT-PCR or ChIP . Trypan blue staining was performed on limb dissections by following a reported protocol with slight modifications ( Siddique , 2012 ) . Total limb dissections were collected and treated 4 hr with NIN or media alone . The limbs were then transferred to trypan blue stain and kept in shaking condition for 20 min . Eight limb dissections were directly stained after collection ( T0 ) . The samples were washed thoroughly with PBS solution again for 15 more minutes and observed by microscope and imaged to check for any cell damage . Crosslinked ChIP was performed as described ( Stock et al . , 2007 ) from approximately 107 cells per experiment . All antibodies used in this study have been previously reported as suitable for ChIP and/or ChIP-seq , p300 ( sc-585 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Heidelberg , Germany ) , H3K4me1 ( ab8895 , Abcam ) , H3K27ac ( s39133 , Active Motif , La Hulpe , Belguim ) , HDAC2 ( ab16032 ) , GABPα ( sc-22810 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , with the exception at ETV4 ( ABE635 , Millipore , Loughborough , UK ) . All statistical analyses were performed using a two-tailed Student’s t-test . 3C was conducted according to the protocol described by Stadhouders et al . , 2013 with minor alterations . In brief cells were treated with 1 mM TSA for 18 and 24 hr or DMSO as a control and fixed in 2% formaldehyde solution for 10 min . Glycine ( 0 . 125 M ) was used to quench the reaction . After a PBS wash and 15 min incubation in lysis buffer , the solution was spun down and nuclei stored at −80°C until needed . If more than 5 × 105 cells were used , pellets were made up in 1 . 2× restriction buffer and divided into four aliquots to reduce formation of aggregates . Primary restriction enzyme digestion was conducted using 800 U HindIII-HF restriction enzyme ( NEB ) at 37°C on each aliquot . Before ligation aliquots were combined and T4 DNA ligase ( New England Biolabs , Evry , France ) added and incubated at 16°C overnight . HindIII digested samples were analysed on a 0 . 6% agarose gel and appear as high molecular weight smear running from roughly 4 to 12 kb ( Figure 2—figure supplement 3D , Figure 3—figure supplement 1A ) . 3C libraries were analysed on 0 . 6% agarose gel and appear as a high molecular weight band ( around 12 kb ) ( Figure 2—figure supplement 3E , Figure 3—figure supplement 1B ) . To this point the 3C libraries were analysed ( see below ) . In order to make 4C libraries a second restriction digest was performed using the four-cutter MluCI ( Roche , Burgess Hill , UK ) at 37°C overnight and second ligation with T4 DNA ligase ( New England Biolabs ) . MluCI digested samples were analysed on a 1 . 5% gel appearing as smear between roughly 0 . 3 and 1 kb ( Figure 2—figure supplement 3F ) . Finally , 4C libraries were purified using QIA quick PCR purification kit ( Qiagen , Germantown , MD , USA ) to produce final purified 4C libraries . After PCR amplification and purification ( Table ST2 ) , sequencing adaptors were ligated and 4C libraries sequenced using in-house Ion Proton sequencing . De-multiplexed sequencing reads ( fastq files ) can be summarized: first we trimmed known bait sequence using cutadapt ( Martin , 2011 ) and selected only those reads where known viewpoint-associated sequence was present . Reads were mapped to the mouse reference genome ( build mm9 ) using bowtie2 ( Langmead and Salzberg , 2012 ) with the very-sensitive flag 3 . Alignments were filtered with a MAPping Quality ( MAPQ ) score >30 to select for high-confidence alignments using SAMtools ( Li et al . , 2009 ) . Contacts were then normalized using the r3cseq R package and assigned false discovery rate q-values to interactions , with the aim of finding those significantly over-represented relative to expectation . The normalization procedure for 4C data is adapted from a previous method for normalizing deepCAGE data between samples ( Balwierz et al . , 2009 ) . Digestion efficiency and sample purity was assessed as described previously ( Hagège et al . , 2007 ) . Primers were designed using Primer3 with an anchor primer in the fragment at the 5’ end of the ZRS and in potential interacting fragments around the Shh promoter , gene body , 3’ end , and gene desert . qPCR was carried out using the Roche LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master and Roche LightCycler 480 probe Master on a Roche LC480 according to the instructions of the manufacturer ( Roche ) . Two PACs , RCPI21-542n10 ( 148 kb long covering Rnf32 to 5’ of LMBR1 ) and RCPI21-508F15 ( 203 kb long covering Shh and 150 kb 5’ ) obtained from RPCI21 library ( HGMP Resource Centre , Cambridge , United Kingdom ) , were used as a PCR control template . The PAC clones were cut with HindIII and equimolar amounts re-ligated by T4 DNA ligase . All primer pairs were tested on a standard curve of the BAC control library and yielded PCR efficiencies > 1 . 7 . The presence of a single PCR product was confirmed and melting curves analysed . Cycling conditions were: 95°C for 5 min , 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s , 60°C for 30 s , 72°C for 30 s . qPCR data were normalized to ZRS 3’LR ChIP oligos as a loading control . 3C oligos from Splinter et al . ( 2006 ) were used to control for interaction frequencies between samples . ZRS 3’LR ChIP oligos cycling conditions were 95°C for 5 min , 40 cycles of 95°C for 10 s , 60°C for 30 s , 72°C for 30 s . The cycling conditions for the interacting fragments and the anchor were 95°C for 5 min , 45 cycles of 95°C for 15 s , 60°C for 1 min , 72°C for 1 s . Data analysis was carried out according to Hagège et al . ( 2007 ) and is presented as relative crosslinking frequency . The primers used for the chromatin conformation capture interaction studies are listed in Table S2 . Cells from dissected E11 . 5 limbs and 14fp were fixed with 1% formaldehyde ( 25°C , 10 min ) and stopped with 0 . 125 M glycine . Crosslinked ChIP was performed as described ( Stock et al . , 2007 ) . In brief , the nuclei were sonicated using a Diagenode Bioruptor ( Leige , full power 30 s on , 30 s off , in an ice bath for 50 min ) to produce fragments of <300 bp . Chromatin ( 350 mg ) was incubated with 5 mg prebound ( to Protein A or G magnetic beads , Invitrogen ) IgG ( Santa Cruz , sc-2025 ) or the previously mentioned antibodies , raised to in the presence of 50 mg of BSA , washed , and eluted . Reverse crosslinked DNA was purified with Proteinase K ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) and QIAGEN PCR purification kit . qPCR of the ChIP experiments was carried out using equal concentrations of input , IgG , and Chip DNA using a Sybr Green ( Roche ) reaction . From each biological replicate three technical replicates were analysed . Enrichment values for ChIP samples from limb bud sections extracts are presented either as percentage of input or as fold differences relative to IgG and normalized to input with the formula 2 ( [CtIgG-CtInput]−[CtAb-CtInput] ) where Ct values are threshold cycles . All biological replicates were carried out in duplicate unless stated . Primers used for ZRS and the controls are shown in Table ST1 . For the custom Nimblegen tiling arrays ChIP DNA and input DNA ChIP DNA and input DNA were amplified ( WGA2 kit , Sigma ) , labelled , and hybridized according to the manufacturer’s protocol to a 354 , 999 unique probe custom microarray containing specific tiled regions of the mouse genome ( Nimblegen , Roche ) . For the Agilent arrays a custom tiling array was designed including some of the genes involved in limb development , including gene deserts associated with such genes . GEO accession number for the ChIP data is GSE104074 and GSE104208 . Microarray data were analysed in R/Bioconductor ( http://genomebiology . com/2004/5/10/R80 ) with the Epigenome ( PROT43 ) protocol ( https://www . epigenesys . eu/images/stories/protocols/pdf/20111025114444_p43 . pdf ) with the following parameters . The mean signal intensity of the two replicate probes on each array was taken . Loess normalization was used within arrays to correct for the dye bias , and scale normalization was used within the replicates group to control interarray variability using the R package ( Ritchie et al . , 2015 ) . The log2 enrichment for each ChIP group was calculated by subtracting the mean of log2 input intensities from the mean of d enriched intensities and averaging over the two biological replicates . The Median Signal was extracted from the scanned image files and processed using the R package ( Toedling et al . , 2007 ) . Probe intensities were transformed from raw values into background-corrected normalized log ratios ( ChIP/Input ) using Ringo's preprocess method ( VSN normalization ) . Smoothing over individual probe intensities was performed using a sliding window of 1000 bp along the chromosome and replacing the intensity at the genomic position by the median over the intensities of those reporters inside the window . The pSV40-Tet3G- pTRE3G-mCherry- Gabpα plasmid was generated using the In-Fusion cloning technology ( Clontech , St Germaine en Laye , France catalogue no . 639649 ) . First , the pTRE3G-mCherry vector ( Clontech , catalogue nos . 631160 and 631175 ) was linearized using a unique restriction site between the origin of replication and the Tet-responsive promoter ( pTRE3G ) . Second , the sequences encoding for SV40 promoter , Kanamycin/Neomycin resistance , internal ribosome entry site IRES2 , and Tet-ON 3G transactivator were inserted . Third , we removed the Ampicillin resistance cassette . Lastly , the sequence of the self-cleaving peptide P2A was cloned between the mCherry fluorescent marker and the 3xFLAG tagged Gabpα gene , in order to generate a bicistronic expression under the control of the TRE3G promoter and an empty control vector was also used . Overexpression analyses were performed in 14fp cells by transfecting plasmids using Lipofectamine LTX with plus reagent ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) and following standard manufacturer’s protocol . Nuclear extracts used in the immunoprecipitation were prepared from 14fp using a NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction kit ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) . The nuclear extract was incubated with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel ( Sigma ) for 3 hr at 4°C . The beads were washed three times with washing buffer . The immunoprecipitates were eluted with 1× SDS buffer , separated on a 4–20% Novex Tris-Glycine SDS-PAGE gel ( Invitrogen ) , transferred to a PVDF membrane ( Millipore ) , incubated with anti-FLAG ( Sigma ) or with anti-GABPα ( Santa Cruz , sc-22810 ) . Total RNA was prepared using Trizol reagent ( Invitrogen ) according to manufacturer’s protocol ( for limb buds , dissected anterior , posterior , distal , and proximal tissue was dissociated into single cell suspensions in Trizol using a syringe fitted with a 25G ( 0 . 5 mm ) needle ( Sigma Aldrich , BD Microlance ) , followed by acid phenol:chloroform:isopropyl alcohol extraction , and then digested with 2U DNaseI ( ThermoFisher Scientific , Ambion ) for 30 min at 37°C ) . RNA was reverse-transcribed to complementary DNA ( cDNA ) using QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit ( Qiagen ) . The quantitative real-time PCRs were performed in a 7300 system ( ThermoFisher Scientific , Applied Biosystems , Life Technologies ) by using LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master ( Roche ) and gene specific primer sets for shh , Gabpα , and Etv4 . The cycle threshold ( CT ) values from all quantitative real-time PCR experiments were analysed using ΔΔCT method . Data were normalized to GAPDH and expressed as fold changes over that in control treatment group . From each biological replicate three technical replicates were analysed . All statistical analyses were performed using a two-tailed Student’s t-test . RNA sequencing was conducted by GATC Biotech ( Konstantz , Germany ) . Samples were only submitted with an OD 260/280 ratio ≥1 . 8 , a 260/230 ratio ≥1 . 7 , and a RNA Integrity Number value ≥8 as detected by Agilent Technologies 2100 Bionalayser . The InView Transcriptome Explore service provided by GATC was used to provide a randomly primed and amplified cDNA library with Illumina adaptors ready for sequencing . Illumina sequencing was conducted producing 50 bp single end reads and a guarantee of over 30 million reads per sample . All samples were analysed on the main Galaxy server by first checking sequence quality by FastQC . Reads were then trimmed and any Illumina sequencing adaptors removed as appropriate and aligned to the mouse genome ( mm9 , NCBI 37 ) using Tophat2 ( Galaxy Tool Version 0 . 9 ) . The results for each condition were fed into Cuffdiff ( Galaxy Tool Version 2 . 2 . 1 . 3 ) and visualized using the R Bioconductor package CummeRbund ( Release 3 . 2 ) . This process was repeated using RNA isolated from both immortalized limb cell lines and isolated limb tissue . Two biological replicates were analysed for each condition ."}

Its essentiality may favor the accumulation of cryptic genetic variation ( CGV ) that has no effect in the wild-type but that enhances or suppresses the effects of rare disruptions to gene function . Here , we adapted a classical modifier screen to interrogate the alleles segregating in natural populations of Caenorhabditis elegans: we induced gene knockdowns and used quantitative genetic methodology to examine how segregating variants modify the penetrance of embryonic lethality . Each perturbation revealed CGV , indicating that wild-type genomes harbor myriad genetic modifiers that may have little effect individually but which in aggregate can dramatically influence penetrance . Phenotypes were mediated by many modifiers , indicating high polygenicity , but the alleles tend to act very specifically , indicating low pleiotropy . Our findings demonstrate the extent of conditional functionality in complex trait architecture .", "plain language summary": "Individuals of the same species have similar , but generally not identical , DNA sequences . This ‘genetic variation’ is due to random changes in the DNA—known as mutations—that occur among individuals . These mutations may be passed on to these individuals' offspring , who in turn pass them on to their descendants . Some of these mutations may have a positive or negative effect on the ability of the organisms to survive and reproduce , but others may have no effect at all . The process by which an embryo forms ( which is called embryogenesis ) follows a precisely controlled series of events . Within the same species , there is genetic variation in the DNA that programs embryogenesis , but it is not clear what effect this variation has on how the embryo develops . Here , Paaby et al . adapted a genetics technique called a ‘modifier screen’ to study how genetic variation affects the development of a roundworm known as Caenorhabditis elegans . The experiments show that populations of worms harbor a lot of genetic variation that affects how they tolerate the loss of an important gene . One by one , Paaby et al . interrupted the activity of specific genes that embryos need in order to develop . How this affected the embryo , and whether or not it was able to survive , was due in large part to the naturally-occurring genetic variation in other genes in these worms . Paaby et al . 's findings serve as a reminder that the effect of a mutation depends on other DNA sequences in the organism . In humans , for example , a gene that causes a genetic disease may produce severe symptoms in one patient but mild symptoms in another . Future experiments will reveal the details of how genetic variation affects embryogenesis , which may also provide new insights into how complex processes in animals evolve over time .", "article": "1 Introduction The effect of gene disruption on an organism depends on a combination of the gene's function and the genetic background in which it resides ( Chandler et al . , 2013; Chari and Dworkin , 2013; Vu et al . , 2015 ) . The average human genome contains loss-of-function alleles for 100 or more genes , some of which cause known genetic diseases ( Abecasis et al . , 2010; MacArthur et al . , 2012 ) ; disease expression depends on exposure of the disease allele , such as by homozygosity , but also on variants elsewhere in the genome that act as penetrance modifiers ( Hamilton and Yu , 2012 ) . When looked for , such modifier variation is routinely observed; in model organisms , this phenomenon is recognized as genetic background effects ( Chandler et al . , 2013 ) . Genetic background effects are an example of cryptic genetic variation ( CGV ) , the class of mutations that affect phenotype under rare conditions ( Gibson and Dworkin , 2004; Paaby and Rockman , 2014 ) . Unlike mutations that are always silent with respect to phenotype , or mutations that always affect phenotype , CGV is invisible until a perturbation changes the molecular , cellular , or developmental processes that govern its phenotypic expression . In addition to genetic perturbations , CGV may be ‘released’ by environmental exposure , like the modern changes to diet that have been hypothesized to underlie the emergence of complex metabolic diseases in humans ( Gibson , 2009 ) . The concept of CGV has been of longstanding interest to evolutionary theorists because it explains how populations might store alleles that enable adaptation when conditions change ( Dobzhansky , 1941; Waddington , 1956; McGuigan et al . , 2011 ) , but its extent , architecture , and role in nature is largely unknown . Most of our empirical knowledge of CGV arises from studies that inhibited the heat shock chaperone protein HSP90 to reveal previously-silent mutational effects across many taxa , which probably represents a general mechanism that buffers genome-wide functional variation ( Queitsch et al . , 2002; Yeyati et al . , 2007; Jarosz and Lindquist , 2010; Chen and Wagner , 2012; Rohner et al . , 2013 ) . In this study , we aimed to systematically uncover and characterize genome-wide variation affecting a major metazoan process . C . elegans embryogenesis is both complex and typically invariant , which may favor the accumulation of mutations that act in a conditionally-functional manner ( Gibson and Dworkin , 2004; Paaby and Rockman , 2014 ) . We revealed these alleles by perturbing known embryonic genes and measuring differences in penetrance across multiple wild-derived strains . 2 Results To uncover the nature and extent of natural genetic modifiers in C . elegans embryogenesis , we individually targeted 29 maternal-effect genes in each of 55 wild strains from around the globe ( Figure 1 ) . Worms were grown in liquid culture in 96-well plates , and RNAi was delivered by feeding the parental generation Escherichia coli expressing dsRNA against the target genes ( Cipriani and Piano , 2011 ) . Each combination of strain and targeted gene was replicated in at least eight wells , and within each well an average of 10 adult worms contributed hundreds of offspring that were screened as dead or alive . Estimates of embryonic lethality were extracted by the image analysis algorithm DevStaR , which was developed to recognize C . elegans developmental stages for this specific application ( White et al . , 2013 ) . We then modeled the probability that an embryo would fail to develop as a function of targeted gene , worm strain , strain-by-gene interaction , and several experimental variables ( see ‘Materials and methods’ ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 09178 . 003Figure 1 . Experimental scheme and methods . ( A ) Under ordinary conditions , wild-type Caenorhabditis elegans embryos hatch into larvae . ( B ) We targeted maternally-expressed genes by RNAi to induce embryonic lethality that varied in penetrance across strains . ( C ) L1 larvae in the parental generation were fed Escherichia coli expressing dsRNA against target genes , in 96-well plates in liquid media . 5 days later , wells were imaged to capture the penetrance of embryonic lethality in the next generation . ( D , E ) Raw images were evaluated using DevStaR ( White et al . , 2013 ) , which identified objects as larvae ( blue ) , dead embryos ( green ) , or adults ( red ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 09178 . 003 The experiments revealed extensive variation in embryonic lethality caused by genetic differences among strains ( Figure 2 ) . We observed substantial variation among strains , with some strains exhibiting more embryonic lethality across all targeted genes than other strains , but also significant gene-specific among-strain variation , where particular combinations of gene and strain exhibited surprisingly high or low lethality ( Table 1 ) . These two classes of variation represent two general mechanisms of modifier action . Informational modifiers ( such as suppressors of nonsense mutations in classical screens [e . g . , Hodgkin et al . , 1989] , and modifiers of germline RNAi sensitivity in this experiment ) alter the effect of the initial perturbation in a non-gene-specific manner , while gene-specific modifiers reveal functional features of the targeted locus . By screening for modifiers of many different perturbations , we are able to quantitatively partition the effects of these mechanisms . Of the variation attributable to heritable modifier variation among worms , half is explained by non-gene-specific informational modifiers and half by gene-specific modifier effects ( Table 1 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 09178 . 004Figure 2 .

All terms were highly significant , including the strain-by-gene interaction , which represents variation attributable to cryptic genetic modifiers that act gene-specifically . This term and the strain term , which represents variation attributable to informational modifiers affecting germline RNAi , explain similar amounts of variation , and together account for 31% of the total deviance . The variation in embryonic lethality attributable to informational modifiers , represented by genetic strain effect in our statistical model , provides an estimate of each strain's sensitivity to exogenous germline RNAi . We observed dramatic variation in sensitivity . Most strains exhibited moderately reduced lethality penetrance relative to the RNAi-sensitive laboratory strain N2 , but two strains , the germline RNAi-insensitive strain CB4856 ( Tijsterman et al . , 2002 ) and the genetically divergent strain QX1211 , showed consistently weak penetrance across the targeted genes ( Figure 2 ) . CB4856 harbors a ppw-1 loss-of-function mutation that confers resistance to germline RNAi ( Tijsterman et al . , 2002 ) , but sequencing shows that QX1211 and other strains with intermediate sensitivity do not . We found that a ppw-1 mutation in the N2 background was more sensitive than CB4856 , showing high lethality on mex-3 and pos-1 ( Figure 2 ) , indicating that some of the difference between N2 and CB4856 is ppw-1-independent . These results demonstrate that insensitivity to germline RNAi is genetically complex and that wild C . elegans populations harbor many alleles affecting germline RNAi ( Elvin et al . , 2011; Pollard and Rockman , 2013 ) . Genetic modifiers of RNAi efficacy in our experiment may affect uptake of dsRNA , general RNAi machinery , or tissue-specific RNAi requirements . To distinguish among these , we targeted tubulin ( tba-2 ) , which is expressed ubiquitously . Among wild-type strains , all but four ( KR314 , JU396 , CB4852 and ED3040 ) showed complete sensitivity to somatic RNAi , indicated by developmental arrest of P0 animals on tba-2 , which demonstrates that most wild-type strains take up dsRNA and are capable of RNAi . An rrf-1 deletion mutant , which is sensitive to RNAi against genes expressed in the germline but resistant to RNAi in most somatic tissues ( Yigit et al . , 2006; Kumsta and Hansen , 2012 ) , grew to adulthood but laid dead embryos , suggesting that germline RNAi successfully silenced maternal tba-2 required for embryonic development . The four somatically-resistant wild strains also exhibited embryonic lethality on tba-2 and other germline-expressed genes , confirming that the modifier variability acts tissue-specifically . Gene-specific modifiers explain as much of the total variation as the informational modifiers , as estimated by the strain-by-gene interaction term in our model ( Table 1 ) , and represent cryptic genetic variation in developmental processes . The modifiers could act via network bypasses , where loss of the targeted gene reveals variation among strains in developmental network structure ( e . g . , Zhang and Emmons , 2000 ) . Gene-specific modifiers could also act on the extent of the knockdown at a gene-specific level , in a manner akin to intragenic suppressors , resulting in variable residual activity of the targeted gene . This latter class potentially includes gene-specific variation in RNAi sensitivity , perhaps due to heritable variation in transcriptional licensing ( Shirayama et al . , 2012; Seth et al . , 2013 ) , and variation in wild-type expression level of the targeted gene , due to cis- or trans-acting regulatory variation . Each of the 29 genes we targeted showed significant strain-by-gene interaction coefficients , indicating that genetic modifiers of embryonic gene perturbations are pervasive in natural populations . The coefficients , which are statistical estimates of the gene-specific cryptic phenotypes ( see ‘Materials and methods’ ) , exhibit low correlations between gene perturbations known to share function: 36 gene pairs have known physical or genetic interactions , but these did not show significantly elevated phenotypic correlations ( χ2 = 2 . 30 , df = 1 , p = 0 . 13 ) . For example , despite high interaction within the par network , which underlies polarization of the zygote , the average pairwise par gene correlation was no higher than the average correlation across all genes ( Supplementary file 1 ) . Coefficients for par-3 and par-6 were correlated ( correlation = 0 . 40 , p = 0 . 003 ) , but not for par-3 and pkc-3 ( correlation = −0 . 17 , p = 0 . 24 ) or par-6 and pkc-3 ( correlation = 0 . 12 , p = 0 . 41 ) , even though their proteins together comprise the anterior polarity complex ( Munro et al . , 2004 ) . This indicates that the cryptic genetic modifiers have low developmental pleiotropy ( Paaby and Rockman , 2013 ) . That is , variation at these loci must influence a very restricted suite of developmental events , since only specific perturbations uncover evidence of their phenotypic effects . For those associated with polarization of the zygote , this may be explained by the high degree of redundancy observed in the process ( Beatty et al . , 2010; Fievet et al . , 2013; Motegi and Seydoux , 2013 ) , as redundancy allows shared function of some factors and specificity of others . Exceptions to the overall trend of low correlation between gene perturbations are discussed below , in the context of genome-wide associations . The low pleiotropy of cryptic alleles may be a result of purifying selection , which over evolutionary time should deplete populations of pleiotropic alleles as they may be more likely to be deleterious ( Stern , 2000 ) . Our quantitative-genetic approach is uniquely able to discern modifier effects that depend simultaneously on variants at many loci . In order to evaluate the polygenicity of the gene-specific variation we observed , and to ask whether cryptic alleles are rare or common in populations , we assessed whether genome-wide genetic similarity among strains explained patterns of phenotypic similarity ( Kang et al . , 2008 ) . Specifically , we estimated the genomic heritability of the strain-by-gene coefficients . This approach estimates the proportion of gene-specific modifier effects caused by alleles of intermediate frequency at many loci , as these are best captured in estimates of strain relatedness . We found that for most of the perturbations , variation in lethality penetrance is due to common alleles at many contributing cryptic loci . Of the 29 genes we targeted , 12 exhibited gene-specific modifier variation with genomic heritability estimates greater than 0 . 80; for 19 genes , estimates were greater than 0 . 60 ( Table 2 ) . However , genotypic similarity failed to explain phenotypic similarity for perturbations of emb-30 , mel-32 , mex-3 , mom-5 , par-3 and sur-6 ( Table 2 ) . Because these genes exhibit nonzero variance in their associated strain-by-gene interaction coefficients , the strains necessarily harbor cryptic genetic differences affecting lethality under these perturbations . Thus , the genetic architecture of the cryptic variation associated with these genes is likely comprised of few loci , rarer alleles , or both . 10 . 7554/eLife . 09178 . 006Table 2 .

GWA in C . elegans benefits from high linkage disequilibrium in this species , which reduces the number of tests required to scan the genome , and from high biological replication , which reduces the number of required genotypes relative to human GWA ( Rockman and Kruglyak , 2009; Andersen et al . , 2012 ) . Nine of the 29 analyses identified at least one single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) associated with phenotype under a strict Bonferroni-corrected threshold for significance ( Supplementary file 2 ) . Across all tests , a total of 19 SNPs or SNP haplotype blocks , defined by SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium ( R2 > 0 . 9 ) , exhibited significant associations at that threshold ( Supplementary file 2 ) , while many additional variants exhibit suggestive associations ( p < 0 . 001 ) . To validate the GWA findings , we introgressed a segment of chromosome II from strain N2 into the genome of wild isolate EG4348 . Gene-specific modifier phenotypes for lsy-22 and pkc-3 both have suggestive associations with SNPs on the right arm of chromosome II ( the SNPs for lsy-22 are independent of those for pkc-3 [R2 = 0 . 03] , which reside approximately a megabase away , implicating distinct cryptic modifiers ) . N2 exhibits low lethality when lsy-22 is targeted but high lethality on pkc-3 , and EG4348 shows the opposite pattern; in both comparisons , the introgression rescued the original N2 phenotype ( Figure 3 ) . These results demonstrate that cryptic variants within the introgression modify the effects of lsy-22 and pkc-3 perturbations . 10 . 7554/eLife . 09178 . 007Figure 3 . Tests for gene-specific modifiers . Introgression of part of chromosome II from strain N2 ( yellow ) into strain EG4348 ( blue ) rescues the N2 phenotype on lsy-22 ( F = 12 . 15 , DF = 2 , p = 0 . 001 ) and pkc-3 ( F = 55 . 87 , DF = 2 , p < 0 . 001 ) ; genome-wide analyses found associations between this region and hatching phenotypes for both lsy-22 and pkc-3 .

In the data file , the strain QG611 has the N2 genetic background . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 09178 . 008 To distinguish between intragenic and extragenic modifiers , we considered the list of 129 associated SNPs ( in 27 haplotype blocks ) with p-values less than 10−4 ( Supplementary file 2 ) , all of which exceed the significance of the validated lsy-22 and pkc-3 modifiers . These associations were spread across 15 targeted-gene phenotypes . No SNPs lie within or near the locus of the targeted gene , with the exception of one SNP within the mel-28 locus that associates with the mel-28 phenotype . The mel-28 phenotype is also associated with multiple other SNPs elsewhere in the genome . Thus , most of the CGV detectable by GWA is caused by extragenic modifiers . Extragenic modifiers may work by affecting , in trans , the expression level of the targeted gene . Recent work shows that differences in severity of RNAi phenotype , for four C . elegans strains perturbed at electron transport chain genes , are associated with differences in expression level of the targeted gene ( Vu et al . , 2015 ) . However , we find no evidence for the reported pattern of lower expression explaining more severe phenotypes . We examined published transcript abundances for our 29 target genes measured in 4-cell embryos ( Grishkevich et al . , 2012 ) under standard conditions in five strains . Five of the genes exhibited significant variation in expression among the strains . In contrast , RNAi against 28 induced significant gene-specific variation in embryonic lethality among the five strains . Overall , both for genes with significant variation and for the whole set , lower expression of the target gene was usually correlated with less severe RNAi phenotypes ( 20 of 29 genes , p = 0 . 06 ) , though the correlations are weak . Although undetectable differences in transcript level may nevertheless contribute to embryonic survival , these results suggest that much of the gene-specific modifier effect we observe depends on variation beyond the target gene . Our GWA mapping identified few SNPs associated with more than one phenotype . For example , lethality phenotypes for 4 of the 7 targeted polarity genes ( par-2 , -4 , -6 and pkc-3 ) were associated with SNPs , but none were shared . The discrete nature of the genotype–phenotype associations further implies low developmental pleiotropy of the cryptic alleles; variants with effects under one perturbation have no detectable effects under another . However , the rare instances of multiple associations for individual SNPs implicate a relationship between the targeted genes ( Supplementary file 2 ) . The co-association of SNPs in a haplotype block on chromosome IV with lethality phenotypes for rpn-9 and rpn-10 support a known relationship , as rpn-9 and rpn-10 both encode non-ATPase regulatory subunits of the proteasome and are predicted to interact with each other ( Zhong and Sternberg , 2006; Lee et al . , 2008 ) . The haplotype , which spans approximately 10 kb , was also significantly associated with lethality phenotypes for car-1 , mom-5 , and skn-1; skn-1 has a role in proteasome-mediated protein homeostasis ( Li et al . , 2011 ) . Separately , modifier phenotypes for pkc-3 , involved in anterior-posterior polarity in the early embryo , and rfc-3 , which shows homology to DNA replication factors C and effects on cell cycle synchrony ( Piano et al . , 2002 ) , are associated with SNPs on both chromosome III and X . Because the co-associations occur twice , with unlinked SNPs ( R2 = 0 . 26 ) , they implicate the presence of at least two interacting cryptic alleles and provide independent lines of evidence for a relationship between pkc-3 and rfc-3 , genes with no reported interactions or shared functions . 3 Discussion We have uncovered pervasive CGV that modifies the probability that an embryo will survive a gene perturbation . By evaluating the effects of naturally-occurring mutations on gene knockdowns , we explored a genotypic space that is distinct from that accessible to conventional screens . Our findings provide complementary insight , including discovery of modifier activity that may be detectable only when effects are moderate ( Fievet et al . , 2013 ) or polygenic ( Mackay , 2014 ) . We describe the variation we uncovered as ‘cryptic’ because its effect on embryonic survival is dramatically magnified under perturbed conditions . Without gene perturbation , our strains exhibit little embryonic lethality . However , under ordinary conditions the strains vary in gene expression and other cellular or developmental phenotypes ( Grishkevich et al . , 2012; Farhadifar et al . , 2015 ) , which may be the mechanisms by which the cryptic alleles influence the penetrance of the primary perturbation . Previously , we and others have described such differences as variation in ‘intermediate’ phenotypes ( Félix and Wagner , 2008; Paaby and Rockman , 2014 ) ; whether a genetic variant is cryptic requires definition of the focal phenotype , since even at the morphological level an allele can be cryptic in one trait but penetrant in another ( Duveau and Félix , 2012 ) . Exploration of CGV is not new: CGV has been demonstrated following perturbation of candidate genes ( Gibson and Hogness , 1996; Dworkin et al . , 2003; Cassidy et al . , 2013; Chandler et al . , 2013; Chari and Dworkin , 2013 ) ; its potential role in adaptive evolution has been considered in diverse systems ( Dobzhansky , 1941; Waddington , 1953; Masel , 2006; Ledon-Rettig et al . , 2010; McGuigan et al . , 2011; Duveau and Félix , 2012; Rohner et al . , 2013 ) ; and most extensively , it has been characterized following inhibition of HSP90 ( Rutherford and Lindquist , 1998; Queitsch et al . , 2002; Yeyati et al . , 2007; Jarosz and Lindquist , 2010 ) . Here , we show by systematic evaluation that the phenomenon of conditionally functional variation pervades even the highly stereotyped and controlled process of embryogenesis . We found that gene-specific cryptic variation affects every targeted gene , implying that wild populations harbor many enhancers and suppressors of critical embryonic genes . In humans , such penetrance modifiers may mediate expression of genetic diseases arising from loss-of-function mutations ( Abecasis et al . , 2010; Hamilton and Yu , 2012; MacArthur et al . , 2012 ) , and if their crypsis is environmentally influenced they may also explain modern disease susceptibility ( Gibson , 2009 ) . Our screen also revealed dramatic variation among wild-type strains in their responses to exogenous RNAi in the germline . Somatic RNAi response has been shown to influence C . elegans susceptibility to viral infection; variation in germline RNAi may affect vertical viral transmissibility ( Félix et al . , 2011 ) as well as transposon activity ( Sijen and Plasterk , 2003; Vastenhouw and Plasterk , 2004 ) . The variation we describe illustrates how conditionally-functional relationships between genes may pervade the variation on which natural selection acts , affecting how complex traits evolve ( True and Haag , 2001; Félix , 2007; Wang and Sommer , 2011; Verster et al . , 2014 ) and the nature of their genetic architecture ( Mackay , 2014 ) . Moreover , this variation has major implications for model system biologists that work with a single genetic strain . 4 Materials and methods We evaluated laboratory strain N2 , originally derived from Bristol , England , and 54 wild-type strains derived from populations around the world . The wild-type strains were chosen with reference to genotype data ( Rockman and Kruglyak , 2009; Andersen et al . , 2012 ) ; we avoided haplotype-identical isolates , which can occur even across disparate sampling locations , and included the most diverged genotypes at the population level . The wild-type strains were: AB1 , AB2 ( Adelaide , Australia ) , CB3197 , PS2025 ( Altadena , CA , USA ) , CB3198 ( Pasadena , CA , USA ) , CB4852 ( Rothamsted , England ) , CB4856 ( Hawaii , USA ) , CB4857 ( Claremont , CA , USA ) , CB4932 ( Taunton , England ) , ED3010 , ED3017 , ED3021 ( Edinburgh , Scotland ) , ED3040 ( Johannesburg , South Africa ) , ED3042 , ED3046 ( Western Cape , South Africa ) , ED3073 ( Limuru , Kenya ) , EG4347 , EG4348 , EG4945 , EG4951 ( Salt Lake City , UT , USA ) , EG4724 ( Amares , Portugal ) , JU1088 ( Japan ) , JU1171 , JU1172 ( Chile ) , JU258 ( Madeira , Portugal ) , JU301 ( LeBlanc , France ) , JU319 , JU347 ( Merlet , France ) , JU362 , JU366 , JU371 , JU694 ( Franconville , France ) , JU396 , JU398 , JU399 , JU406 ( Hermanville , France ) , JU440 ( Beauchene , France ) , JU533 ( Primel , France ) , JU563 ( Sainte Barbe , France ) , JU642 ( Le Perreux , France ) , KR314 ( Vancouver , Canada ) , LKC34 ( Madagascar ) , MY1 ( Lingen , Germany ) , MY14 , MY15 , MY16 ( Mecklenbeck , Germany ) , MY18 , MY21 ( Roxel , Germany ) , PB303 ( isolated from an isopod from Ward's Biological Supply ) , PB306 ( isolated from an isopod from Connecticut Valley Biological Supply ) , PX174 ( Lincoln City , OR , USA ) , PX179 ( Eugene , OR , USA ) , QX1211 ( San Francisco , CA , USA ) , and QX1218 ( Berkeley , CA , USA ) . Isolates were acquired from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center or kindly shared by members in the worm community . We also assayed N2 mutants NL2557 , which carries a deletion at ppw-1 ( pk1425 ) that confers resistance to RNAi in the germline ( Tijsterman et al . , 2002 ) , and NL2098 , which carries a deletion at rrf-1 ( pk1417 ) that confers resistance to RNAi in most somatic tissues ( Yigit et al . , 2006; Kumsta and Hansen , 2012 ) . These were provided by the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center , which is funded by NIH Office of Research Infrastructure Programs ( P40 OD010440 ) . Worms were grown to large numbers on agarose-media plates , and healthy embryos at least two generations past starvation or thawing were collected using standard bleaching techniques . For each strain , ∼10 , 000 embryos were plated onto a 15 cm agarose-media plate densely seeded with E . coli OP50 . Worms were reared at 20°C with food until gravid , then bleached and the embryos synchronized to the arrested L1 larval stage by rocking in M9 buffer overnight at 20°C . Following the methodology for growing and imaging worms in 96-well plates described in ref . 27 , larvae were washed and diluted to 10 worms per 20 μl of S buffer with additives . Worms were dispensed with a peristaltic pump ( Matrix Wellmate ) in 20 μl volumes into wells of flat-bottomed 96-well plates ( in rows , 8 strains per plate ) already containing 30 μl of the appropriate RNAi feeding bacteria . Each plate was replicated eight times , and N2 was dispensed on every plate . After dispensing , plates were stored at 20°C in sealed humid chambers for 5 days . Three sets of eight worm strains were dispensed per experimental cycle; we performed a total of three cycles over 3 months . In our initial survey , we targeted 41 germline-expressed genes and one somatic gene ( tba-2 ) . The germline-expressed genes were chosen following exploratory examination of a larger set of embryonic genes for which observations of embryonic lethality phenotypes were reported on wormbase . org . The final set of 41 were selected by eliminating genes with effects on post-embryonic development or sterility , by including genes with a range of lethality penetrance in N2 , and by including the seven core members of the par pathway . We targeted the genes by feeding the worms HT115 E . coli bacteria expressing dsRNA for their targets . Bacteria had been transformed with pL4440-derived RNAi feeding vectors into which target DNA had been cloned ( Timmons et al . , 2001 ) and which carry genes for ampicillin and tetracycline resistance . We also included E . coli carrying the empty pL4440 vector , for a total of 43 RNAi vectors in the survey . The majority of the RNAi vectors we used were obtained from the Ahringer feeding library ( Kamath and Ahringer , 2003 ) . These included: aph-1 ( VF36H2L . 1 ) , car-1 ( Y18D10A . 17 ) , cdc-37 ( W08F4 . 8 ) , cdc-42 ( R07G3 . 1 ) , ceh-18 ( ZC64 . 3 ) , cyb-2 . 1 ( Y43E12A . 1 ) , emb-30 ( F54C8 . 3 ) , fat-2 ( W02A2 . 1 ) , gad-1 ( T05H4 . 14 ) , lag-1 ( K08B4 . 1 ) , lin-5 ( T09A5 . 10 ) , lsy-22 ( F27D4 . 2 ) , mel-26 ( ZK858 . 4 ) , mel-28 ( C38D4 . 3 ) , mel-32 ( C05D11 . 11 ) , mes-1 ( F54F7 . 5 ) , mex-3 ( F53G12 . 5 ) , mom-2 ( F38E1 . 7 ) , mom-5 ( T23D8 . 1 ) , nmy-2 ( F20G4 . 3 ) , nos-3 ( Y53C12B . 3 ) , ooc-3 ( B0334 . 11 ) , par-1 ( H39E23 . 1 ) , par-2 ( F58B6 . 3 ) , par-3 ( F54E7 . 3 ) , par-5 ( M117 . 2 ) , par-6 ( T26E3 . 3 ) , pkc-3 ( F09E5 . 1 ) , pos-1 ( F52E1 . 1 ) , rfc-3 ( C39E9 . 13 ) , rpn-10 ( B0205 . 3 ) , rpn-12 ( ZK20 . 5 ) , rpn-9 ( T06D8 . 8 ) , skn-1 ( T19E7 . 2 ) , skr-2 ( F46A9 . 4 ) , spat-1 ( F57C2 . 6 ) , spat-2 ( Y48A6B . 13 ) , sur-6 ( F26E4 . 1 ) , tba-2 ( C47B2 . 3 ) , and ztf-1 ( F54F2 . 5 ) . We also used two feeding vectors created and kindly shared by M . Mana , for genes gpb-1 ( F13D12 . 7 ) and par-4 ( Y59A8B . 14 ) . We constructed a frozen RNAi bacterial feeding library in 96-well plates with 20% glycerol . The bacteria were distributed across the plates in columns ( 12 vectors per plate ) ; the mom-2 vector was included on every plate . Using a 96-pin replicator , bacterial colonies were transferred from the frozen libraries and grown on LB agar plates ( 100 μg/ml ampicillin , 12 μg/ml tetracyclin ) . LB broth ( 50 μg/ml ampicillin ) in 96-deep-well plates was inoculated from the solid cultures using the pin replicator and grown overnight in a 37°C shaker . Cultures were induced with 1 mM IPTG for two hours and dispensed into 96-well flat-bottom plates using a Tecan Aquarius robot . Although we evaluated 41 genes in our experiment , in our final analysis we included results only for 29 . Perturbing gpb-1 and lin-5 induced growth defects in multiple strains such that the parental generation of worms failed to develop to reproductive maturity , indicating that these genes have effects outside of embryogenesis . We also identified ten genes ( ceh-18 , cyb-2 . 1 , gad-1 , mes-1 , ooc-3 , nos-3 , rpn-12 , spat-1 , spat-2 and ztf-1 ) that induced no or extremely low embryonic lethality . As they were indistinguishable from the empty vector negative control , we excluded them from analysis . 5 days after the experimental cycle was initiated , the L1 larvae had developed into egg-laying adults and consumed the RNAi bacteria so that the wells were optically clear . Wells were photographed at the point at which viable embryos had hatched but not developed past early larval stages . We captured single images of each well using a DFC340 FX camera and a Z16 dissecting microscope ( Leica Microsystems , Inc . , Buffalo Grove , IL ) , a Bio-precision motorized stage with adaptors for the 96-well plates and stage fittings ( Ludl , Inc . , Hawthorne , NY ) , and Surveyor software from Media Cybernetics , Inc . ( Warrendale , PA ) . We used a 1 . 2 ms exposure at 17 . 3× magnification . Data were extracted from the images using the automated image analysis system DevStaR ( White et al . , 2013 ) . DevStaR is an object recognition machine that classifies each object in the image as an adult , larva or embryo using a support vector machine and global shape recognition . Embryonic lethality estimates were derived from the proportion of embryos in each well relative to all progeny ( embryos plus larvae ) . During the development of DevStaR , each of the approximately 30 , 000 images in this experiment were manually evaluated and assigned qualitative scores for the number of embryos and the number of larvae , and exact counts were determined for the adults in each well . These data provided independent phenotype estimates and demonstrate that DevStaR is accurate and reliable ( White et al . , 2013 ) , and we used the manually-collected adult count data in our analyses evaluating the number of adults in each well . The counts of dead embryos and living larvae from each experimental well were bound together as a single response variable and modeled using a generalized linear model with a quasi-binomial error structure . In the central analysis , in which we evaluated 55 strains and 29 genes , the model included main effects of strain , targeted gene , number of adult worms per well , and experimental date; and interaction terms for strain-by-gene , strain-by-adults and gene-by-adults , in the form:E ( Y ) =g−1 ( β0+βStrainXStrain+βGeneXGene+βAdultsXAdults+βDateXDate+βStrain*GeneXStrainXGene+βStrain*AdultsXStrainXAdults+βGene*AdultsXGeneXAdults ) where g−1 represents a logit link function . The analysis was conducted using the glm function in R Development Core Team ( 2010 ) and model fit was examined with the deviance statistic . Coefficients from the strain-by-gene interaction term in this model were used as estimates of gene-specific CGV , as they provide quantitative measures of probability of embryonic lethality associated with each perturbation after accounting for contributions from the general degree of lethality of the perturbation , the strain effect associated with variation in informational modifiers affecting germline RNAi , and other experimental variables . The significance of each coefficient was computed by assessing the coefficient ratio against the t-distribution using the summary . glm function . We also performed a mixed-model analysis using the glmer function in the R package lme4 ( Bates , 2010 ) with a logit link function and a binomial error structure , in which all effects except the number of adults were specified as random . Results from this analysis were consistent with the fixed-effects analysis , including tight correlation between the fixed-effect coefficients and the mixed-effect estimates and between the downstream GWAS results; we only report results from the fixed-effects analysis . Other analyses , including those exploring confounding effects of experimental design , fitted models with additional terms for well position and bacterial source to subsets of the data . To identify best-fitting models , terms were sequentially reduced from the full model and model comparison was achieved with the F statistic . Correlations among gene perturbations were estimated using the Spearman Rank method in R . The coefficients , extracted from the generalized linear model , for each strain on each targeted gene were compared for each pairwise combination of genes . Evidence for known interactions among pairs of genes was collated from wormbase . org ( February 2015 ) and includes physical and genetic interactions . We tested whether gene pairs with known interactions had higher phenotypic correlations using the Kruskal–Wallis method in R . Because we arranged worm strains in fixed rows and RNAi vectors in fixed columns across the 96-well experimental plates , well position was a potentially confounding source of variation in the data . The source of each bacterial culture was also potentially confounding , as each culture was grown independently for each strain on a plate . To estimate the contribution of these variables to the lethality phenotypes , we examined hatching variation for strain N2 on targeted gene mom-2 , which we included in every plate . The dataset includes counts of dead and alive offspring from 285 experimental wells . Independent cultures of E . coli bacteria expressing dsRNA against mom-2 only weakly affected hatching ( F = 3 . 12 , DF = 2 , p = 0 . 046 ) ( Table 3 ) , and whether a well was on the edge , near the edge , or in the center of the plate had no effect on phenotype ( F = 1 . 39 , DF = 2 , p = 0 . 251 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 09178 . 009Table 3 .

To evaluate the relative importance of date , we examined the N2 lethality phenotypes for all 29 lethality-inducing genes across the three dates . While the date effect was statistically significant , it explained only 1 . 9% of the deviance; the gene effect explained 86 . 6% of the deviance ( Table 4 ) . The model that best fits the data also includes main and interaction terms for the number of adults per well , but their effects are similarly negligible . 10 . 7554/eLife . 09178 . 010Table 4 .

ML . LRT function in the R package emma , which controls for population structure using a kinship matrix and performs efficient mixed-model association using maximum likelihood ( Kang et al . , 2008 ) . The kinship matrix was determined from a total of 41 , 188 SNPs across 53 strains; we excluded strains CB4856 and QX1211 , as they are essentially insensitive to RNAi in the germline . The SNP genotypes are as described in Andersen et al . ( 2012 ) and were downloaded from the website of E Andersen ( http://groups . molbiosci . northwestern . edu/andersen/Data . html ) . We assayed six wild isolates not fully genotyped by that study; see our imputation method below . The phenotype values were the coefficients estimated from the strain-by-gene interaction by the generalized linear model , as they include strain contributions to lethality minus the strain effect , the date effect , and other effects of experimental design . We evaluated SNPs with minor allele counts of 6 or more , which allowed us to interrogate 9362 SNPs . Of these , 3057 exhibit unique genotype identities across the 53 strains , and the strict threshold for significance , following Bonferroni correction for multiple tests , was determined at 0 . 05/3 , 057 , or 1 . 6 × 10−5 . Genomic heritability estimates for each of the cryptic phenotypes represented by the strain-by-gene coefficients was determined from the genetic and residual error variance components estimated by restricted maximum likelihood , using the function emma . REMLE . Significance was tested by 1000 permutations of strain phenotypes . Six wild isolates in our study were not fully genotyped using the RAD-seq method by Andersen et al . ( 2012 ) , and we used the following procedure to impute genotypes at the full set of SNPs . If the strain was identical at the 1454 SNPs assayed by Rockman and Kruglyak ( 2009 ) to a strain genotyped by RAD-seq , we used the RAD-seq data of the matching strain . This allowed us to use genotype data of CB4854 for CB3197; JU310 for JU301; JU311 for JU319; JU367 for JU371 , and MY10 for MY21 . In each of these cases , multiple RAD-sequenced strains collapse into groups of strains that are also identical at the 1454 SNPs , suggesting that this procedure is reliable . Only in the case of JU366 do we encounter uncertainty . At the 1454 SNP markers , this strain is identical to JU360 , JU363 , and JU368 ( and three others not RAD-sequenced ) . JU360 and JU368 have identical RAD-seq haplotypes , but JU363 is different at 224 sites ( of which 164 were tested for association with phenotype ) . We substituted both JU360 and JU363 as proxies for JU366 and ran the full GWAS pipeline twice; the differences in outcome were negligible , with extremely tight correlation among SNP p-values across all tests and no differences in the set of statistically significant SNPs . We created the strain QG611 , which carries two markers ( mIs12 , expressing GFP in the pharynx , and juIs76 , expressing GFP in the motor neurons ) in the N2 wild-type background . The markers are positioned at the approximate middle and right end of chromosome II , respectively ( precise locations are unknown ) , which flank the region for which lsy-22 and pkc-3 phenotypes were associated . We crossed QG611 to wild-type strain EG4348 and then backcrossed to EG4348 for 20 generations , retaining the N2 introgression by selecting for the double markers . The introgression strain , QG1438 , carries the N2 haplotype from approximately II 3 , 174 , 000 to the right of II 14 , 430 , 751 . To test the effect of the introgression on lsy-22 and pkc-3 perturbations , RNAi was induced by feeding on agarose plates following standard protocols ( wormbook . org ) : test worms were singled onto plates , 6 replicates each , at the L4 stage following bleaching and developmental synchronization; worms were transferred daily for 3 days and the number of dead embryos and hatched larvae were counted 24 hr after transfer . Test strains included QG611 ( the GFP constructs in QG611 have no effect on phenotype relative to N2 , data not shown ) , EG4348 , and QG1438 . The data were analyzed using a generalized linear model with a quasi-binomial error structure to test the effect of strain on embryonic lethality . Seventeen strains ( AB1 , AB2 , CB3198 , CB4852 , CB4856 , EG4347 , EG4348 , JU319 , JU371 , JU1088 , JU1171 , MY1 , MY16 , MY18 , PB306 , PX174 , PX179 ) were examined for sequence variation at the RNAi target sites . Sequences were derived from 100-bp paired-end reads run on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 that were mapped to the N2 reference ( ce10 ) using stampy ( Lunter and Goodson , 2011 ) and variant-called with samtools ( Li et al . , 2009 ) . We observed nucleotide variation in these genes , but zero mutations in the exons targeted by the RNAi clones we used . Thus , we exclude RNAi mismatch via target locus sequence variation as a source of the phenotypic variation we observed . Off-target predictions for our RNAi clones were generated from a sliding window analysis of matching 21-mers between the RNAi reagent and the C . elegans reference genome ( ce10 ) . We predicted no off-target sequence matches for the 29 clones used in our final analysis . To test whether native gene expression of our target genes correlates with the embryonic lethality phenotypes , we downloaded microarray transcriptome data published by Grishkevich et al . ( 2012 ) . These data were collected on 4-cell embryos , which retain the maternally-inherited mRNA transcripts that were the targets of our study , and include three replicate values ( following quantile normalization and log10 transformation ) determined from three pools of 50 embryos each . We examined gene expression values for the 29 targeted genes , collected under control conditions , for five strains: AB2 , CB4856 , CB4857 , N2 , and RC301 ( identical to PX174 , which we tested in our study ) . We tested for the genotypic effect of strain with an ANOVA and for correlations between the transcriptome data and our estimates of gene-specific CGV using the Spearman Rank method . For each gene , we looked for correlation between the average gene expression value for each of the five strains and the strain coefficients from the strain-by-gene interaction term in our statistical analysis . We used the same generalized linear model structure as described above; in this analysis , we included 29 genes and five strains . We used a two-tailed binomial sign test to assess whether the 29 correlations were disproportionately positive or negative ."}

In addition , integration of TCRβ sequence patterns into a hepatitis B epitope-specific annotation model can predict which individuals will have an early and more vigorous vaccine-elicited immunity . Thus , the presence of preexisting memory T cell clonotypes has a significant impact on immunity and can be used to predict immune responses to vaccination .", "plain language summary": "Immune cells called CD4 T cells help the body build immunity to infections caused by bacteria and viruses , or after vaccination . Receptor proteins on the outside of the cells recognize pathogens , foreign molecules called antigens , or vaccine antigens . Vaccine antigens are usually inactivated bacteria or viruses , or fragments of these pathogens . After recognizing an antigen , CD4 T cells develop into memory CD4 T cells ready to defend against future infections with the pathogen . People who have never been exposed to a pathogen , or have never been vaccinated against it , may nevertheless have preexisting memory cells ready to defend against it . This happens because CD4 T cells can recognize multiple targets , which enables the immune system to be ready to defend against both new and familiar pathogens . Elias , Meysman , Bartholomeus et al . wanted to find out whether having preexisting memory CD4 T cells confers an advantage for vaccine-induced immunity . Thirty-four people who were never exposed to hepatitis B or vaccinated against it participated in the study . These individuals provided blood samples before vaccination , with 2 doses of the hepatitis B vaccine , and at 3 time points afterward . Using next generation immune sequencing and machine learning techniques , Elias et al . analyzed the individuals’ memory CD4 T cells before and after vaccination . The experiments showed that preexisting memory CD4 T cells may determine vaccination outcomes , and people with more preexisting memory cells develop quicker and stronger immunity after vaccination against hepatitis B . This information may help scientists to better understand how people develop immunity to pathogens . It may guide them develop better vaccines or predict who will develop immunity after vaccination .", "article": "1 Introduction Antigen recognition through the T cell receptor ( TCR ) is one of the key determinants of the adaptive immune response ( Rudolph et al . , 2006 ) . Antigen presentation via major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) proteins , together with the right costimulatory and cytokine signals , are responsible for T cell activation ( Curtsinger and Mescher , 2010; Esensten et al . , 2016 ) . The TCR αβ heterodimer binds the peptide-MHC ( pMHC ) complex and confers the specificity of a T cell to an epitope . A highly diverse TCR repertoire ensures that an effective T cell response can be mounted against pathogen-derived peptides ( Turner et al . , 2009 ) . High TCRαβ diversity is generated through V ( D ) J recombination at the complementary-determining region 3 ( CDR3 ) of TCRα and TCRβ chains , accompanied with junctional deletions and insertions of nucleotides , further adding to the diversity ( Krangel , 2009 ) . Vaccines activate naïve T cells with high specificity to vaccine-derived peptides and induce T cell expansion and differentiation into effective and multifunctional T cells . This is followed by a contraction phase from which surviving cells constitute a long-lived memory T cell pool that allows for a quick and robust T cell response upon a second exposure to the pathogen ( Farber et al . , 2014 ) . However , previous studies have shown that a prior pathogen encounter is not a prerequisite for the formation of memory T cells and that CD4 T cells with a memory phenotype can be found in antigen-naïve individuals ( Su et al . , 2013 ) . The existence of memory-like CD4 T cells in naïve individuals ( Sewell , 2012 ) can be explained by molecular mimicry , as the encounter with environmentally derived peptides activates cross-reactive T cells due to the flexible nature of CD4 T cell recognition of the pMHC complex ( Wilson et al . , 2004 ) . Indeed , work that attempted to replicate the history of human pathogen exposure in mice has shown that sequential infections altered the immunological profile and remodeled the immune response to vaccination ( Reese et al . , 2016 ) . The existence of memory CD4 T cells specific to vaccine-derived peptides in unexposed individuals might confer an advantage in vaccine-induced immunity . In the present study , we used high-throughput sequencing to profile the memory CD4 TCRβ repertoire of healthy hepatitis B ( HB ) -naïve adults before and after administration of an HB vaccine to investigate the impact of preexisting memory CD4 T cells on the immune response to the vaccine . Based on anti-hepatitis B surface ( anti-HBs ) antibody titers over 365 days , vaccinees were grouped into early- , late- , and non-converters . Our data reveals that individuals with preexisting vaccine-specific CD4 T cell clonotypes in the memory CD4 compartment had earlier emergence of antibodies and mounted a more vigorous CD4 T cell response to the vaccine . Moreover , we identify a set of vaccine-specific TCRβ sequence patterns which can be used to predict TCR specificity and in turn , which individuals will have an early and more vigorous response to HB vaccine . 2 Results Out of 34 vaccinees , 21 vaccinees seroconverted ( an anti-HBs titer above 10 IU/ml was considered protective; Keating and Noble , 2003 ) at day 60 and were classified as early-converters; nine vaccinees seroconverted at day 180 or day 365 and were classified as late-converters; remaining four vaccinees had an anti-HBs antibody titer lower than 10 IU/ml at all time points following vaccination and were classified as non-converters ( Figure 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 1A ) . Members of Herpesviridae family might alter immune responses to vaccines ( Furman et al . , 2015 ) . We found no significant differences in cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) , Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) , or herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) seropositivity between the three groups in our cohort ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1B ) . Early-converters were slightly younger than late-converters , and non-converters were notably younger than both early- and late-converters ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1C ) . A genomic DNA-based TCRβ sequence dataset of memory CD4 T cells isolated from peripheral blood was generated from a cohort of 33 healthy vaccinees ( see Materials and methods for details ) right before vaccination ( day 0 ) and 60 days after administration of the first dose of HB vaccine ( 30 days after administration of the second vaccine dose ) . Between 4 . 54 × 104 and 3 . 92 × 105 productive TCRβ sequence reads were obtained for each vaccinee at each time point ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1A ) . Between 30 , 000 and 90 , 000 unique TCRβ sequences were sequenced for each vaccinee at each time point ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1B ) . As expected , considering the extremely diverse memory CD4 T cell repertoire ( Klarenbeek et al . , 2010 ) , less than 20% of the TCRβ sequences is shared between the time points for each vaccinee ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1C ) . The diversity of the memory CD4 T cell repertoire of each vaccinee at the two time points was explored , but neither the breadth of the memory CD4 TCRβ repertoire nor the Shannon equitability index was found to have been impacted by the vaccine at day 60 ( Figure 2A ) . Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from day 60 were labeled with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester ( CFSE ) , a dye that enables tracking of cell proliferation , and stimulated with a pool of peptides spanning HB surface antigen ( HBsAg ) . After day 7 of in vitro expansion , we sorted CFSElow CD4 T cells ( Becattini et al . , 2015 ) and extracted mRNA for quantitative assessment of HBsAg-specific TCRβ clonotypes by sequencing ( see Materials and methods for details ) . The establishment of a set of vaccine-specific TCRs enables their tracking within memory CD4 T cell repertoires from day 0 to day 60 , based on their CDR3β amino acid sequences . We detected a significant increase in the breadth of HBsAg-specific TCRβ sequences at day 60 post-vaccination compared to pre-vaccination ( mean increase = 107 . 9% , 95% CI = 62 . 2–358 . 5% ) ( Figure 2B and Figure 2—figure supplement 1D ) . This increase far exceeded a baseline control of varicella-zoster virus ( VZV ) -specific TCRβ sequences established in an identical manner ( mean difference = 2 . 1% , 95% CI = −6 . 6% to 12 . 4% ) . The HBsAg-specific increase was found to be significant when compared to this VZV baseline ( Wilcoxon p-value 6 . 3e-05 ) . When considered across the different groups , the increase was found to be significantly different from the VZV baseline for the early-converters ( mean = 151 . 9% , 95% CI = 78 . 9–342 . 0% , Wilcoxon Bonferroni-corrected p-value 8 . 64e-5 ) and non-converters ( mean = 67 . 6% , 95% CI: 37 . 6–89 . 7% , Wilcoxon Bonferroni-corrected p-value 0 . 03 ) , but not for the late-converters ( mean = 18 . 8% , 95% CI = 3 . 6–41 . 8% , Wilcoxon Bonferroni-corrected p-value 0 . 257 ) . As HBsAg-specific TCRβ sequences were already detected in the memory CD4 T cell repertoire prior to vaccination , we sought to determine whether the vaccination induced an expansion of those sequences . Based on the frequency of vaccine-specific TCRβ sequences within the memory CD4 T cell repertoire , the data does not support a vaccine-induced expansion of preexisting vaccine-specific TCRβ sequences ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1E ) . Thus , although we see a rise in vaccine-specific TCRβ T cells from day 0 to day 60 , this cannot be attributed to an expansion of the vaccine-specific TCRβ clonotypes found at day 0 but rather the recruitment of new TCRβ clonotypes , as visualized for one vaccinee in Figure 2C . It makes sense to not only look at the difference in vaccine-specific TCRβ sequences between time points , but also explore whether there are differences in the proportion of HBsAg-specific clones in the memory repertoire between early-converters , late-converters , and non-converters after vaccination . In this case , to allow for a between-vaccinees comparison ( in contrast to the within-vaccinees time point comparison ) , we calculate the overlap coefficient , where HBsAg-specific sequences in the CD4 T cell memory repertoire are normalized by the number of HBsAg-specific TCRβ found for each vaccinee . From this analysis , it can be concluded that there is a difference in HBsAg-specific TCRβ at day 60 between the three groups ( Figure 2D ) ( ANOVA p-value = 0 . 00238 ) . A Wilcoxon test between early-converters and other vaccinees shows a significant p-value of 0 . 000473 , indicating that early-converters have a higher relative frequency of vaccine-specific TCRβ sequences present in their memory CD4 T cell repertoire at day 60 compared to vaccinees from the two other groups in the cohort . In summary , vaccine-specific TCRβ sequences increased in breadth following vaccination in early-converters and constituted a significantly higher proportion of the memory CD4 T cell compartment post-vaccination . To quantify the T cell response at the level of individual peptides that make up the HBsAg , a peptide matrix designed to cover 54 overlapping peptides of the HBsAg was used to extract peptide-specific T cells using a CD40L/CD154 activation-induced marker ( AIM ) assay ( see Materials and methods for details ) . The top six peptides for each individual were selected for an in vitro peptide-specific CD4 T cell expansion and sorting for TCR sequencing ( Supplementary file 2 and Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) . In this manner , TCRβ sequences were identified for T cells reactive against 44 single HBsAg peptides . These were not uniformly distributed across the HBsAg amino acid sequence , with the most prominent epitopes covering the regions 1–15 , 129–144 , 149–164 , 161–176 , 181–200 , 213–228 . For each of those regions , more than 10 individuals had a strong T cell response and more than 150 unique TCRβ sequences could be identified ( Figure 3A ) . These peptide-specific TCRβ sequences can be utilized in a peptide-TCR interaction classifier to identify other TCRβ that are likely to react against same HBsAg epitopes , as it has been shown that similar TCRβ sequences tend to target the same epitopes ( De Neuter et al . , 2018; Meysman et al . , 2019 ) . These classifications were integrated into a model which outputs a ratio Rhbs , which represents the amount of HBsAg epitope-specific TCR sequences in an individual repertoire . The ratio is equal to the breadth of unique predicted HBsAg peptide-specific TCRβ divided by a normalization term for putative false positive predictions due to bystander activations in the training data set . The memory repertoire at day 60 shows that early-converters tend to have a higher breadth of putative HBsAg peptide-specific TCRβ , while late-converters tend to have relatively more putative false positives as per the normalization term ( Figure 3B ) . The ratio of these two terms Rhbs therefore shows a significant difference between early- and the late-converters at day 60 ( one-sided Wilcoxon-test p-value = 0 . 0313 , Figure 3C ) . Furthermore , searching for HBsAg peptide-specific clonotypes in the memory repertoires prior to vaccination ( day 0 ) results in a Rhbs with a similar difference ( one-sided Wilcoxon-test p-value = 0 . 0010 , Figure 3D ) . In this manner , the presence of HBsAg peptide-specific clonotypes as defined by the ratio Rhbs can be used as a classifier to distinguish early- from late-converters prior to vaccination ( Figure 3E ) , with an area under the curve ( AUC ) of 0 . 825 ( 95% CI: 0 . 657–0 . 994 ) in a leave-one-out cross-validation setting . A model in which age-matched vaccinees were included from early- and late-converters returned a similar receiver operating characteristic ( ROC ) curve , suggesting that this signal is not age-dependent ( Figure 3F ) . While Rhbs is able to differentiate between early- and late-converters , it seems to be worse at distinguishing non-converters . This is mainly due to a single non-converter vaccinee ( H21 ) with a high Rhbs , signifying a high number of putative HBsAg peptide-specific TCRβ in their memory repertoire . After showing evidence for the existence of vaccine-specific TCRβ sequences pre-vaccination and that individuals with a higher number of HBsAg peptide-specific clonotypes had earlier seroconversion , we attempted to link this observation to differences in vaccine-specific CD4 T cells responses using CD4 T cell assays . As TREG cells might suppress vaccine-induced immune responses ( Brezar et al . , 2016 ) , we used activation markers CD40L ( CD154 ) and 4-1BB ( CD137 ) to help delineate the conventional ( TCON ) and regulatory ( TREG ) phenotypes of activated CD4 T cells . In this scheme , after 6 hr of antigen stimulation , CD40L+4-1BB− can be used as a signature for antigen-specific CD4 TCON cells , as opposed to CD40L−4-1BB+ signature for antigen-specific CD4 TREG cells ( Elias et al . , 2020; Schoenbrunn et al . , 2012 ) . Additionally , we added CD25 and CD127 to better identify TREG cells ( Liu et al . , 2006; Seddiki et al . , 2006 ) and CXCR5 to further distinguish circulatory T follicular helper cells ( cTFH ) and circulatory T follicular regulatory cells ( cTFR ) ( Bentebibel et al . , 2011; Fonseca et al . , 2017 ) ( see Figure 4—figure supplement 1 for gating strategy ) . Using the converse expression of CD40L and 4-1BB , CD40L+4-1BB− and CD40L−4-1BB+ CD4 T cells have a CD25lowCD127high and CD25highCD127low phenotype , respectively ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2 ) , and validate their use for the distinction of activated TCON and TREG cells as described before ( Schoenbrunn et al . , 2012 ) . We detected a significant increase in the frequency of vaccine-specific CD40L+4-1BB− and CD40L−4-1BB+ memory CD4 T cells at day 60 in our cohort ( Figure 4A ) that correlated positively with the increase in antibody titer between day 0 and day 365 ( Figure 4B , Figure 4—figure supplement 3 ) . Upon a closer look , the induction of both signatures of vaccine-specific memory CD4 T cells was only true for early-converters ( Figure 4C , see Figure 4—figure supplement 4A for non-converters and Figure 4—figure supplement 4B for vaccine-specific CD4 T cells ) . Late-converters did not show a detectable memory CD4 T cell response . Although a subset of both early- and late-converters had detectable memory CD4 T cell responses prior to vaccination , we observed no significant differences in the frequencies of CD40L+4-1BB− and CD40L−4-1BB+ memory CD4 T cells between the two groups at day 0 ( Figure 4D ) . Collectively , flow cytometry data reveal that the expression of CD40L and 4-1BB in our ex vivo assay is consistent with our serological data and reflects the lack of seroconversion at day 60 in late-converters . However , it does not support the existence of more vaccine-specific memory CD4 T cells in early-converters prior to vaccination . Response groups used so far were established based on the dynamics of anti-HBs titers following vaccination . However , response groups can be defined based on the data of antigen specificity from the ex vivo CD4 T cell assay . Thus the frequency of CD40L+4-1BB− and CD40L−4-1BB+ memory CD4 T cells were used to define a low and high response group at three different times points ( days 60 , 180 , and 365 ) . For each time point , the same Rhbs metric was used in a leave-one-out cross-validation as before to differentiate between these novel response group definitions . Results indicate that the Rhbs metric is a good predictor for HBsAg-specific memory CD4 T cells with a TCON signature ( but not TREG signature ) identified at day 60 post-vaccination ( Figure 4E and F ) . However , the classifier is less performant for the prediction of CD4 T cell response at later time points . In order to detect any distinct signatures of early- and late-converters , we analyzed pre-vaccination flow cytometry data to examine major CD4 T cell subsets: TH , TREG , cTFH , and cTFR cells . Using manual gating in which regulatory T cells ( TREG ) were defined as viable CD3+CD4+CD8−CD25+CD127−CXCR5− and were further divided into CD45RA+ and CD45RA− TREG cells , we identified a significantly higher frequency of 4-1BB+ CD45RA− TREG cells in late-converters compared to early-converters ( Figure 5A and Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) . TREG cells showed higher 4-1BB expression compared to TH , cTFH , and cTFR cells ( Figure 5B ) and within TREG subset , CD45RA− TREG cells showed significantly higher expression of 4-1BB , accompanied with a higher expression of CD25 , compared to CD45RA+ TREG cells ( Figure 5C ) . In this scheme , CD45RA− TREG can be divided into 4-1BB+CD25high and 4-1BB-CD25int subsets . It is worth noting here that no differences were detected in the frequency of CD45RA− or CD45RA+ TREG cells within CD4 T cell compartment between the two groups ( Figure 5D ) , and that it is the composition of TREG compartment that is distinct between the two groups ( Figure 5E ) . In summary , an expanded subset of 4-1BB+CD45RA− TREG cells pre-vaccination is a prominent feature of a delayed and modest immune response to HB vaccine in our cohort . 3 Discussion In this study , we used high-throughput TCRβ repertoire profiling and ex vivo T cell assays to characterize memory CD4 T cell repertoires before and after immunization with HB vaccine , an adjuvanted subunit vaccine , and tracked vaccine-specific TCRβ clonotypes over two time points . As antigen-naïve adults were found to have an unexpected abundance of memory-phenotype CD4 T cells specific to viral antigens ( Su and Davis , 2013; Su et al . , 2013 ) , we sought to investigate the influence that preexisting memory CD4 T cells can have on vaccine-induced immunity . Commercially available HBV vaccines produce a robust and long-lasting anti-HBs response , and protection is provided by induction of an anti-HBs ( antibody against HBV surface antigen ) titer higher than 10 mIU/ml after a complete immunization schedule of three doses ( Meireles et al . , 2015 ) . However , 5–10% of healthy adult vaccinees fail to produce protective titers of anti-HBs and can be classified as non-responders ( Meireles et al . , 2015 ) . In our cohort , 13 vaccinees did not seroconvert by day 60 ( 30 days following administration of the second vaccine dose ) , as determined by antibody titer . Out of this group , nine vaccinees seroconverted by day 180 or day 365 , referred to here as late-converters , and four vaccinees did not seroconvert , referred to here as non-converters . A hallmark of adaptive immunity is a potential for memory immune responses to increase in both magnitude and quality upon repeated exposure to the antigen ( Sallusto et al . , 2010 ) . Our systems immunology data supports the theory that preexisting memory CD4 T cell TCRβ sequences specific to HBsAg , the antigenic component of the current HB vaccine , predict which individuals will mount an early and more vigorous immune response to the vaccine as evidenced by a higher fold change in anti-HBs antibody titer and a more significant induction of antigen-specific CD4 T cells . It is postulated that preexisting memory CD4 T cell clonotypes are generated due to the highly degenerate nature of T cell recognition of antigen/MHC and are cross-reactive to environmental antigens ( Sewell , 2012 ) . For example , preexisting memory CD4 T cells are well-established in unexposed HIV-seronegative individuals , although at a significantly lower magnitude than HIV-exposed seronegative individuals ( Campion et al . , 2014; Ritchie et al . , 2011 ) , and were likely primed by exposure to environmental triggers or the human microbiome . We and others have shown before that the TCRβ repertoire of CD4 T cells encodes the antigen exposure history of each individual and that antigen-specific TCRβ sequences could serve to automatically annotate the infection or exposure history ( DeWitt et al . , 2018; Emerson et al . , 2017; De Neuter et al . , 2019 ) . In this study , we show that similar principles can be used to study vaccine responsiveness . Specifically , the recruitment of novel vaccine-specific T cell clonotypes into memory compartment following vaccination can be tracked by examining the CD4 memory TCRβ repertoire over time . While we observed no increase in the frequency of the vaccine-specific memory T cells , as the time point may have missed the peak of the clonal expansion of effector CD4 T cells as was reported before ( Blom et al . , 2013; Kohler et al . , 2012; Pogorelyy et al . , 2018 ) , a significant rise in the number of unique vaccine-specific T cell clonotypes was detected . This observation is consistent with earlier studies of T cell immune repertoire that showed that antigen-specific TCRβ sequences do not always overlap with those sequences that increase in frequency after infection or vaccination ( DeWitt et al . , 2015 ) . More interestingly , individuals with the earlier and more robust response against the vaccine had a telltale antigen-specific signature in their memory TCRβ repertoire prior to vaccination , despite the lack of HBsAg antibodies and prior vaccination history . Detection of this vaccine-specific signature was possible due to the development of a novel predictive model that used epitope-specific TCRβ sequences from one set of individuals to make predictions about another . This is a non-trivial task as the MHC class II molecules vary between vaccinees , which in turn allows for great variation of the presented epitopes . However , we were able to cover the entire HBsAg and obtained a sufficient sample size to likely cover the most immunoprevalent epitopes . It can be presumed that we do not capture the full HBsAg T cell response , but obtain enough sequences which are representative for the response as a whole . In addition , a correction factor was needed to account for the occurrence of bystander-activated T cells within the original epitope-specific TCRβ sequences . Indeed , in those vaccinees without an early seroconversion ( at day 60 ) , putative vaccine-specific T cells might be induced due to bystander activation . This was supported by predictions using the TCRex tool ( Gielis et al . , 2019 ) , which matched these TCR sequences to common viral or other epitopes . It is of note that these TCRβ sequences are matched with CD8 T cell epitopes , while they originate from isolated CD4 T cells . This is likely due to the great similarity between the TCRβ sequences of CD4 and CD8 T cells as noted in prior research ( De Neuter et al . , 2018 ) . However , our in vitro antigen-specific data , using an assay that enables discrimination of TCON and TREG cells using the converse expression of the activation markers CD40L and 4-1BB ( Frentsch et al . , 2005; Schoenbrunn et al . , 2012 ) , failed to show a significant difference in preexisting antigen-specific CD4 T cells between early- and late-converters prior to vaccine administration . It is plausible that our activation proteins , CD40L and 4-1BB , might be unsuitable to detect preexisting memory CD4 T cells but this is unlikely as both proteins were used successfully in similar studies ( Bacher et al . , 2014a; Bacher et al . , 2014b ) . Another plausible explanation is that the signal is below the detection limit of the assay and that more sensitive techniques that require pre-enrichment of CD40L+ and 4-1BB+ T cells ( using magnetic beads ) ( Bacher et al . , 2013 ) or cultured ELISpot assay ( Reece et al . , 2004 ) are needed to capture preexisting vaccine-specific memory CD4 T cells directly from human peripheral blood . A similar disagreement between B cell receptor clonotype diversity underlying vaccine-induced response and a conventional B cell ELISpot assay was reported before following HB vaccination ( Galson et al . , 2016 ) . TREG cells represent about 5–10% of human CD4 T cell compartment and are identified by the constitutive surface expression of CD25 , also known as IL-2 receptor α subunit ( IL-2Ra ) , and the nuclear expression of forkhead family transcription factor 3 ( Foxp3 ) , a lineage specification factor of TREG cells ( Rudensky , 2011 ) . Regulatory memory T cells play a role in the mitigation of tissue damage induced by effector memory T cells during protective immune responses , resulting in a selective advantage against pathogen-induced immunopathology ( Garner-Spitzer et al . , 2013; Lanteri et al . , 2009; Lin et al . , 2018; Lovelace and Maecker , 2018 ) . Several studies have identified CD4 TREG cells with specificity to pathogen-derived peptides in murine models and showed evidence for an induced expansion of TREG cells followed by an emergence and a long-term persistence of TREG cells with a memory phenotype and potent immunosuppressive properties ( Lin et al . , 2018; Sanchez et al . , 2012 ) . Blom et al . reported a significant and transient activation of TREG cells ( identified by upregulation of CD38 and Ki67 ) in humans 10 days after administration of live attenuated yellow fever virus 17D vaccine ( Blom et al . , 2013 ) . The induction of vaccine-specific TREG cells in our cohort is unexpected and the role it might play in vaccine-induced immunity warrants further investigation . The association of an expanded 4-1BB+ CD45RA− TREG subset with a delayed immune response to HB vaccine was not described before . Miyara et al . showed that blood contains two distinct subsets of stable and suppressive TREG cells: resting TREG , identified as FOXP3lowCD45RA+ CD4 T cells , and activated TREG , identified as FOXP3highCD45RA− CD4 T cells . They further noted that activated TREG cells constitute a minority subset within cord blood TREG cells and increase gradually with age ( Miyara et al . , 2009 ) . As activated TREG cells were shown to have an increased expression of proteins indicative of activation , including ICOS and HLA-DR ( Booth et al . , 2010; Ito et al . , 2008; Mason et al . , 2015; Miyara et al . , 2009; Mohr et al . , 2018 ) , it might be the case that an upregulation of 4-1BB is one more feature of this population or a subset thereof . Moreover , TREG cells in mice were shown to modulate TFH formation and germinal center ( GC ) B cell responses and to diminish antibody production in a CTLA-4 mediated suppression ( Wing et al . , 2014 ) . Interestingly , CD45RA− TREG cells were shown to be more rich in preformed CTLA-4 stored in intracellular vesicles compared to CD45RA+ TREG cells ( Miyara et al . , 2009 ) . 4-1BB was shown to be constitutively expressed by TREG cells ( McHugh et al . , 2002 ) and that 4-1BB+ TREG cells are functionally superior to 4-1BB− TREG cells in both contact-dependent and contact-independent immunosuppression ( Kachapati et al . , 2012 ) . 4-1BB+ TREG cells are the major producers of the alternatively spliced and soluble isoform of 4-1BB among T cells ( Kachapati et al . , 2012 ) . 4-1BB was shown before to be preferentially expressed on TREG cells compared with other non-regulatory CD4 T cell subsets ( McHugh et al . , 2002 ) and that 4-1BB-costimualtion induces the expansion of TREG cells both in vitro and in vivo ( Zheng et al . , 2004 ) . Moreover , agonistic anti-4-1BB mAbs have been shown to abrogate T cell-dependent antibody responses in vivo ( Mittler et al . , 1999 ) and to ameliorate experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis by skewing the balance against TH17 differentiation in favor of TREG differentiation ( Kim et al . , 2011 ) . It is plausible that the expansion 4-1BB+CD45RA− TREG cells in late-converters is involved in the suppression of GC vaccine-specific TFH cells and the ensuing antibody response in our cohort , but this remains speculative and further research is warranted . It is enticing to speculate that the preexisting memory CD4 T cells result from the complex interplay between cellular immunity and the human microbiome . A role for the microbiota in modulating immunity to viral infection was suggested in 1960s ( Robinson and Pfeiffer , 2014 ) , and since then we gained better understanding of the impact of the various components of the microbiota including bacteria , fungi , protozoa , archaea , and viruses on the murine and human immune systems ( Winkler and Thackray , 2019 ) . Viral clearance of HB virus infection depends on the age of exposure and neonates and young children are less likely to spontaneously clear the virus ( Yuen et al . , 2018 ) . Han-Hsuan et al . have shown evidence in mice that this age dependency is mediated by gut microbiota that prepare the liver immunity system to clear HBV , possibly via a TLR4 signaling pathway ( Chou et al . , 2015 ) . In this study , young mice that have not reached an equilibrium in the gut microbiota exhibited prolonged HBsAg persistence , impaired anti-HBs antibody production , and limited Hepatitis B core antigen ( HBcAg ) -specific IFNγ+ splenocytes . More recently , Tingxin et al . provided evidence for a critical role of the commensal microbiota in supporting the differentiation of GC B cells , through follicular T helper ( TFH ) cells , to promote the anti-HBV humoral immunity ( Wu et al . , 2019 ) . Our study bears some intrinsic limitations . A major drawback is the restricted number of days at which TCRβ repertoire was profiled , as vaccine-specific perturbations within the repertoire may occur at different time points for early- , late- , and non-converters . Additionally , more in-depth characterization and functional studies on 4-1BB+CD45RA− TREG cells could have helped shed more light on the role they play in vaccine-induced immunity . Future studies in larger cohorts and with a more comprehensive TCRβ repertoire profiling and CD4 T cells immunophenotyping are required to validate our findings . In conclusion , our analysis of the memory CD4 T cell repertoire has uncovered a role for preexisting memory CD4 T cells in naïve individuals in mounting an earlier and more vigorous immune response to HB vaccine and argue for the utility of pre-vaccination TCRβ repertoire in the prediction of vaccine-induced immunity . Moreover , we identify a subset of 4-1BB+ memory TREG cells that is expanded in individuals with delayed immune response to the vaccine , which might further explain the heterogeneity of response to HB vaccine . 4 Materials and methods A total of 34 healthy individuals ( 20-29 years: 10 , 30-39 years: 7 , 40-49 years: 16 , 50+ years: 1 ) without a history of HBV infection or previous HB vaccination were recruited in this study after obtaining written informed consent . Individuals were vaccinated with an HB vaccine by intramuscular ( m . deltoideus ) injection ( Engerix-B containing 20 μg dose of alum-adjuvanted HBsAg , GlaxoSmithKline ) on days 0 and 30 ( and on day 365 ) . At days 0 ( pre-vaccination ) , 60 , 180 , and 365 ( Figure 1A ) , peripheral blood samples were collected on spray-coated lithium heparin tubes , spray-coated K2EDTA ( dipotassium ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid ) tubes , and serum tubes ( Becton Dickinson , NJ ) . Peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) were isolated by Ficoll-Paque Plus gradient separation ( GE Healthcare , Chicago , IL ) . Cells were stored in 10% dimethyl sulfoxide in fetal bovine serum ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA ) . After thawing and washing cryopreserved PBMC , cells were cultured in AIM-V medium that contained L-glutamine , streptomycin sulfate at 50 µg/ml , and gentamicin sulfate at 10 µg/ml ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA ) and supplemented with 5% human serum ( One Lambda , Canoga Park , CA ) . Serum was separated and stored immediately at – 80°C until time of analysis . Anti-HBs antibody was titrated in serum from day 0 , 60 , 180 , and 365 using Roche Elecsys Anti-HBs antibody assay on an Elecsys 2010 analyzer ( Roche , Basel , Switzerland ) . An anti-HBs titer above 10 IU/ml was considered protective ( Keating and Noble , 2003 ) . Serum IgG antibodies to CMV , EBV viral-capsid antigen , and HSV-1 and -2 were determined using commercially available sandwich ELISA kits in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions . A complete blood count including leukocyte differential was run on a hematology analyzer ( ABX MICROS 60 , Horiba , Kyoto , Japan ) . Total CD4 T cells were isolated by positive selection using CD4 magnetic microbeads ( Miltenyi Biotech , Bergisch Gladbach , Germany ) . Memory CD4 T cells were sorted after gating on single viable CD3+CD4+CD8−CD45RO+ cells . The following fluorochrome-labeled monoclonal antibodies were used for staining: CD3-PerCP ( BW264/56 ) ( Miltenyi Biotech ) , CD4-APC ( RPA-T4 ) , and CD45RO-PE ( UCHT1 ) ( both from Becton Dickinson , Franklin Lakes , NJ ) and CD8-Pacific Orange ( 3B5 ) ( from Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA ) . Cells were stained at room temperature for 20 min and sorted with FACSAria II ( Becton Dickinson , Franklin Lakes , NJ ) . Sytox blue ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA ) was used to exclude non-viable cells . A set of 15-mers peptides with an 11-amino acid overlap spanning the 226 amino acids along the small S protein of HBsAg , also designated as small HBs ( Shouval , 2003 ) , were synthesized by JPT Peptide Technologies ( Berlin , Germany ) . The set , composed of 54 single peptides ( see Supplementary file 1 ) , was used in a matrix-based strategy to map epitopes against which the immune response is directed as described before ( Precopio et al . , 2008 ) . The matrix layout enables efficient identification of epitopes within the antigen using a minimal number of cells . For this purpose , a matrix of 15 pools , 7 rows , and 8 columns , referred to as peptide matrix , was designed so that each peptide is in exactly one row-pool and one column-pool , thereby allowing for the identification of positive peptides at the intersection of positive pools . Matrix pools that induced a CD4 T cell response ( as determined by CD40L/CD154 assay described below ) which meets the threshold criteria for a positive response were considered in the deconvolution process . Top six single peptides were considered for peptide-specific T cell expansion and sorting . A master peptide pool is composed of all of the 54 single peptides and was used to identify and sort total vaccine-specific CD4 T cells . Each peptide was used at a final concentration of 2 µg/ml . VZV lysate was purchased from Microbix Biosystem ( Mississauga , Canada ) . Thawed PBMCs from each vaccinee were cultured in AIM-V medium that contained L-glutamine , streptomycin sulfate at 50 µg/ml , and gentamicin sulfate at 10 µg/ml ( GIBCO , Grand Island , NY ) and supplemented with 5% human serum ( One Lambda , Canoga Park , CA ) . Cells were stimulated for 6 hr with 2 μg/ml of each of the 15 peptide matrix pools in the presence of 1 µg/ml anti-CD40 antibody ( HB14 ) ( purchased from Miltenyi Biotec , Bergisch Gladbach , Germany ) and 1 μg/ml anti-CD28 antibody ( CD28 . 2 ) ( purchased from BD Biosciences , Franklin Lakes , NJ ) . Cells were stained using the following fluorochrome-labeled monoclonal antibodies: CD3-PerCP ( BW264/56 ) , CD4-APC ( REA623 ) , CD8-VioGreen ( REA734 ) , and CD40L-PE ( 5C8 ) ( purchased from Miltenyi Biotec , Bergisch Gladbach , Germany ) . Viability dye Sytox blue from Invitrogen ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA ) was used to exclude non-viable cells . Data was acquired on FACSAria II using Diva Software , both from BD Biosciences ( Franklin Lakes , NJ ) , and analyzed on FlowJo software version 10 . 5 . 3 ( Tree Star , Inc , Ashland , OR ) . Fluorescence-minus-one controls were performed in pilot studies . Gates for CD40L+CD4 T cells were set using cells left unstimulated . Thawed PBMCs were labeled with CFSE ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) and cultured in AIM-V medium that contained L-glutamine , streptomycin sulfate at 50 µg/ml , and gentamicin sulfate at 10 µg/ml ( GIBCO , Grand Island , NY ) and supplemented with 5% human serum ( One Lambda , Canoga Park , CA ) . Cells were stimulated for 7 days with 2 µg/ml of selected single peptides in addition to the master peptides pool . Cells were also stimulated with 4 µg/ml of a VZV lysate and used as a baseline control . Cells were stained using the following fluorochrome-labeled monoclonal antibodies: CD3-PerCP ( BW264/56 ) , CD4-APC ( REA623 ) , and CD8-VioGreen ( REA734 ) ( purchased from Miltenyi Biotec , Bergisch Gladbach , Germany ) . Viability dye Sytox blue from Invitrogen ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA ) was used to exclude non-viable cells . Single viable CFSElow CD3+ CD8− CD4+ T cells were sorted into 96-well PCR plates containing DNA/RNA Shield ( Zymo Research , Irvine , CA ) using FACSAria II and Diva Software ( BD Biosciences , Franklin Lakes , NJ ) . For each of the selected single peptides , 500 cells were sorted in two technical replicates . For the master peptide pool and VZV lysate , 1000 cells were sorted in two technical replicates . Plates were immediately centrifuged and kept at –20°C before TCR cDNA library preparation and sequencing . DNA was extracted from sorted memory CD4 T cells using Quick-DNA Microprep kit ( Zymo Research , Irvine , CA ) . ImmunoSEQ hsTCRB sequencing kit ( Adaptive Biotechnologies , Seattle , WA ) was used to profile TCRβ repertoire following the manufacturer’s protocol . After quality control using Fragment Analyzer ( Agilent , Santa Clara , CA ) , libraries were pooled with equal volumes . The concentration of the final pool was measured with the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay kit ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA ) . The final pool was processed to be sequenced on the Miseq and NextSeq platforms ( Illumina , San Diego , CA ) . Memory CD4 T cells of one of the vaccinees ( H42 , a non-converter ) was not sequenced due to a capacity issue . RNA was extracted from each of the two technical replicates of sorted CFSElow CD4 T cells using Quick-RNA Microprep kit ( Zymo Research , Irvine , CA ) . Without measuring the resulting RNA concentration , an RNA-based library preparation was used . The QIAseq Immune Repertoire RNA Library kit ( Qiagen , Venlo , The Netherlands ) amplifies TCRα , -β , -γ , and -δ chains . After quality control using Fragment Analyzer ( Agilent , Santa Clara , CA ) , concentration was measured with the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay kit ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA ) and pools were equimolarly pooled and prepared for sequencing on the NextSeq platform ( Illumina , San Diego , CA ) . TCRβ clonotypes were identified as previously described ( De Neuter et al . , 2019 ) where a unique TCRβ clonotype is defined as a unique combination of a V gene , CDR3 amino acid sequence , and J gene . All memory CD4 T cell DNA-based TCRβ sequencing reads were annotated using the immunoSEQ analyzer ( v2 ) from Adaptive Biotechnologies . All small bulk RNA-based TCR sequencing reads were annotated using the MiXCR tool ( v3 . 0 . 7 ) from the FASTQ files . As all RNA-based TCR sequencing experiments featured two technical replicates , only those TCR sequences that occurred in both replicates were retained and their counts were summed . Tracking of vaccine-specific TCRβ clonotypes is based on exact TCRβ CDR3 amino acid matches to remove any bias introduced by the different VDJ annotation pipelines . Non-HBsAg TCR annotations were done with the TCRex web tool ( Gielis et al . , 2019 ) on the July 24 , 2019 , using version 0 . 3 . 0 . Breadth of the TCR sequences is defined as the number of unique TCR clonotypes belonging to a given set , divided by the total number of unique clonotypes in a repertoire . Inference of similar epitope binding between two TCR sequences is defined according to the Hamming distance ( d ) calculated on the CDR3 amino acid sequence with a cutoff c = 1 , as supported by prior research where it was shown that it was equivalent to the performance of more complex methods such as TCRdist ( Dash et al . , 2017 ) or k-mer clustering when applied to TCRβ chains only ( De Neuter et al . , 2018; Valkiers et al . , 2021 ) . All scripts used in this analysis are available via GitHub ( https://github . com/pmeysman/HepBTCR , copy archived at swh:1:rev:bdda21dde671ac2e424e85bd270efafa719d4cb4 , Meysman , 2022 ) . From the single peptide data generated in the epitope mapping experiments , we aimed to create a predictive model to enumerate the HBs response from full TCRβ repertoire data . This approach allows for predictions that are epitope-specific rather than simply vaccine-specific . This model was applied in a leave-one-out cross-validation so that vaccine-specific TCRβ sequences from a vaccinee are not used to make predictions for the same vaccinee . While the predictive model is derived from epitope-specific data , it cannot be guaranteed that some of the expanded CD4 T cells detected in the in vitro assay are not due to bystander activation . Vaccine-specific TCRβ sequences of vaccinees who did not respond to the vaccine at day 60 ( late-converters and non-converters ) are expected to be more enriched in cells triggered to expand due to bystander activation . Indeed , running the set of vaccine-specific TCRβ sequences through the TCRex webtool ( Gielis et al . , 2019 ) reveals that several TCRs are predicted to be highly similar to those reactive to the CMV NLVPMVATV epitope ( enrichment p-value < 0 . 001 when compared to the TCRex background repertoire ) and the Mart-1 variant ELAGIGILTV epitope ( p-value < 0 . 001 ) , which supports the notion that some of these TCRβ sequences might not be specific to HBsAg . This set of vaccine-specific TCRβ sequences can thus be used to make predictions about possible TCRβ sequences due to bystander activation of CD4 T cells , that is , common TCRβ sequences that might be present as false positives . The final output of the model is thus a ratio , Rhbs , for any repertoire repi describing a set of TCRβ sequences trepi:Rhbs ( trepi ) = ∑pep=154x ∈ trepiminy ∈tpep dx , y§amp;lt;c/tpep x ∈trepiminy ∈tbystander dx , y§amp;lt;c/tbystander with tpep as the set of TCRβ sequences occurring in both biological replicates for a single sample and a single peptide ( pep ) from the HBsAg epitope mapping experiment , and tbystander as the set of TCRβ sequences occurring in both biological replicates of the master peptide pool in any of the non-responding samples . Thus , the ratio signifies the number of TCR clonotypes predicted to be reactive against one of the HBsAg peptides , normalized by a count of putative false positive predictions from bystander T cells . Thawed PBMCs from each vaccinee were cultured in AIM-V medium that contained L-glutamine , streptomycin sulfate at 50 µg/ml , and gentamicin sulfate at 10 µg/ml ( GIBCO , Grand Island , NY ) and supplemented with 5% human serum ( One Lambda , Canoga Park , CA ) . Cells were stimulated for 6 hr with 2 μg/ml of a master peptide pool representing the full length of the small surface envelope protein of HB , in the presence of 1 µg/ml anti-CD40 antibody ( HB14 ) ( purchased from Miltenyi Biotec , Bergisch Gladbach , Germany ) and 1 μg/ml anti-CD28 antibody ( CD28 . 2 ) ( purchased from BD Biosciences , Franklin Lakes , NJ ) . Cells were stained using the following fluorochrome-labeled monoclonal antibodies: CD3-BV510 ( SK7 ) , CD4-PerCP/Cy5 . 5 ( RPA-T4 ) , CD8-APC/Cy7 ( SK1 ) , CD45RA-AF488 ( HI100 ) , CD25-BV421 ( M-A251 ) , CD127-BV785 ( A019D5 ) , and CD137-PE ( 4-1BB ) ( purchased from BioLegend , San Diego , CA ) , CXCR5 ( CD185 ) -PE-eFluor 610 ( MU5UBEE ) ( from eBioscience , Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA ) and CD40L-APC ( 5C8 ) ( purchased from Miltenyi Biotec , Bergisch Gladbach , Germany ) . Fixable viability dye Zombie NIR from BioLegend ( San Diego , CA ) was used to exclude non-viable cells . Data was acquired on FACSAria II using Diva Software , both from BD Biosciences ( Franklin Lakes , NJ ) , and analyzed on FlowJo software version 10 . 5 . 3 ( Tree Star , Inc , Ashland , OR ) using gating strategy shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 1A . Fluorescence-minus-one controls were performed in pilot studies . Gates for CD40L+ and 4-1BB+ CD4 T cells ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1B ) were set using cells left unstimulated ( negative control contained DMSO at the same concentration used to solve peptide pools ) . In order to account for background expression of CD40L and 4-1BB on CD4 T cells , responses in cells left unstimulated were subtracted from the responses to peptides , and when peptides-specific CD40L+ or 4-1BB+ CD4 T cells were not significantly higher than those detected for cells left unstimulated ( using one-sided Fisher’s exact test ) , values were mutated to zero . The two-sided Fisher’s exact test was used to evaluate the significance of relationship between early/late-converters and CMV , EBV , or HSV seropositivity . For the visualization of marker expression , TCRβ counts and cell frequencies between time points or groups of vaccinees , ggplot2 ( v3 . 3 . 2 ) , ggpubr ( v0 . 2 . 5 ) , and rstatix ( v0 . 7 . 0 ) packages in R were used . The Wilcoxon rank sum test and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test were used to compare two or more groups , with unpaired and paired analysis as necessary . Bonferroni correction was applied when multiple comparisons were made . The nonparametric Spearman’s rank-order correlation was used to test for correlation . We used the following convention for symbols indicating statistical significance; ns p > 0 . 05 , *p ≤ 0 . 05 , **p ≤ 0 . 01 , ***p ≤ 0 . 001 , ****p ≤ 0 . 0001 ."}

In vertebrates , such as mice and humans , this response often involves both an ‘innate’ and an ‘adaptive’ component . The innate immune response is fast but it is not targeted at the specific pathogen that needs to be eliminated . The adaptive immune response is slower , but it is also stronger and tailored to combat the specific pathogen that is attacking the host . In general , both the innate and adaptive immune responses work together to combat the infection . The innate immune system is activated when host cells are damaged or stressed , or when ‘foreign’ molecules that are tell-tale signs of microbes and pathogens are detected . It enlists white blood cells that engulf and digest infected host cells or pathogens , and then display the digested fragments via proteins called major histocompatibility complexes . The adaptive immune response relies on other white blood cells called B cells ( which make antibodies ) and T cells ( which carry out a variety of roles ) . Each T cell will respond to a very specific fragment of protein displayed by a major histocompatibility complex . Although a bacteria or virus can generate thousands of protein fragments , only a select few will stimulate an immune response . This phenomenon is known as immunodominance . As T cells mature in the thymus—a specialized organ located in the chest—they undergo both positive and negative selection . To survive positive selection , the T cells must be able to recognize fragments from the host’s own proteins . Negative selection removes T cells that interact too strongly with these ‘self-peptides’ because such interactions will cause the T cells to destroy the host’s tissues and cause auto-immune diseases . Positive selection is thought to have an important role in immunodominance because it shapes the population of T cells released from the thymus , but it has been difficult to test this hypothesis . Now Lo et al . have explored this question by engineering transgenic mice in which gp250—a self peptide that positively selects T cells that respond to a foreign protein called MCC—was the only self peptide to be presented during positive selection . Subsequent experiments showed that the mature T cells released by the thymus increased the fraction of T cells that were capable of responding to the dominant fraction of possible MCC fragments . By establishing a clear connection between positive selection and immunodominance , the work of Lo et al . could assist the development of more effective vaccines .", "article": "1 Introduction An individual pathogen encodes thousands of potentially immunogenic epitopes , yet during the course of an infection , generally only a fraction of epitopes actually stimulate T cell response ( Sercarz et al . , 1993; Sant et al . , 2007; Weaver and Sant , 2009; Jenkins et al . , 2010 ) . This fundamental feature of T cell responses is known as immunodominance ( Sercarz et al . , 1993; Chen et al . , 2001; Yewdell and Del Val , 2004; Yewdell , 2006; Sant et al . , 2007; Weaver and Sant , 2009; Jenkins and Moon , 2012 ) . Most of the effort in immunodominance studies has focused on the antigen presentation and processing pathways ( Deng et al . , 1993; van Ham et al . , 1996; Nanda and Sant , 2000; Chen et al . , 2001; Crowe et al . , 2003; Chen and McCluskey , 2006; Lazarski et al . , 2006; Yewdell , 2006; Weaver and Sant , 2009 ) . Yet immunodominance is also defined by the frequencies of naive T cells specific for individual antigens ( Kotturi et al . , 2008; Jenkins and Moon , 2012; Kwok et al . , 2012 ) . Given that thymic positive selection serves as a major developmental process to generate mature T cell repertoires ( Jameson et al . , 1995; Morris and Allen , 2012 ) , one may reason positive selection would play a role in determining naive T cell precursor frequency to dictate immunodominance . However , this possibility has been difficult to address directly , due to several technological issues . First , the frequency of T cells specific for individual peptide–MHC ligands is at most about 20–100 cells per million naive T cells ( Jenkins and Moon , 2012 ) , making it difficult to identify such an infrequent population . Second , to directly test the potential role of positive selection in immunodominance requires the knowledge of what T cell population specific for a defined antigen a positively selecting ligand is capable of selecting . Therefore , the low frequency of naive T cell precursor and the ignorance of essential information have limited the examination of the roles of positive selecting ligands in dictating naive T cell precursor frequency and immunodominance . The murine CD4+ T cell response against cytochrome c is an outstanding model system to investigate the impact of positively selecting ligands on immunodominance ( Solinger et al . , 1979; Schwartz , 1985; Engel and Hedrick , 1988 ) . Only one single dominant epitope emerges from the immunization of H−2k mice with the whole protein of moth cytochrome c ( MCC ) or closely related pigeon cytochrome c ( PCC ) ( Hedrick et al . , 1982; Winoto et al . , 1986; Hedrick et al . , 1988; McHeyzer-Williams and Davis , 1995 ) . Also , the MCC- or PCC-stimulated CD4+ T cell response shows highly organized immunodominance hierarches . The MCC- or PCC-specific responses are highly dominated by Vα11+ TCR , and exhibit several conserved CDR3 features ( Winoto et al . , 1986; Hedrick et al . , 1988; McHeyzer-Williams and Davis , 1995; McHeyzer-Williams et al . , 1999; Mikszta et al . , 1999; Newell et al . , 2011 ) . During MCC-specific responses , the Vα11+Vβ3+ CD4+ T cells are the most dominant responders , while Vα11+ TCRs pairing with Vβ6+ , Vβ8+ , or Vβ14+ are the subdominant responders ( Miyazaki et al . , 1996; Malherbe et al . , 2004 ) . Based on the structural data , certain positions at CDR3α and CDR3β regions , where TCR make contact with MCC peptide , present highly conserved amino acid usages ( McHeyzer-Williams et al . , 1999; Newell et al . , 2011 ) . These features constitute the strength of utilizing cytochrome c as a model antigen to study CD4+ immunodominance . Moreover , the MCC/I-Ek tetramers have been shown to be able to detect most primary MCC-specific T cells ( Savage et al . , 1999 ) . Importantly , our laboratory had previously identified a naturally occurring positively selecting self-peptide , termed gp250 , for its ability to positively select the MCC-specific TCR: AND ( Lo et al . , 2009 ) . In this study , we have generated a transgenic mouse line , the gp250 single chain ( SC ) mouse , in which the gp250/I-Ek was the only MHC class II ligand presented . Combining MCC tetramer analysis and our gp250 SC mice permitted us to elucidate the relationship between positively selecting ligands and antigen specificities of post-selection CD4+ T cell repertoires . Several studies have attempted to investigate the antigen specificities of the post-selection T cell repertoire by limiting the diversity of positively selecting self-peptides ( Kouskoff et al . , 1993; Ignatowicz et al . , 1996; Miyazaki et al . , 1996; Fukui et al . , 1997; Grubin et al . , 1997; Ignatowicz et al . , 1997; Nakano et al . , 1997; Surh et al . , 1997; Tourne et al . , 1997; Gapin et al . , 1998; Barton and Rudensky , 1999; Chmielowski et al . , 2000; Barton et al . , 2002; Huseby et al . , 2005 ) . Studies that limit the diversity of positively selecting self-peptides to a single peptide have involved the introduction of a transgene that encoded a defined peptide covalently linked to MHC class II ( Ignatowicz et al . , 1996 , 1997; Liu et al . , 1997; Huseby et al . , 2005 ) , disruption of the peptide exchange molecules H-2M ( Miyazaki et al . , 1996; Grubin et al . , 1997; Surh et al . , 1997; Tourne et al . , 1997 ) , expression of a human invariant chain transgene in which CLIP peptide was replaced with other self-peptides ( Barton and Rudensky , 1999; Barton et al . , 2002 ) , or viral expression of altered peptide ligands in the thymus ( Kouskoff et al . , 1993; Nakano et al . , 1997 ) . Altogether these studies concluded that a single peptide could select a large repertoire of T cells and that the recognition of positively selecting ligands is the driving force behind determining the antigen specificities of post-selection T cell repertoire ( Ignatowicz et al . , 1996; Fukui et al . , 1997; Grubin et al . , 1997; Ignatowicz et al . , 1997; Surh et al . , 1997; Fukui et al . , 1998; Gapin et al . , 1998; Barton and Rudensky , 1999; Chmielowski et al . , 2000; Barton et al . , 2002; Huseby et al . , 2005 ) . However , these studies were unable to examine immunodominance because they did not utilize a naturally occurring positively selecting ligand for a defined foreign antigen . The selection of Vα11+Vβ3+ TCRs was greatly enhanced in our gp250 SC mice . CDR3 sequencing revealed that gp250 skewed the positive selection toward MCC-reactive conserved CDR3 features , especially those CDR3s with serine at α91 and asparagine at β97 . Our hypothesis that gp250 favors the positive selection of MCC-reactive T cells was further supported by the greatly expanded MCC-tetramer+ population in gp250 SC mice . Our data provide direct evidence that positive selection plays a central role in determining the post-selection T cell repertoire and is a major determinant in immunodominance . 2 Results To explore the relationship between positive selection and CD4+ T cell immunodominance , we utilized the MCC model antigen system . The MCC88–103 peptide ( referred to MCC hereafter ) is an immunodominant peptide following immunization with the MCC protein , and the MCC primary responders and memory cells are exclusively dominated by Vα11+ T cells ( Winoto et al . , 1986; Hedrick et al . , 1988; McHeyzer-Williams and Davis , 1995; McHeyzer-Williams et al . , 1999; Mikszta et al . , 1999; Malherbe et al . , 2004; Newell et al . , 2011 ) . The basis for the Vα11+ dominant response has not been established . The AND TCR is one of the dominant MCC-responsive TCRs and consists of Vα11 and Vβ3 gene segments ( Hedrick et al . , 1988; Kaye et al . , 1989; McHeyzer-Williams and Davis , 1995; McHeyzer-Williams et al . , 1999; Mikszta et al . , 1999 ) . Essential for these studies was our previous identification of the naturally occurring positively selecting ligand , gp250 , for AND T cells ( Lo et al . , 2009 ) . To examine gp250’s effect on the post-selection MCC-specific T cell repertoire , we constructed a transgenic mouse line using the MHC class II promoter in which all of the MHC class II molecules contained the gp250 self-peptide via a covalent linkage of the peptide to the MHC class II β chain . We obtained one B6 founder in which the gp250 covalently linked I-Ek β chain had successfully integrated and was expressed . The I-Ek α chain was introduced into the founder by crossing to previously generated I-Ekα transgenic mice ( Griffiths et al . , 1994 ) . The mice were subsequently bred onto B6 MHC class II−/− to eliminate other class II molecules and CD74−/− background to assure the gp250/I-Ek is the only MHC class II ligand ( Ignatowicz et al . , 1996 , 1997 ) . The following experiments were all executed with the transgenic mice on the B6 MHC class II−/− and CD74−/− background ( termed gp250 SC mice hereafter ) . In gp250 SC mice , the transgenic covalently linked gp250/I-Ekβ successfully paired with transgenic I-Ekα , restoring the surface expression of I-Ek in splenic B cells and CD11c+ dendritic cells ( Figure 1A–D ) . The level of expression of the gp250/I-Ek was readily detectable , but reconstituted to approximately a 10% level on B cells and 40% on dendritic cells ( Figure 1A–D ) . Immunofluorescence staining of thymic frozen sections of gp250 SC mice showed surface expression of I-Ek in the cortex and medulla of the thymus ( data not shown ) . This level of expression was advantageous for our study in that we had detectable expression , but not supra-physiological levels of a single peptide-MHC and provided us with a suitable window to examine the positive selection mediated by gp250 self-peptide . 10 . 7554/eLife . 01457 . 003Figure 1 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 01457 . 003 The covalently linked gp250/I-Ek positively selected a large number of CD4+ T cells in the thymus with an average of 1 . 6 × 108 total thymocytes and 6 . 8 × 107 CD4SP T cells ( Figure 2A–C ) . The positive selection efficiency for CD4SP T cells in the gp250 SC mouse was approximately 40% of that seen in the B6 . K wild type ( Figure 2B , C ) , in line with other published single chain mice . The size of CD8SP T cells in gp250 SC mouse was comparable to that in B6 . K ( Figure 2D ) , as anticipated given that the gp250 SC mice expressed normal class I molecules . The higher percentage of CD8SP T cells is a reflection of the less efficient CD4SP selection ( Figure 2B–D ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 01457 . 004Figure 2 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 01457 . 005 In the spleen , the peripheral CD4+ T cell population in gp250 SC mice was readily detectable , being around 40% of the B6 . K , yet still averaged 1 . 7 × 106 CD4+ T cells per spleen ( Figure 2E–G ) . The single gp250/I-Ek ligand selected a full TCR Vβ repertoire , in that we did not observe any complete absence of Vβs ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) . However , the frequencies of some TCR Vβs were decreased , including Vβ2+ , Vβ4+ , Vβ8 . 1/8 . 2+ , suggesting gp250/I-Ek did not positively select individual Vβs with a uniform selection capability ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1A ) . The usages of Vβ5+ , Vβ11+ , and Vβ12+ were also increased in peripheral CD4+ T cells in gp250 SC mice ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1B ) . Given gp250/I-Ek was the only ligand presented by MHC class II molecules in gp250 SC mice , it was possible that the increased Vβs were caused by the lack of negative selection . We therefore used B6 . K hematopoietic stem cells ( HSCs ) to reconstitute lethally irradiated gp250 SC mice ( B6 . K > gp250 SC; Figure 2—figure supplement 1C ) . In B6 . K > gp250 chimeras , radiation-resistant epithelial cells presented gp250 as the only ligand to promote positive selection , while B6 . K bone marrow-derived antigen presenting cells presented a full peptide repertoire to restore negative selection . After a 12-week reconstitution , in B6 . K > gp250 chimeras , the frequencies of Vβ5+ , Vβ11+ and Vβ12+ were indistinguishable when compared with B6 . K > B6 . K chimeras ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1C , D ) . The CD8+ T cell population in gp250 SC mice was similar to the size in B6 . K mice ( Figure 2H ) , and the Vβ usages of CD8+ T cells in B6 . K > gp250 chimeras were comparable to the frequencies in B6 . K > B6 . K mice ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1D ) . The data reflected MHC class I-mediated positive selection was relatively intact , given no alternation was made on MHC class I-restricted peptide presentation . Together , the data show that the single gp250/I-Ek ligand was capable of positively selecting a large population of CD4+ T cells , which then could be further analyzed in detail . We used MCC-tetramers to identify MCC-specific population in CD4SP thymocytes and peripheral CD4+ T cells . The gp250-mediated positive selection dramatically expanded the MCC-specific CD4+ T cell response ( Figure 3 ) . In gp250 SC mice , the MCC tetramer+ CD4+ population showed a threefold increase in the periphery and a twofold increase in the thymus , compared with the population in B6 . K mice ( Figure 3A , B ) . Considering that the size of the CD4+ T cell population in gp250 SC mice was around 40% of the CD4+ T cell population in B6 . K mice ( Figure 2 ) , the augmented MCC-tetramer+ frequency was even more impressive . While T cell populations specific for other foreign antigens very likely became smaller , T cells specific for MCC increased in percentage , or at least stayed comparable to T cells selected by diverse self-peptide repertoire in terms of the absolute number . Indeed , the MCC tetramer+ population was uniquely expanded in the gp250-selected CD4+ T cell repertoire , as the frequency of the hemoglobin antigen ( Hb ) tetramer-bound CD4+ T cell population was equivalent , if not slightly decreased ( Figure 3C , D ) . To show that the increased MCC tetramer+ population was the product of gp250-mediated positive selection not due to the lack of negative selection , we generated radiation bone marrow chimeras ( Figure 3E , F ) . We used B6 . K hematopoietic stem cells ( HSCs ) to reconstitute lethally irradiated gp250 SC mice ( B6 . K > gp250 SC ) . The B6 . K HSC-reconstituted B6 . K bone marrow chimeras served as the controls ( B6 . K > B6 . K ) . After a 12-week reconstitution , the frequency of MCC tetramer+ CD4+ T cells was 1 . 5% in B6 . K HSC-reconstituted gp250 SC mice ( Figure 3E , F ) . Compared with the frequency of MCC tetramer+ population in B6 . K HSC-reconstituted B6 . K mice , which was about 0 . 18% , gp250-mediated positive selection enriched MCC tetramer+ cells more than eightfold ( Figure 3E , F ) . The B6 . K HSC-reconstituted gp250 chimeras suggested the augmented MCC tetramer+ population in gp250 SC mice was not due to the lack of negative selection . Taken together , our data showed that gp250-mediated positive selection enriched for MCC-specific CD4+ T cells . 10 . 7554/eLife . 01457 . 006Figure 3 . gp250-mediated positive selection greatly expands MCC-tetramer+ CD4+ T cells .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 01457 . 006 The polyclonal MCC-specific T cell memory responses are strongly dominated by Vα11+ CD4+ T cells; however , the basis of this is not known ( Winoto et al . , 1986; Engel and Hedrick , 1988; McHeyzer-Williams and Davis , 1995; McHeyzer-Williams et al . , 1999; Mikszta et al . , 1999; Malherbe et al . , 2004; Newell et al . , 2011 ) . We hypothesized that recognition of a positively selecting ligand may influence a specific antigen response through optimizing the selection of dominant TCRs . We therefore included the TCR Vα11 staining in MCC-tetramer experiments to examine the Vα11+ TCR expression in gp250-selected MCC-specific CD4+ T cells ( Figure 4A , B ) . In B6 . K CD4+ T cells , the MCC tetramer+ populations that used Vα11− vs Vα11+ were about equal , whereas in gp250 SC mice , the vast majority of MCC tetramer+ population expressed Vα11+ ( Figure 4A , B ) . It was the increased Vα11+ MCC tetramer+ cells that specifically contributed to the enlarged MCC tetramer+ population in gp250 SC mice , since the frequency of Vα11− MCC tetramer+ population in gp250 SC mice was comparable with the frequency in B6 . K mice ( Figure 4B ) . The exclusively enlarged Vα11+ MCC tetramer+ population in gp250 SC mice suggested that gp250/I-Ek specifically favored the positive selection of Vα11+ TCR , thus resulting in a T cell repertoire profile with the enhanced MCC tetramer-bound population . The MCC tetramer+ T cells were responsive to MCC , as the sorted MCC tetramer+ CD4+ T cells upregulated CD69 while stimulated overnight with MCC-pulsed APC in vitro ( Figure 4C , D ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 01457 . 007Figure 4 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 01457 . 007 The TCR Vβ usages in Vα11+-driven MCC-specific response exhibit a highly organized immunodominance hierarchy . On day 7 post immunization , about 50% of MCC-reactive T cells were Vα11+Vβ3+ , and Vα11+Vβ6+ , Vα11+Vβ8+ , Vα11+Vβ14+ constituted the remaining 50% MCC-reactive T cells . Observing gp250-mediated selection promoted the MCC-specific CD4+ T cells toward the usage of Vα11+ , we next examined the selection of MCC-preferred dominant and subdominant TCR pairs in gp250 SC mice ( Figure 5 ) . The Vα11+-expressing CD4+ T cells significantly increased in the thymus and periphery in gp250 SC mice ( Figure 5A , B ) , suggesting gp250/I-Ek actively skewed the post-selection TCR usages to influence antigen specificities . While examining the TCR Vβ expression among gp250-selected Vα11+ CD4+ T cells , MCC-preferred dominant pair Vα11+Vβ3+ increased about 1 . 4-fold in thymic CD4SP and at least twofold in periphery ( Figure 5C–E ) . Certain subdominant MCC-preferred TCRs also increased ( Figure 5C–E ) . Interestingly , for some Vβs , found commonly to pair with Vα11 in normal mice ( such as Vβ2 and Vβ4 ) , the frequencies were unchanged ( Figure 5C ) . This observation argued that gp250 specifically promoted the selection of MCC-specific TCR usages , and was not merely functioning as a good selecting ligand for all Vα11+ . The increased frequency of Vα11+Vβ3+ did not result from the absence of negative selection in gp250 SC mice ( Figure 5F ) . While reconstituted lethally irradiated gp250 SC mice with B6 . K HSC cells , the negative selection in gp250 SC mice was restored due to the presence of B6 . K HSC-derived antigen presenting cells in the thymus . After a 12-week reconstitution , Vα11+ CD4+ peripheral T cells in B6 . K > gp250 SC bone marrow chimeras were about 2 . 5-fold larger than the size in B6 . K > B6 . K chimeras ( Figure 5F ) . The Vα11+Vβ3+ population increased to approximately threefold in B6 . K > gp250 SC chimeras , compared with the population in B6 . K > B6 . K chimera mice as well ( Figure 5F ) . The bone marrow reconstitution data clearly supported gp250-mediated positive selection was the driving force to cause the enlarged MCC-specific CD4+ population . 10 . 7554/eLife . 01457 . 008Figure 5 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 01457 . 008 In addition to the preferred TCR Vα and Vβ usages , MCC-responsive CD4+ T cells also showed strikingly conserved CDR3 features , including the preferred four CDR3 residues: glutamic acid at CDR3 α89 ( α89E ) , serine at α91 ( α91S ) , asparagine at CDR3 β97 ( β97N ) , and alanine/glycine at β99 ( β99A/G ) ( McHeyzer-Williams et al . , 1999; Newell et al . , 2011 ) . The crystal structures of TCR:pMHC complexes have provided the structural explanation for these conserved CDR3 residues for each may form salt bridge or hydrogen bond with MCC TCR contact residues at P3 ( tyrosine ) , P5 ( lysine ) , and P8 ( threonine ) ( Newell et al . , 2011 ) . To elucidate the amino acid residues at these specific CDR3 positions , we performed single cell repertoire analysis and large-scale bulk CDR3 sequence studies ( Figure 6 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 01457 . 009Figure 6 .

We successfully recovered 38 sequences of TCR Vα11 ( Table 1 ) , among which five also had the co-expressed Vβ3 sequences identified ( Table 2 ) . The Vα11+Vβ3+ populations were also sent for large-scale bulk CDR3α and CDR3β sequencing to extensively explore CDR3 features .

In B6 . K mice , about 20% of Vα11+Vβ3+ CD4+ T cells expressed serine at CDR3 α91 , whereas in gp250 SC mice , the frequency was increased 1 . 5-fold to become about 30% ( Figure 6A , B ) . We observed a similar 1 . 5-fold increase of serine at α91 in single cell repertoire analysis compared to the published data ( McHeyzer-Williams et al . , 1999 ) ( Figure 6B ) . However , gp250-mediated selection had little impact on skewing the amino acid residue at CDR3 α89 , as α89E usages of Vα11+Vβ3+ CD4+ T cells were comparable with the frequency seen in B6 . K ( Figure 6A , B ) . The large-scale bulk CDR3β sequencing showed gp250-mediated positive selection dramatically escalated the usages of β97N , slightly increased the frequency of β99A , and had no effect on the frequency of β99G ( Figure 6C , D ) . Nevertheless , B6 . K CDR3β features were highly similar to the published CDR3β’s ( McHeyzer-Williams et al . , 1999; Figure 6C , D ) . The CDR3 β97N residue was hypothesized to hydrogen bond with MCC P8 backbone carbonyl and MCC P8 threonine side-chain hydroxyl groups ( Newell et al . , 2011 ) . The significantly increased usages of CDR3 α91S and β97N in gp250-selected Vα11+Vβ3+ T cells may also help explain the augmented MCC-tetramer bound population in gp250 SC mice . Altogether , our data changed our current understanding of the relationship between positively selecting self-peptides and post-selection T cell repertoire ( Figure 7 ) . With the well-defined MCC’s highly organized immunodominance hierarchy , we discovered gp250’s active role in promoting the positive selection of good MCC responders . The self-peptide gp250 enhanced the selection of Vα11+Vβ3+ T cells , which were the dominant TCR pair against MCC . These gp250-selected Vα11+Vβ3+ T cells also exhibited conserved MCC-reactive features , including the specific amino acid usages at CDR3 α91 and β97 . Our studies showed an ideal positively selecting self-peptide may be a key determinant to optimize immune response against a specific antigen , by enhancing the positive selection of good responders . 10 . 7554/eLife . 01457 . 013Figure 7 . The evolving concepts of the relationship between positively selecting self-peptide and post-selection T cell repertoire . The figures show the progress of our understanding about the relationship between thymic self-peptides and post-selection CD4+ T cell repertoire , and are arranged in chorological order . The first finding from late 90′ revealed that one positively selecting self-peptide was capable of selecting many different TCRs ( Ignatowicz et al . , 1996; Ignatowicz et al . , 1997; Liu et al . , 1997; Huseby et al . , 2005 ) . A few years later , Barton and Rudensky proposed that even though one self-peptide may select many TCRs , a diverse low abundant self-peptide repertoire is required to generate a full TCR repertoire ( Barton and Rudensky , 1999 ) . Subsequently , with the publication of a series of single chain mice , the model was further refined because even though the TCR repertoire selected by one single ligand was not reduced significantly enough to allow an visualization of a repertoire ‘hole’ , the postselection T cells in each single chain mouse showed different degrees of self-peptide reactivity in mixed lymphocyte culture ( Barton et al . , 2002 ) . These studies showed that a diverse collection of positively selecting self-peptides were necessary to generate a full T cell repertoire ( Barton and Rudensky , 1999; Barton et al . , 2002 ) . This present study involving the gp250 self-peptide showed increased frequency of Vα11+Vβ3+ CD4+ T cells with MCC-preferred CDR3 features in gp250 SC mice . The Vα11+Vβ3+ CD4+ T cells with specific CDR3 features were the dominant responders to promote MCC primary and memory responses . Therefore , gp250’s selecting capability provided a possible explanation to elucidate Vα11+ TCR-driven MCC immunodominance: a positively selecting self-peptide may favor the selection of TCR pairs and CDR3 features that were specific for MCC responses . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 01457 . 013 3 Discussion Immunodominance describes a common phenomenon of T cell immune responses . Yet the role of positive selection in immunodominance has not been established . In this study , we reported that CD4+ T cells specific for a defined antigen are positively selected by a common self-peptide . The self-peptide gp250 positively selected AND TCR , supporting our previous in vitro study ( Lo and Allen , 2013 ) , and also selected many other TCRs that have been reported as good MCC responders ( Hedrick et al . , 1988; McHeyzer-Williams et al . , 1999 ) . Our data reveal for the first time that positive selection may influence the TCR V ( D ) J preference and specific CDR3 junction sequences , and thus shape T cell response to a specific antigen . Our studies therefore offer direct evidence and a new perspective on how to generate a post-selection CD4+ T cell repertoire with desired antigen specificities , through engineering the positively selecting self-peptide . The gp250-selected CD4+ T cell repertoire analysis uncovered several very interesting results regarding the specificity of recognizing a positively selecting self-peptide , as well as the relationship between a positively selecting self-peptide and post-selection T cells . In the bulk population TCR repertoire analysis , the CDR3α was found for the well-characterized AND , 5c . c7 and 226 TCRs and also for the majority of published MCC-preferred clones . These findings suggested that one selecting ligand can select as many CDR3s with conserved features for specific antigen recognition as a full self-peptide repertoire could select . Previously , the Davis laboratory and we have shown in vitro that the self-peptide for AND and 5c . c7 TCRs were mutually exclusive with each other ( Ebert et al . , 2009; Lo and Allen , 2013 ) . The basis for why 5c . c7 was selected in vivo but not in vitro by gp250 probably reflects the relative inefficiency of the in vitro positively selecting assays . Our data suggest these strong MCC-reactive TCR clones may share a common positively selecting ligand , and support our hypothesis that positive selection may be the foundation of T cell immunodominance . Our finding that gp250 was sufficient to generate a reduced but still a large number of mature CD4+ T cells , with a full but skewed range of TCR usages , was similar to the observations in other single peptide mice , such as Eα- , CD22- , or Rab-mediated positive selection ( Ignatowicz et al . , 1996 , 1997; Barton and Rudensky , 1999; Barton et al . , 2002 ) ( Figure 7 ) . However , in those previously published studies , the specificity of post-selection repertoire was only examined at a cursorily level by stimulating the CD4+ T cells with random known antigens . The gp250 SC mice , however , successfully provided some key insights toward the relationship between positively selecting self-peptide and post-selection CD4+ T cells . Thanks to the well-studied MCC polyclonal T cell responses , we were thus able to discover some unique features of positive selection ( McHeyzer-Williams and Davis , 1995; McHeyzer-Williams et al . , 1999; Mikszta et al . , 1999; Malherbe et al . , 2004 ) . We found positively selecting self-peptide may favor some unique CDR3 features , which may serve as a good primary and memory responder toward a specific antigen in the periphery . Consistent with previous studies , the gp250 peptide was able to select a large number of CD4+ T cells . This observation makes sense when one considers that the number of selecting self-peptides presented in cortical thymic epithelial cells is smaller than the size of mature CD4+ T cell repertoire ( Lo and Allen , 2013 ) . Therefore , one positively selecting self-peptide has to select a large number of CD4+ T cell with diverse , unrelated antigen specificities , to be able to generate a full CD4+ T cell repertoire . The thymic development of regulatory T cells is also dependent upon self-peptides , and requires the strong interaction with these self-peptide MHC ligands ( Gottschalk et al . , 2010; Ohkura and Sakaguchi , 2010; Corse et al . , 2011; Ohkura et al . , 2013 ) . However , our preliminary analysis of CD25 expression of CD4SP in the gp250 SC mice did not reveal any significant differences from B6 . K mice . The comparable regulatory T cell frequencies in gp250 SC mice and B6 . K mice suggested that merely altering the self-peptide diversity was not sufficient to manipulate the affinity threshold for regulatory T cell selection . The finding was perhaps not surprising , given the potential TCR diversity through CDR3 recombination mechanism is nearly infinite , and both the TCR and the self-peptide determine the strength of interaction . Our data showed gp250 could select many different Vα11 TCRs . How could a peptide influence the selection of many different Vα chains , with a range of CDR3α sequences ? The general binding mode of TCR to pMHC has the CDR1 and CDR2 contacting the MHC , and the CDR3 contacting the peptide . One explanation comes from the crystal structure of the 226 TCR bound to MCC/I-Ek28 . The side chain of the Arg29 residue of the Vα11 CDR1 makes a hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl oxygen of the P3 residue ( Newell et al . , 2011 ) . Thus gp250 could position the P3 carbonyl oxygen ideally to form this hydrogen bond , and thus favoring Vα11 TCRs . Further structural studies will be needed to reveal the molecular basis of how a single peptide can select defined TCRs . 4 Materials and methods B6 . K ( H-2k ) ( JAX 001148 ) and B6 MHC class II−/− ( JAX 003584 ) mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory . The B6 CD75−/− mouse line was a gift from the Kappler/Marrack laboratory ( Bikoff et al . , 1995 ) . All mice were bred and housed in specific pathogen-free conditions of the animal facility at the Washington University Medical Center . All the use of laboratory animals was approved and done in accordance with the Washington University Division of Comparative Medicine guidelines . Fluorescence-conjugated antibodies from commercial sources were as follows: fluorescein isothiocyanate- , allophycocyanin- or allophycocyanin–indodicarbocyanine-conjugated anti-CD4 ( GK1 . 5; BioLegend , San Diego , CA ) ; phycoerythrin–indodicarbocyanine-conjugated anti-CD8 ( 53-6 . 7; BioLegend ) ; fluorescein isothiocyanate- , or phycoerythrin-conjugated I-Ek ( 17-3-3; BioLegend ) ; allophycocyanin- or phycoerythrin–cy7-conjugated anti-CD69 ( 1-11 . 2F3; BioLegend ) ; LIVE/DEAD Fixable Blue Dead Cell Stain ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) ; or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated or biotinylated anti-Vα11 ( RR8-1; BD Pharmingen , Franklin Lakes , NJ ) . Antibodies against the panel of TCR Vβ chains were purchased from BD Pharmingen ( 557004 ) . All samples were analyzed on a FACSCalibur , FACSLSRII , or FACSAria ( BD ) and data were analyzed with FlowJo software ( TreeStar , Ashland , OR ) . We used a construct based on the hemoglobin peptide ( Hb64–76 ) covalently linked to the I-Ek β chain with a flexible linker ( a generous gift of J Kappler ) . We replaced the hemoglobin DNA sequences with the gp250 peptide by PCR to create the gp250/I-Ekβ construct . The gp250/I-Ek construct was subsequently subcloned into the EcoRI sites of pDOI-5 vector . A BglI linearized fragment was isolated and used to inject the pronuclei of fertilized B6 oocytes to obtain the gp250/I-Ek mouse . We screened 374 mice and obtained one founder . The founder was crossed to I-Ek α chain transgenic mice ( Griffiths et al . , 1994 ) , and subsequently bred onto the MHCII−/− and CD74−/− background . All of the experiments reported here used the gp250 single chain mice on MHCII−/− and CD74−/− background . Thymocytes or splenocytes from gp250 SC mice or B6 . K mice were stained with a panel of FITC-conjugated antibodies against a panel of antibodies against mouse TCR Vβ chains ( 557004; BD Pharmingen ) , along with APC-CD4 , PE-Vα11 , and APC-Cy7-CD8 . APC-labeled I-Ek tetramers in complex with MCC , or CLIP were obtained from the NIH facility . All washes and incubations were done in modified RPMI-1640 containing 2% FCS and 0 . 075% sodium bicarbonate . For tetramer staining , peripheral CD4+ T cells were enriched by CD4+ MACS beads ( Miltenyi Biotech , Germany ) , and CD4SP thymocytes were enriched by negative selection of CD8+ MACS beads ( Miltenyi Biotech ) . Enriched CD4+ peripheral T cells or CD4SP thymocytes were stained with APC-conjugated MCC tetramer or PE-conjugated Hb tetramer on ice for about 1 . 5–2 hr . The APC-conjugated or PE-conjugated CLIP tetramers were used as a negative control . In the case of MCC tetramer staining , the cells were also stained for APC/Cy7-conjugated CD4 , PE/Cy7-conjugated CD8 , and Pacific blue-conjugated CD3 antibodies . Cells positive for LIVE/DEAD Fixable Blue Dead Cell Stain were gated out of the analysis . B6 . K or gp250 SC hematopoietic stem cells were enriched by c-kit MicroBeads ( #130-091-224; Miltenyi Biotech ) , stained for c-kit and Sca-1 , and sorted out c-kit+Sca-1+ population on an AriaII . Hematopoietic stem cells were resuspended at 104 cells per 50 µl PBS and were adoptively transferred into lethally irradiated B6 . K or gp250 SC mice by retro-orbital injection on day 0 ( at least 104 hematopoietic stem cells per mouse ) . After a 12-week of reconstitution , cells were recovered from thymus and spleen of each recipient mouse , and analyzed by flow cytometry . The single cell repertoire analysis was conducted by following the protocol developed by McHezyer-William’s lab ( McHeyzer-Williams et al . , 1999 ) . Single peripheral Vα11+Vβ3+CD3+CD4+CD8− cells from gp250 SC mice were sorted into a 96-well plate on Aria II . Each single cell was sorted into the center 60 wells with the first and last well of each row serving as a negative control . Each single cell was directly sorted into a well containing 5 μl of reaction mixture: 1× Cell Direct Reaction Buffer ( 11753-100; Invitrogen ) , 0 . 1 μl SuperScript-III RT/Platinum Taq Mix ( 11753-100; Invitrogen ) , and 2 . 5 nM external primers ( Va11 .

After the single cell sort , the plate was immediately held at 50°C for 15 min , followed by 95°C for 2 min , and then 22 cycles of 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 4 min for cDNA reaction . The cDNA products were diluted to 20 μl with molecular-grade water , and 2 μl of the first round product was used for further 10 μl amplification for TCR Vα11 and Vβ3 as previously described with the Internal Primers .

The first round and second round PCR reaction were prepared and conducted at a separate bench in the lab where no AND transgenic TCR-related experiments had been previously done . After the PCR amplication , 4 μl PCR products were run on 2% and screened for the single positive bands of the right sizes . PCR products were then TOPO cloned to pCR2 . 1 vectors , and prepared for sequencing . The sequencing primers were as previously described ( McHeyzer-Williams and Davis , 1995; McHeyzer-Williams et al . , 1999 ) . The peripheral Vα11+Vβ3+ , Vα11+ Vβ6+ , Vα11+ Vβ14+ CD4+ cells from B6 . K or gp250 SC mice were stained and sorted on an Aria II . For TCR CDR3α analysis , RNA was isolated and used to generate cDNA as described ( Lathrop et al . , 2011 ) . A bulk Vα11 cDNA library was generated by PCR using primers derived from published studies ( Dash et al . , 2011 ) and then sequenced using Illumina MiSeq technology at the Washington University Genome Sequencing Center . For TCR CDR3β repertoire , the bulk-sorted populations were pelleted at 400×g for 10 min and snap-frozen on dry ice . The prepared cell pellets were sent to Adaptive Biotechnologies for conducting bulk CDR3β analysis . The CDR3 amino acid usages were analyzed in Excel . All data were analyzed nonparametrically by the Mann-Whitney U-test or paired t tests with Prism 6 software ( Graph Pad ) . p values of less than 0 . 05 were considered significant ."}

Different types of touch receptors respond in different ways when we grasp and manipulate objects; for example , by altering the strength of their response or its timing . Saal et al . have now investigated how neurons in a part of the brain called the somatosensory cortex , which processes touch signals from the hand , respond to the information from the different receptor types . First , recordings were made of the electrical activity of the touch receptors and the neurons in the brain of monkeys . Using this data , Saal et al . built computer models that allow the response of neurons in the brain to be predicted from the responses of the touch receptors . The models showed that signals from different types of touch receptors shape the response of neurons in the brain in different ways . One receptor type controls how strong a neuron’s response will be , while another one controls the precise timing of the response . Further investigation revealed that this way of combining the signals from the different receptors preserves as much information as possible about objects and thereby helps the brain to process information acquired by touch quickly and efficiently . Future experiments will examine how touch is represented in two structures that lie between the receptors and the somatosensory cortex: one in the brainstem , the other in a brain region called the thalamus .", "article": "1 Introduction Perception reflects the seamless integration of signals from a variety of sensory receptors that respond preferentially to different aspects of the environment . The classic example of such integration is color vision , where input from different cone receptors is integrated to extract a specific feature of objects , approximately corresponding to their absorption spectrum ( Gegenfurtner , 2003 ) . Signals are also combined across different sensory modalities , and this integration process is often optimized to extract stimulus information ( Ernst and Banks , 2002 ) . Given that different sensory channels encode different stimulus features and exhibit different response properties , the central nervous system is faced with the challenge of how to integrate such disparate input signals . The sense of touch is mediated by at least three main classes of mechanoreceptive afferents , each of which responds to different aspects of skin deformation ( Johnson , 2001 ) : slowly-adapting type I ( SA1 ) afferents are most sensitive at low frequencies ( <10 Hz ) , rapidly adapting ( RA ) afferents at intermediate frequencies ( in the so-called flutter range , from 10 to 50 Hz ) , and Pacinian ( PC ) afferents at high-frequencies ( peaking in sensitivity at around 250 Hz ) . However , the frequency sensitivities of the different afferent classes overlap considerably ( Figure 1A ) , and natural stimuli typically engage more than one class ( Saal and Bensmaia , 2014 ) . Not surprisingly , then , information about most tactile events is carried by signals from several afferent classes ( Saal and Bensmaia , 2014; Johansson and Flanagan , 2009; Abraira and Ginty , 2013 ) , and this input is integrated across submodalities even at the first stage of cortical processing , namely primary somatosensory cortex ( S1 ) ( Pei et al . , 2009; Carter et al . , 2014 ) . Importantly , S1 neurons convey information about contacted objects not only in the strength of their responses but also in their timing ( Harvey et al . , 2013; Zuo et al . , 2015 ) . For example , the amplitude of skin oscillations—such as those elicited during the exploration of textured surfaces—is encoded in the strength of the cortical response whereas their frequency is encoded in its timing . To achieve such multiplexing requires that afferent signals be integrated in a principled way . 10 . 7554/eLife . 10450 . 003Figure 1 . Characterizing the transformation between peripheral and cortical responses . ( A ) Frequency–amplitude pairs that elicit responses in rapidly adapting ( RA ) and Pacinian ( PC ) afferents . Light blue and orange lines indicate absolute response thresholds for RA and PC afferents ( as determined by the peripheral model ) , respectively , while the dark blue and orange lines denote tuning thresholds ( i . e . , eliciting one spike on each stimulus cycle ) . The black line corresponds to the highest amplitude the stimulator could deliver at a given frequency and likely exceeds the maximum amplitude that one is liable to encounter during every day tactile experience . While RA and PC afferents are maximally sensitive at different frequencies , most frequency–amplitude pairs elicit responses from both afferent classes ( indicated by the shaded region ) .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 10450 . 005 Here , we measure the responses of S1 neurons to a wide variety of simple and complex vibrotactile stimuli and reconstruct the responses of afferent populations to these same stimuli . We then implement a simple model that allows us to examine how responses of the different afferent populations combine to drive responses in cortex . First , we find that most S1 neurons integrate information from multiple afferent classes . Second , signals from the different classes drive cortical responses in very different ways: RA afferent input exerts an excitatory influence on S1 responses and is the primary determinant of their firing rates; in contrast , PC input exerts a balanced excitatory and inhibitory influence which sharpens the timing of cortical responses without having a major impact on the rates . Finally , we show that the process of integration maximizes information transmission across the range of stimulation conditions that might be encountered during everyday interactions with objects . 2 Results We found that most cortical neurons in areas 3b and 1 receive input from both RA and PC afferents , as evidenced by the significant contribution of both to the overall prediction ( Figure 2A ) . Furthermore , the linear filters obtained for each afferent population , while similar across cortical neurons , were consistently different from each other ( Figure 2B ) : First , while the magnitude of the PC filters was correlated with that of the RA filters ( r = 0 . 41 ) , PC filters were consistently of lower magnitude ( Figure 2C , t ( 70 ) = 6 . 4 , p < 0 . 01 , paired t-test ) , with the RA contribution on average about three times stronger than the PC one . Second , RA filters were much more extended in time ( with a mean above 30 ms ) than were PC filters ( with a mean below 20 ms ) ( Figure 2D , t ( 188 ) = 9 . 6 , p < 0 . 01 , two-sample t-test ) . Third , while the net contribution of the RA input to the cortical response was positive , PC input was on average balanced; that is , excitatory and suppressive components of the PC filters were of equal magnitude . In fact , for about half of cortical neurons , the PC contribution was net suppressive ( Figure 2E ) ; the difference in the net contribution of RA and PC input was significant ( t ( 188 ) = 16 . 1 , p < 0 . 01 , two-sample t-test ) . PC filters were also much more diverse and spanned the range of this metric ( from -1 to +1 ) , in contrast to RA filters , which , as mentioned above , tended to be net excitatory ( >0 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 10450 . 006Figure 2 .

( E ) Excitation indices for all RA and PC filters , where 1 denotes purely excitatory input , 0 balanced input , and -1 purely suppressive input .

( E ) Comparison of differences reported between RA and PC filters ( grey bars ) as reported in the main text ( cf . Figure 2 ) and biases when calculating the same metrics from the simulated neuronal responses ( red bars ) . In all cases , any biases are much smaller than the reported effects and are therefore unlikely to affect the results reported in Figure 2 . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 10450 . 007 The different filter shapes for RA and PC input reflect profound differences in the way the two afferent populations shape cortical responses . Indeed , the firing rates of individual S1 neurons are almost entirely determined by RA input as evidenced by the fact that a model based on RA input alone can predict S1 firing rates—averaged over 1 s long periods—almost as well as RA and PC responses combined; this was true for responses to both noise and sinusoids ( Figure 3 ) . PC input alone , on the other hand , cannot account for the observed cortical firing rates . Indeed , these would be much more frequency-dependent if driven by this population of nerve fibers . 10 . 7554/eLife . 10450 . 008Figure 3 . Rapidly adapting ( RA ) input determines cortical firing rates . Reconstruction accuracy of the full model compared to one that includes only RA or Pacinian ( PC ) input as measured by correlation between actual and predicted firing rates ( measured over the duration of the trial , namely 1 s ) . Error bars denote the standard error of the mean across neurons . Firing rates elicited by both noise and sinusoidal stimuli are well predicted by the full model . While the performance of RA-only filters is almost as good as the full model , reconstruction accuracy drops dramatically if only PC input is included . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 10450 . 008 We have previously shown that the responses of mechanoreceptive afferents are highly precise and repeatable , and their timing conveys information about the frequency composition of skin vibrations ( Mackevicius et al . , 2012 ) and about the identity of textures scanned across the skin ( Weber et al . , 2013 ) at resolutions on the order of milliseconds . Similarly , the temporal patterning of responses in somatosensory cortex is precise and informative down to a millisecond timescale ( Harvey et al . , 2013 ) . RA and PC input are thus integrated in such a way to culminate in temporally patterned cortical responses . One might expect that the shorter integration window of the PC filters combined with their strong suppressive components would result in this sensory channel driving more precise spike timing than does its RA counterpart . Indeed , when removing the PC contribution from the model , predictions of spike timing in the cortex became less temporally precise ( Figure 4A ) . We quantified this effect in two ways . First , we filtered the recorded and predicted time-varying firing rates to noise stimuli at different temporal resolutions and examined how much of the variance in the responses could be accounted for based on RA input or PC input alone ( Figure 4B ) . We found that only PC input can account for high frequency fluctuations in the cortical responses of many neurons , while RA input is sufficient at coarser temporal resolutions for almost all cortical neurons ( Figure 4C ) . In fact , the more precise the responses of a cortical neuron were , the more of its response variance was explained by PC input ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) . Second , we tested how well the model could account for the well-documented patterning in cortical responses to sinusoidal vibrations: over a wide range of frequencies , cortical neurons produce entrained responses to sinusoidal stimulation of the skin ( Harvey et al . , 2013; Salinas et al . , 2000; Mountcastle et al . , 1969 ) . That is , they produce one spike or burst of spikes within a very restricted phase of each stimulus cycle . We examined , then , whether we could predict the degree of entrainment of cortical neurons to sinusoidal stimuli from the RA and PC input . We found that the strength of phase-locking to sinusoids ranging in frequency from 50 to 300 Hz was well captured by the model ( yielding a correlation between predicted and measured phase-locking of 0 . 78 ) . Importantly , while RA input was dominant at the low frequencies , only the PC input could account for the observed phase-locking at 200 Hz and above ( Figure 4D ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 10450 . 009Figure 4 . Precise spike timing of S1 neurons is driven by Pacinian ( PC ) input . ( A ) Responses to noise stimuli from two example neurons with particularly precise responses . Spiking probabilities derived from the full model ( green traces ) are much more temporally precise than are those derived from a rapidly adapting ( RA ) -only model ( blue traces ) , reflecting the importance of PC input in shaping the response at fine timescales . Five repetitions of the recorded cortical spike trains are shown below the model traces in black . ( B ) Fraction of the explained variance ( R2 ) by either the RA ( blue ) or PC ( orange ) model relative to the full model across different temporal resolutions for the two neurons shown in A . PC input is important to explain responses on fine timescales . ( C ) Fraction of explained variance ( R2 fraction ) relative to the full model by RA and PC input for all neurons at two different temporal resolutions . While RA input can explain most of the observed variance at coarse temporal resolutions ( left panel ) , PC input is needed to explain the timing of cortical responses at fine temporal resolutions ( right panel ) . See Figure 4—figure supplement 1 for further analysis . ( D ) Vector strengths predicted by RA ( blue ) and PC ( orange ) models relative to their measured counterparts at different frequencies across all neurons . RA input accounts for entrainment to sinusoidal stimuli at low frequencies , while PC input is needed at higher frequencies .

Fraction of variance explained as a function of timing precision of cortical neurons . Fraction of variance explained by the RA-only model as a function of neural timing precision ( as assessed by the highest frequency , the neurons reliably phase-locked ) for two different bin sizes . At coarse temporal resolution , RA input explains almost all variance explained by the model independent of whether the neuron's spiking was precise or not . At fine temporal resolutions , RA input alone cannot explain the model's performance . The more precise a neuron's response , the less RA input alone could account for its response , indicating that the PC input accounts for more precise cortical responses . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 10450 . 010 Having established how input from different sensory channels is integrated in somatosensory cortex , we sought to understand why the two channels drive cortical neurons in different ways . We reasoned that the process of integration should reflect differences in the response properties of the input channels . Specifically , PC responses to skin vibrations and scanned textures have been consistently shown to be more temporally precise than their RA counterparts ( Weber et al . , 2013; Mackevicius et al . , 2012 ) . Furthermore , the two afferent classes differ in their frequency sensitivity profile: PC afferents are considerably more sensitive than RA afferents at frequencies above about 150 Hz ( see Figure 1A ) . Finally , we surmised that the process of integration would also reflect the statistics of the stimuli experienced during interactions with objects , as is the case in other sensory modalities ( van Hateren , 1992; Field , 1987; Smith and Lewicki , 2006 ) . We focused on natural textures , which are ideally suited to address this question . When running our finger across a textured surface , high-frequency oscillations are elicited in the skin ( BensmaÏa and Hollins , 2003; 2005; Manfredi et al . , 2014 ) , which in turn elicit highly temporally patterned and repeatable responses in both RA and PC afferents ( Weber et al . , 2013 ) . In cortex , neurons respond to skin oscillations with precisely timed spikes that encode the skin deflections with millisecond precision ( Harvey et al . , 2013 ) . In light of this , how should RA and PC responses to natural tactile stimuli be integrated to be maximally informative about texture-elicited skin oscillations at a fine temporal resolution ? To address this question , we simulated RA and PC responses to different textures scanned across the skin and optimized cortical RA and PC filters for information transmission about skin oscillations . We found that the filters optimized to convey information about texture closely matched the filters derived from measured S1 responses: RA filters were mostly excitatory and temporally broad; PC filters were narrower and comprised distinct suppressive components ( Figure 5A ) . The similarities between the recorded and optimized filters also held up quantitatively . First , we found that most ( 71% ) optimized filters comprised contribution from both RA and PC fibers , while the rest relied on RA input alone , similar to what we found in our cortical data set . Second , we found that the optimal filters typically weighted the RA input more strongly than the PC input , as did the filters derived from cortical responses ( Figure 5B ) . Third , the optimal RA filter widths were wider than PC filter widths and largely overlapped the range of the actual filter widths ( Figure 5C ) . Finally , we found that the excitation/suppression indices of the optimized filters approximated those derived from our cortical data set in that RA input was always net excitatory , while PC input spanned the range between highly suppressive , balanced , and excitatory ( Figure 5D ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 10450 . 011Figure 5 . Rapidly adapting ( RA ) and Pacinian ( PC ) input is integrated optimally . ( A ) Three examples RA and PC filters , each optimized for a different natural texture ( colored traces ) and paired with a filter from a cortical neuron that most closely matches it ( gray traces ) . ( B–D ) Comparison of filter statistics for actual ( black ) and optimized ( lavender ) , and distorted ( green ) filters for the RA/PC magnitude ratio ( B ) , filter width ( C ) , and excitation/suppression index ( D ) . For the optimized filters , bars denote the range covered by the filters optimized for different textures . For the actual filters , bars indicate the range between the 10th and the 90th percentile . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 10450 . 011 To test whether our fitted and optimized filters might be an artifact of our approach rather than reflect the integration properties of S1 neurons , we also optimized filters on a distorted data set . During natural interaction with surfaces , the amplitude of elicited vibrations decreases as their frequency increases , leading to roughly a power–law relationship ( Manfredi et al . , 2014; Wiertlewski et al . , 2011; Delhaye et al . , 2012 ) . When we re-optimized the filters to stimuli with a distorted frequency composition , we found that the resulting filters did not match the ones observed in cortex ( green bars in Figure 5B–D ) : The PC signal was weighted more heavily , was integrated over longer timescales , and was mostly excitatory , in contrast to what we observed in both the cortical filters and the ones optimized on our natural texture data set . We conclude that RA and PC integration in S1 is optimized to encode stimuli that are commonly encountered during interactions with objects . 3 Discussion Our results unequivocally show that RA and PC input are integrated in the responses of individual S1 neurons . That is , the responses of S1 neurons cannot be explained from the responses of RA or PC neurons alone . While it has traditionally been assumed that the different tactile submodalities are segregated at least through primary somatosensory cortex ( Sur et al . , 1981; Sur et al . , 1984; Chen et al . , 2001; Friedman et al . , 2004 ) ( although cortical PC neurons have generally proven elusive , see below ) , recent evidence suggests that input from different classes of somatosensory afferents is indeed integrated between periphery and cortex ( Saal and Bensmaia , 2014; Pei et al . , 2009; Carter et al . , 2014; Prescott et al . , 2014 ) . In this study , stimuli fell in the range of frequencies that excites RA and PC fibers at the exclusion of SA1 fibers , which only respond to low-frequency stimulation . However , SA1 and RA input have been shown to be integrated in the responses of S1 neurons when these were studied with ramp-and-hold skin indentations ( Pei et al . , 2009 ) so the convergence of submodality-specific input onto individual S1 neurons seems to be a general phenomenon . However , it is still an open question whether the integration of input from different mechanoreceptors takes place only at the cortical level , or whether they appear already at the subcortical level in either the cuneate nucleus or the thalamus . Convergence of somatosensory submodalities has been observed in the brainstem of rats ( Sakurai et al . , 2013 ) and the same is likely true in primates . Our results reconcile some seemingly contradictory findings regarding the contribution of PC afferents to cortical responses . First , vibrotactile coding in general and the role of PC input specifically have been probed almost exclusively with high-frequency sinusoidal stimuli . These stimuli have been shown to evoke only a short transient response in S1 , which then quickly decays back to baseline , a phenomenon that can be accounted for by the balance of excitation and suppression in the PC drive . That PC-elicited responses are short and weak might explain why PC-driven cortical neurons are thought to be extremely rare in S1 ( Lebedev and Nelson , 1996; Mountcastle et al . , 1990 ) . Second , the main effect of PC input is to shape the timing of cortical spikes , which could account for the extremely precise timing of S1 responses at high frequencies ( Harvey et al . , 2013 ) that has been shown to contribute to tactile perception ( Zuo et al . , 2015 ) . Third , the balanced drive of PC afferents explains why the firing rates of S1 neurons are not dependent on stimulus frequency even though PC rates are ( Harvey et al . , 2013 ) . Finally , the PC input has been found to inhibit cortical responses ( Tommerdahl et al . , 2005; Tommerdahl et al . , 2010 ) , consistent with our finding that PC filters are often net suppressive . Sensory cortex is tuned to the statistics of the natural environment , as has been demonstrated most notably in vision ( van Hateren , 1992; Field , 1987 ) and audition ( Smith and Lewicki , 2006 ) , by invoking the efficient coding principle ( Barlow et al . , 1961 ) . Generally , it has been assumed that the peripheral input stems from a single homogeneous population of neurons ( e . g . retinal ganglion cells ) . However , this is often not the case: in touch , information is carried by multiple separate populations of neurons , each with different sensitivities and response properties . To encode information efficiently , then , the disparate response properties of these different channels need to be taken into account . While both RA and PC afferents respond to most high-frequency skin vibrations , such as those elicited during texture scanning , both afferent classes do so in different ways . First , RA afferents increase their firing rate with increasing stimulus amplitudes ( Arabzadeh et al . , 2014 ) , and do so in a manner that is relatively independent of stimulus frequency , while PC responses saturate at low stimulus amplitudes and are highly frequency-dependent ( Muniak et al . , 2007 ) . RA firing rates therefore convey a much more informative signal about the amplitude of tactile stimuli than do PC firing rates . That S1 firing rates depend mostly on RA input exploits the fact that these afferents convey unambiguous information about stimulus amplitude . Second , PC afferents exhibit much higher temporal precision in their spiking patterns than do RA afferents ( Mackevicius et al . , 2012 ) , especially for high-frequency skin vibrations such as those elicited when we run our fingers across a texture ( Weber et al . , 2013 ) , and this precise spike timing conveys information about tactile events and shapes perception ( Mackevicius et al . , 2012 ) . That the timing of S1 responses is driven primarily by the PC input exploits the highly informative nature of the PC timing signal . Separate sensory channels that convey complementary but overlapping information are commonplace in sensory systems and not limited to the sense of touch; the visual ( Field and Chichilnisky , 2007 ) , auditory ( Cant and Benson , 2003 ) , gustatory ( Zhang et al . , 2003 ) , olfactory ( Uchida et al . , 2014 ) , and vestibular ( Goldberg , 2000; Sadeghi et al . , 2007 ) systems all involve many types of afferents . Distributing sensory information across channels has distinct advantages such as parsing the behaviorally relevant range ( Dominy and Lucas , 2001 ) , keeping energy expenditure low ( Gjorgjieva et al . , 2014 ) , and optimizing information transmission in the presence of noise ( Kastner et al . , 2015 ) . To the extent that these parallel input channels represent information in disparate ways ( differing in response latency , adaptation properties , or spiking precision , among others ) , their integration should reflect and exploit such differences , a process that can be described using the type of model introduced here . 4 Materials and methods The vibrotactile stimuli have been described previously , for both the peripheral ( Muniak et al . , 2007 ) and the cortical ( Harvey et al . , 2013 ) experiments . In short , tactile stimuli were delivered to the distal pads of the digits using a stainless steel probe diameter driven by a shaker motor . The shaker motor was calibrated before each experimental run such that stimuli were highly accurate and repeatable . We delivered three types of stimuli that varied in spectral complexity , including simple sinusoids , diharmonic stimuli ( only used for the peripheral model fitting ) , and bandpass noise . The ranges of frequencies and amplitudes spanned the range experienced in everyday tactile experience . While the exact frequencies and amplitudes differed somewhat between the peripheral and cortical data sets , the two stimulus sets were largely overlapping . We were thus able to develop peripheral spiking models that simulated the peripheral responses to the stimuli used in the cortical data set ( see below ) . Individual stimuli in this data set were 1 s long and were repeated five times ( frozen noise ) , yielding a total of about 22 minutes ( 16 for noise and 6 for the sinusoids ) of data from each neuron . We fit integrate-and-fire ( IF ) models to the measured responses of individual afferents . Our IF model is similar to an earlier one ( Kim et al . , 2010 ) , with two main differences . First , we did not employ complex temporal filters with a large number of weights , but instead restricted the model input to six dimensions ( positive and negative rectified stimulus positions , velocities and accelerations ) plus a delay parameter , as this parameterization has been shown to be sufficient to reproduce afferent responses ( Dong et al . , 2013 ) . Second , we included an additional parameter , namely a smoothing factor that controls the width of a Gaussian window that is convolved with the stimulus trace initially . Using this parameter allows us to model the fact that the PC afferents’ sensitivity decreases for frequencies higher than ~300 Hz ( Muniak et al . , 2007; Mountcastle et al . , 1972 ) . For model fitting , we used the van Rossum spike distance ( van Rossum , 2001 ) between the recorded and model-predicted responses as a cost function and then optimized the model parameters using the patternsearch function in Matlab ( The Mathworks , Inc . , Natick , MA ) using different starting positions . We optimized the model on the noise stimuli first and then alternated between the sinusoidal and diharmonic stimulus sets while decreasing the cost function time constant until the fits did not improve further . In total , we fit single afferent models to 14 RA and 4 PC afferents . RA and PC population responses were generated by averaging over the responses of all RA and PC individual models , respectively . The models have been extensively validated , as detailed in previous studies ( Kim et al . , 2010; Dong et al . , 2013 ) , and captured both the strength and timing of peripheral afferents ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . One potential concern is that the reconstructed RA and PC population activity might not accurately reflect the peripheral input on which a given cortical neuron's response relies . While individual peripheral responses are very stereotyped and therefore simple to model , individual afferents still differ in terms of sensitivity , and these differences might be reflected in the cortical responses . To address this issue , we generated different RA and PC populations , using different peripheral models , and also varied the size of the peripheral population used to drive the cortical responses . We found that the recovered filters were robust to these changes . We modeled the transformation between the peripheral RA and PC population responses and single unit S1 responses using the LNP framework ( Schwartz et al . , 2006 ) . LNP models have long been fruitfully used for modeling the responses of cortical neurons across several synapses , often even including the sensory receptors . The model describes the process of integration as follows: First , the peripheral RA and PC population responses are each convolved with a linear filter . Second , the resulting responses are summed and rectified to yield time-varying spiking probabilities . Third , spike trains are generated according to the spiking probability in each time bin . The full model ( see also Figure 1B ) can thus be expressed as follows: ( 1 ) p ( st ) =r ( kRA×sRA , t+kPC×sPC , t ) where p ( st ) denotes the probability of a cortical spike at time t , kRA and kPC are vectors containing the RA and PC filters , sRA , t and sPC , t are vectors containing the binned RA and PC population responses within a time window 100 ms prior to time t , and r ( ) denotes the rectifying nonlinearity . To estimate the linear filters kRA and kPC , we used reverse correlation of the cortical responses onto the RA and PC z-scored population responses covering a time window of 100 ms preceding the cortical response with a bin width of 1 ms . For this procedure , we exclusively used the data from the bandpass noise stimuli as this method can only recover unbiased filters if the RA and PC population responses are uncorrelated with each other over time . Even though our original vibrotactile stimuli exhibited little autocorrelation , the evoked RA and PC population responses were weakly correlated both across time and with each other , which could affect the filter estimation . We addressed this problem using a two-pronged approach . First , we verified that across our entire data set , temporal and population correlations were low ( see below ) . Second , to minimize the impact of any remaining correlations , we calculated the autocorrelation matrix of the RA and PC population input and used its regularized inverse to correct the obtained filters ( ridge regression ) : ( 2 ) kRA , PC=[STRA , PC , T×SRA , PC , T+a*I]-1×STRA , PC , T×sC , where kRA , PC , T is a vector containing both the RA and PC filters , SRA , PC , T is a matrix where each row corresponds to a time t and contains the peripheral population responses sRA and sPC for the 100 ms preceding t , a is the regularization parameter , I is the identity matrix , sC is a binary vector containing the responses of a cortical neuron ( 0 for no spike , 1 for spike ) for all times t , and []-1 denotes the pseudoinverse . We varied the regularization parameter a and also tried other correction methods , such as decomposing the autocorrelation matrix using singular-value-decomposition and only preserving strong components ( Sripati et al . , 2006 ) ; we obtained essentially the same results , and thus conclude that the approach is robust and the recovered linear filters accurate ( see further analysis below ) . The nonlinearity was a piecewise linear function , chosen over a smoother sigmoidal function , because the firing rates of S1 neurons increase steeply as soon as their respective response threshold is crossed ( Harvey et al . , 2013 ) : ( 3 ) r ( x ) =b1 , if x<0 , r ( x ) =b1+b2*x , if x>0 and b1+b2*x<1 , and r ( x ) =1 , otherwise . To estimate the parameters b1 and b2 , we used an optimization algorithm ( lsqcurvefit in Matlab ) to fit the time-varying spiking probabilities p ( st ) such that they matched the observed spiking probabilities to the extent possible . To measure the magnitude of a filter , we summed its absolute value over time . To determine the temporal width of a filter , we first determined a noise threshold , set to three times the standard deviation of the filter values 80–100 ms before the cortical response; we then counted the total time that each filter’s absolute value was above that threshold . Finally , to measure excitation/suppression indices , we divided the sum of the positive and negative components of a filter by its overall magnitude . When analyzing the impact of removing input from one fiber class , we refitted the filters and nonlinearity using only input from the remaining class . Recovering linear filters accurately from data that exhibit correlations is notoriously difficult and error prone . In our case , one of the main concerns is whether cross-correlations between RA and PC responses might introduce biases in the recovered filters that would lead us to conclude that both populations contribute input , when in reality only one does . Additionally , the RA and PC responses are autocorrelated , which might bias our estimates of the filter width , or their net excitation or suppression , and thereby erroneously yield different filters for the two populations ( see Figure 2—figure supplement 1A for the RA/PC covariance matrix ) . To test whether our method is prone to such biases , we simulated a population of 243 neurons with a variety of different linear filters that differed in width , magnitude , excitation/suppression , temporal offset , and received RA input , PC input , or both . We then used these filters to generate simulated spiking data from the noise vibrations . We set the firing rates to span the range encountered in the measured cortical responses . We then tested whether we could accurately recover the linear filters from the simulated responses and whether there were any biases in the measures we used to quantify these filters . First , we found that the recovered filters matched the filters used to generate the simulated data well ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1B , C ) . Second , we verified that our procedure for determining whether neurons received RA input , PC input , or both , worked correctly in the vast majority of cases: 90% of the simulated neurons that received input from both RA and PC populations were identified as such . Importantly , only 3% of simulated neurons that received input from only one of the peripheral populations were misclassified as receiving input from both ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1D ) . Finally , we also checked whether there might be biases when estimating filter metrics such as overall magnitude , filter width , and excitation/suppression indices in RA as compared to PC filters that might explain the observed differences . We found that these biases were generally very small and in no case could account for the effect sizes observed in the cortical data set ( see comparison in Figure 2—figure supplement 1E ) . In summary , our procedure recovers most filter shapes accurately and the small biases that remain cannot account for the observed effect sizes . To assess the contribution of RA and PC input at different timescales , we bandpass-filtered the measured and predicted cortical responses to four different frequency ranges , corresponding to different temporal resolutions ( 3 , 5 , 13 , and 66 ms ) and then calculated the correlation coefficients for each neuron . To assess spike timing for the sinusoidal data set , we calculated the vector strength ( Goldberg and Brown , 1969 ) ( a measure of how precisely a neuron’s response is aligned with a sinusoidal stimulus ) of the recorded and predicted cortical responses . We first simulated the responses of populations of RA and PC fibers to 55 natural textures ( Manfredi et al . , 2014 ) . In brief , textured surfaces were scanned over the fingertip of human subjects at different scanning speeds , while elicited vibrations were recorded using a Laser Doppler vibrometer ( Polytec OFV-3001 with OFV 311 sensor head , Polytec , Inc . , Irvine , CA ) . For each texture , we collected 240 ( 8 subjects × 3 speeds × 10 repetitions ) 500-ms long vibration traces . The recorded traces were bandpass-filtered to between 50 and 800 Hz and then served as input to the peripheral RA and PC spiking models . To adjust for the distance-dependent decay of the vibrations and the size of the contact location , we added a global scaling factor for each the RA and PC traces which was set to ensure that the mean simulated RA and PC firing rates matched those recorded using the same set of textures ( Weber et al . , 2013 ) . Indeed , across textures the recorded and simulated firing rates matched well ( r = 0 . 83 for RA and r = 0 . 92 for PC responses ) , indicating that our simulated responses capture actual texture-elicited responses well . Some textures , mainly coarser one , elicit responses not only in RA and PC afferents , but also in SA1 afferents; we excluded textures with an average SA1 contribution >10 Hz from further analysis . Since we were interested in tactile environments that cause both RA and PC afferents to respond , we also excluded textures where the RA or PC average firing rate was below 20 Hz . In total , this left 25 textures , whose elicited vibrations where in the high-frequency range and excited RA and PC but not SA1 afferents . Next , we optimized linear filters for each texture individually by maximizing the mutual information I ( S , V ) between the responses of our model ( S ) and the texture-elicited vibration traces ( V ) : ( 4 ) I ( S , V ) =∑S∑V p ( s , v ) log [p ( s , v ) /p ( s ) p ( v ) ] The probability of a spike in an S1 neuron , p ( s ) , can be calculated from the LNP model described above . To estimate p ( v ) , that is , the distribution of stimulus values , we divided the stimulus trace into 1 ms long bins and calculated the absolute value of the deflection amplitude at each time point . The resulting values were divided into 50 bins and p ( v ) was set to the relative frequencies with which each of the 50 values appeared . We introduced a delay of 15 ms to mimic the response delays observed in cortical responses . For optimization , we calculated the gradient of the mutual information I ( S , V ) analytically and then used a standard constrained optimization method ( fmincon in Matlab ) . We restricted the average firing probability , Σt p ( st ) /T , of the optimized neurons to values observed in our recorded data set to prevent neurons from responding at unnaturally high rates ( Tkacik et al . , 2010 ) . We found that filters optimized for different firing rates differed in a scale factor , but were otherwise identical . We also used a constant set of parameters for the static nonlinearity; again , we found that these did not affect the shape of the optimized filters but rather changed their scale . Finally , we ran our procedure for filter optimization on a distorted data set . Specifically , we numerically computed the second derivative ( accelerations ) of the original texture traces described above and re-normalized them to the magnitude of the original traces before simulating peripheral responses to these stimuli and then optimizing the filters . The differentiated traces contain the same frequencies as the original traces , but the higher frequencies are weighted more strongly ."}

Health agencies often try to reduce the spread of the disease by removing mosquito breeding grounds , like old tires and containers that may hold standing water . But it can be difficult to tell whether these preventive measures work because dengue transmission depends on many factors , including the weather and how many people had developed immunity because of previous infections . A common way to study patterns of infection and immunity is to collect blood samples from a subset of the population before and after an outbreak . Unfortunately , large dengue outbreaks occur sporadically on islands , making it hard to set up a study like this ahead of an outbreak . During 2013 and 2014 , there was a major dengue outbreak in Fiji , with over 25 , 000 suspected cases reported . In response , the government introduced a nationwide mosquito clean-up campaign . As luck would have it , a group of researchers had collected blood samples immediately before the outbreak for an unrelated study of typhoid fever and leptospirosis . Now , Kucharski et al . – who include the researchers who collected those pre-outbreak blood samples – show that the clean-up campaign coincided with a reduction in transmission of the disease . Participants whose blood was collected before the dengue outbreak were invited to provide another blood sample after the dengue outbreak . This allowed Kucharski et al . to identify individuals who had already developed immunity to dengue before the outbreak and those who were likely infected during the outbreak . Comparing blood samples taken before and after the outbreak revealed that children and teenagers between the ages of 10 and 19 had the greatest risk of infection during the outbreak . No other demographic or environmental factors were strongly linked to the likelihood of infection . Computer models using the data also showed that the clean-up efforts could explain the reduced dengue transmission during the outbreak . These findings suggest that studying immunity against dengue can lead to a better understanding of disease transmission . This may help health agencies to gauge the effects of efforts to control this disease , and possibly forecast future outbreaks .", "article": "1 Introduction In recent years , the reported incidence of dengue has risen rapidly . In the Asia-Pacific region , which bears 75% of the global dengue disease burden , there are more than 1 . 8 billion people at risk of infection with dengue viruses ( DENV ) ( World Health Organization , 2009 ) . Increased air travel and urbanisation could have contributed to the geographic spread of infection ( Gubler , 1998; Simmons et al . , 2012 ) , with transmission by mosquitoes of the Aedes genus , including Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus ( Halstead , 2007 ) . DENV has four serotypes circulating , with infection conferring lifelong protection against the infecting serotype and short-lived protection against the others ( Sabin , 1952; Guzmán and Kourí , 2002 ) . Although four serotypes of DENV may co-circulate in South East Asia , only one serotype circulates in most of the South Pacific islands at any point in time ( Cao-Lormeau et al . , 2014; Li et al . , 2010 ) . Between November 2013 and July 2014 , a major outbreak caused by DENV-3 occurred in Fiji , with more than 25 , 000 suspected cases reported ( Figure 1A ) . Prior to the 2013/14 outbreak , there were eleven outbreaks of dengue recorded in Fiji , involving serotypes 1 , 2 and 4 ( Table 1 ) . Most cases in 2013/14 occurred on Viti Levu , the largest and most populous island . This is administratively divided into the Central Division , which includes the port-capital Suva , and Western Division , which contains the urban centres of Lautoka and Nadi , where Fiji’s major international airport is located . Dengue transmission in Central and Western Divisions is likely to be driven mostly by the Aedes aegypti vector , with Aedes albopictus most abundant in the Northern Division . Aedes polynesiensis and Aedes pseudoscutellaris are also present in all divisions ( Maguire et al . , 1971; Prakash et al . , 2001 ) . In response to the 2013/14 outbreak , considerable resources were dedicated to implementing control measures , including a nationwide vector clean-up campaign between 8th and 22nd March 2014 ( Break Dengue , 2014 ) . As well as media coverage and distribution of flyers to raise awareness about dengue prevention and protection , a major operation was put in place to remove rubbish that could act as egg laying habitats for mosquitoes . In total , forty-five tonnes of tyres and twenty-five tonnes of other containers were removed during this period . Large dengue outbreaks can place a substantial public health burden on island populations ( Fagbami et al . , 1995; Sharp et al . , 2014 ) . However , understanding the dynamics of infection and evaluating the impact of vector control measures remains challenging . There is a limited evidence base for control measures even in controlled trials ( Bowman et al . , 2016; Heintze et al . , 2007 ) , and post-outbreak evaluation is hindered by the fact that the size and duration of major outbreaks can be influenced by several factors , including population immunity , human movement , seasonal variation in transmission , and proportion of people living in urban , peri-urban and rural communities . In Fiji , dengue outbreaks typically occur during the wetter , warmer season between December and July , when vectors are most abundant ( Goettel et al . , 1980 ) . Although surveillance data can provide broad insights into arbovirus transmission patterns ( Cuong et al . , 2011; Funk et al . , 2016; van Panhuis et al . , 2015 ) , and cross-sectional serosurveys can be used to measure contemporary levels of immunity ( Aubry et al . , 2015; Ferguson et al . , 1999; Maguire et al . , 1974; Waterman et al . , 1993 ) , characterising infection dynamics in detail requires cohort-based seroepidemiological studies ( Cuong et al . , 2011; Reiner et al . , 2014 ) , which can be difficult to implement in island settings where outbreaks are infrequent and difficult to predict . Immediately before the 2013/14 dengue outbreak in Fiji , a population-representative serological survey had been conducted to study leptospirosis and typhoid ( Lau et al . , 2016 ) . To investigate patterns of dengue infection in 2013/14 , we followed up participants from this survey in Central Division , to obtain a set of paired pre- and post-outbreak serological samples ( see Materials and methods ) . We tested the paired samples for anti-DENV IgG antibodies using ELISA and a recombinant antigen-based microsphere immunoassay ( MIA ) , and combined these data with dengue surveillance data to compare possible explanations for the outbreak dynamics . We measured age-specific and spatial patterns of infection and reported disease , and tested whether there were demographic and environmental risk factors associated with infection . Having characterised factors shaping individual-level infection risk , we used a Bayesian approach to fit a transmission dynamic model to both the serological survey and surveillance data in order to estimate the contribution of climate and control measures to the decline in transmission observed in 2014 . 2 Results The pre- and post-outbreak serological survey included 263 participants from the Central Division , with age distribution of these participants consistent with the population distribution ( Figure 1B–C ) . We found that 58 . 6% of participants ( 154/263 ) were ELISA seropositive to at least one DENV serotype in late 2013 . Two years later , in October/November 2015 , this had risen to 74 . 5% ( 196/263 ) . Additional serotype-specific MIA tests confirmed that the largest rise in seroprevalence in Central Division was against DENV-3 , from 33 . 1% to 53 . 2% ( Table 2 ) , consistent with the majority of RT-PCR-confirmed samples during the outbreak being of this serotype . To characterise patterns of infection between 2013 and 2015 , we first considered individual-level demographic , behavioural and environmental factors . Using a univariable logistic regression model , we compared seroconversion determined by ELISA with questionnaire responses about household environment and health-seeking behaviour ( Table 3 ) . The factors most strongly associated with seroconversion between 2013–15 among initially seronegative participants were: living in an urban or peri-urban environment ( odds ratio 2 . 18 [95% CI: 0 . 953–5 . 11] , p=0 . 068 ) ; reporting fever in preceding two years ( odds 2 . 94 [1 . 08–8 . 38] , p=0 . 037 ) ; and visiting a doctor with fever in the preceding two years ( odds 3 . 15 [1 . 06–10 . 10] , p=0 . 043 ) . Of the participants who seroconverted , 10/38 ( 26 . 3% [13 . 4–43 . 1%] ) reported visiting a doctor with fever in the preceding two years , 2/38 ( 5 . 26% [0 . 644–17 . 7%] ) reported fever but did not visit a doctor , and 26/38 ( 68 . 4% [51 . 3–82 . 5%] ) did not report fever ( Supplementary file 1A ) . As well as estimating infection by measuring seroconversion based on threshold values , we also considered the distribution of ELISA values . There was a noticeable right shift in this distribution between 2013 and 2015 , with ELISA values increasing across a range of values ( Figure 2A ) . As some of the individual-level changes in value between the two tests were likely to be due to measurement error ( Salje et al . , 2014 ) , we fitted a mixture model to the distribution of changes in ELISA value ( Figure 2B ) . We used a normal distribution with mean zero to capture measurement error , and a gamma distribution to fit rise that could not be explained by this error function . The fitted model suggested that a rise in value of at least three was more likely to be a genuine increase rather than measurement error , as shown by the dashed line in Figure 2B . To explore the relationship between the initial ELISA value and rise post-outbreak , given that an individual had been infected , we fitted a generalized additive model to the data and weighted each observation by the probability that a specific participant had been infected based on the dashed line in Figure 2B . By adjusting to focus on likely infections , we found a negative relationship between initial value and subsequent rise , with ELISA values near zero rising by around 10 units , but higher values exhibiting a smaller rise ( Figure 2C ) . Using this approach , we also found strong evidence that self-reported symptoms were associated with larger rise in ELISA value , given likely infection . Using a logistic model with self-reported symptoms as outcome and change in value as dependent variable , adjusting for initial value and again weighting by probability of infection , we found that individuals who reported a fever in the preceding two years had a predicted rise in ELISA value that was 2 . 2 ( 95% 0 . 77–3 . 6 ) units higher than those who did not ( p=0 . 003 ) . Further , individuals who reported visiting a doctor with fever had a predicted value 3 . 3 ( 1 . 8–4 . 9 ) higher than others ( p=0 . 0005 ) . Examining age patterns of seroprevalence , we found an increase in the proportion seropositive against DENV with age in both 2013 and 2015 , and a rise in seroprevalence was observed in almost all age groups after the 2013/14 outbreak ( Figure 3A ) . However , the high levels of seroprevalence in older age groups made it challenging to estimate age-specific probability of infection , because there was a relative lack of serologically naive individuals in these groups to act as a denominator ( Table 4 ) . We therefore again used rise in ELISA value as a correlate of infection , based on Figure 2B . As well as producing more precise estimates of infection risk in older groups ( Table 4 ) , this approach also suggested that individuals aged 10–19 years were most likely to be infected . This is in contrast to the surveillance data , which indicated the highest per capita level of reported disease was in the 20–29 age group ( Figure 3B ) . Next , we explored spatial patterns of infection in different communities . Previous studies have suggested that dengue outbreaks can spread outwards from urban hubs to more rural areas ( Cummings et al . , 2004; Salje et al . , 2017 ) . A similar spatial pattern was observed from the surveillance data during the early stages of the 2013/14 Fiji outbreak ( Figure 4A ) . The first case was reported at Colonial War Memorial Hospital ( CWM ) , Fiji’s largest hospital located in central urban Suva , in the week ending 4th November 2013 . The outbreak took 9 weeks to reach the furthest reporting point from CWM in Central Division , a health centre 51 km away by Euclidean distance ( i . e . as the crow flies ) . We found limited association between Euclidean distance from CWM and proportion of study cluster seropositive to DENV-3 in 2015 ( Figure 4B ) : the Pearson correlation between ELISA seropositivity in each cluster and distance from CWM was ρ= –0 . 12 ( p=0 . 59 ) ; for DENV-3 the correlation coefficient was ρ= –0 . 46 ( p=0 . 03 ) . However , we found no significant association between the Euclidean distance from CWM and proportion of cluster infected ( Figure 4C ) . Pearson correlation between estimated proportion infected based on change ELISA value in each cluster and distance from CWM was ρ= 0 . 22 ( p=0 . 30 ) ; for DENV-3 the correlation was ρ= –0 . 36 ( p=0 . 09 ) . We did find evidence of dengue seroconversion in every cluster , however , suggesting that the outbreak eventually spread throughout Central Division . As we did not find strong evidence of individual or community-level heterogeneity in infection , we incorporated the surveillance data and paired serological survey data into mathematical models to test explanations for the observed outbreak dynamics at the division level . We considered three model variants: a simple age-structured model of vector-borne transmission dynamics; the same model structure , but with climate-driven variation in transmission; and a model with both climate-driven variation in transmission and a potential additional reduction in transmission coinciding with the clean-up campaign in March 2014 . When we jointly fitted the models to surveillance data and age-specific immunity , as measured by seropositivity to DENV-3 by MIA in 2013 and 2015 , the model with both climate-driven variation in transmission and an additional transmission reduction performed best as measured by AIC and DIC ( Figure 5A–B and Table 5 ) . This additional reduction in transmission was modelled using a flexible additional sigmoidal transmission rate , and was constrained so that the midpoint of the decline occurred after the start of the campaign on 8th March 2014 ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) ; we estimated a reduction of 57% ( 95% CrI: 42–82% ) in transmission that coincided with the clean-up campaign ( Figure 5C ) . As the effective reproduction number was near the critical value of one when the clean-up campaign was introduced ( Figure 5D–E ) , it suggests that the main contribution of control measures may have been to bring DENV-3 infections to sufficiently low levels for transmission to cease earlier . We obtained the same conclusions when ELISA rather than MIA seroprevalence was used to quantify immunity during model fitting ( Table 5 and Figure 5—figure supplement 2 ) . It was noticeable that the model fitted to the ELISA data produced a qualitatively better fit to the surveillance data than the model fitted to MIA data . This was because the observed MIA values imposed a stronger constraint on the plausible range of model estimated seroprevalence ( Figure 5B and Figure 5—figure supplement 2B ) , so in comparison the model fitted to ELISA data was able to attribute more of the slowdown in growth in the surveillance data during January/February to the accumulation of herd immunity . Fitting to the DENV-3 MIA seroprevalence data , we estimated that the mean basic reproduction number , R0 , over the course of the year was 1 . 12 ( 95% CrI: 1 . 02–1 . 25 ) , with a peak value of 1 . 87 ( 1 . 70–2 . 07 ) in January 2014 ( Table 6 ) . Posterior estimates are shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 3 and correlation plots for the transmission rate parameters are shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 4 . Accounting for stochastic variability in weekly case reporting , we estimated that 11% ( 1 . 1–39% ) of infections were reported as laboratory-tested cases and 9 . 3% ( 1 . 1–39% ) were reported as DLI cases . The estimated value of R0 was larger for the model fitted to ELISA data , with a mean of 1 . 49 ( 1 . 35–1 . 69 ) ; this was the result of a larger proportion of the population assumed to be initially immune to infection . As well as performing worse under AIC and DIC , the model with only climate-driven variation in transmission could not capture the overall shape of the surveillance data ( Figure 5—figure supplement 5 ) . The basic model , which had neither climate-driven variation in transmission nor an additional reduction in transmission , could not jointly reproduce both sets of data either ( Figure 5—figure supplement 6 ) . Fitting the basic model to the surveillance data alone , we could reproduce the observed incidence pattern under the assumption of a simple immunising epidemic . Specifically , the reported cases were consistent with an epidemic that declined as a result of depletion of the susceptible population ( Figure 5—figure supplement 7 ) . However , this basic epidemic model underestimated the initial level of immunity and overestimated final immunity . A similar discrepancy between serological surveys and surveillance data has been noted in previous arbovirus modelling studies , albeit for ZIKV rather than DENV ( Funk et al . , 2016; Kucharski et al . , 2016; Champagne et al . , 2016 ) . 3 Discussion We analysed surveillance reports and serological survey data to examine the dynamics of a major 2013/14 dengue outbreak in Fiji . Owing to the sporadic and unpredictable nature of dengue outbreaks in the Pacific ( Cao-Lormeau et al . , 2014 ) , it is rare to have access to paired population-representative sera collected before and after such an epidemic . Comparing surveillance and serological survey data made it possible to investigate the relationship between observed reported cases and the true attack rate and quantify the relative role of climate , herd immunity and control measures in shaping transmission . Analysis of detailed serological data provided insights into age-specific patterns of infection that would not be identified from seropositivity thresholds alone . We estimated the highest infection rate was in the 10–19-year-old age group , whereas proportionally the most reported cases were in the 20–29-year-old group . The apparent disparity between reported cases and infections estimated from the serological survey may be the result of secondary DENV infections causing more severe clinical disease and therefore increasing the likelihood of seeking medical care ( OhAinle et al . , 2011 ) . The ELISA results suggested that fewer than 50% of individuals under age 20 had experienced DENV infection in 2013 ( Figure 3A ) , which means an infection during the 2013/14 outbreak in this group was more likely to be primary than secondary . In contrast , the majority of 20–29 year olds already had evidence of infection in 2013 , and hence 2013/14 outbreak would have generated relatively more secondary or tertiary infections in this group . In addition , if age-specific infection rates are indeed higher in younger groups , it means that estimating population attack rates based on the proportion of seronegative individuals infected may over-estimate the true extent of infection . Focusing on the seronegative subset of the population leads to children being over-sampled , which in our data inflates attack rate estimates by around 10% compared to estimates based on change in ELISA value ( Table 4 ) . We also found little evidence of spatial heterogeneity in seroconversion . Although the locations of health centres reporting cases in the early stages of the outbreak suggested infection spread outwards from central Suva , we found evidence of DENV infection in all study clusters . This suggests that spatial structure may be more important in driving transmission dynamics early in the outbreak , but might not influence the final attack rate . One limitation of this comparison is that we did not have information on outbreak dynamics in the community: in the surveillance data , we only had the location of the health centres that cases reported to , rather than the location where infection likely occurred . Analysis of risk factors suggested that presence of self-reported symptoms between 2013–15 was associated with DENV infection . There was also a strong association between rise in ELISA value and self-reported symptoms in individuals who were likely infected , which suggests that raw values from serological tests could potentially be used to estimate the proportion of a population who were asymptomatic during a dengue outbreak , even in older age groups that were already seropositive . However , it is worth noting that the questionnaire that accompanied the serosurvey was brief and only asked about fever and visits to a doctor with fever; there may be specific factors that can better predict prior infection in such settings . We also conducted the follow up survey around 18 months after the outbreak , which means recall bias is a potential limitation of the risk factor analysis . We did not identify environmental factors that were significantly associated with infection , likely as a result of the relatively small sample size in the serological survey , but the estimated odds ratios were broadly consistent with factors that would be expected to increase or decrease infection risk ( Table 3 ) . To investigate potential explanations for the outbreak decline in early 2014 , we fitted a transmission dynamic model with two human age groups to both surveillance and serological survey data . Our analysis shows the benefits of combining multiple data sources: with surveillance data alone , it would not have been possible to distinguish between self-limiting outbreak driven by a decline in the susceptible population , and one that had ceased for another reason . With the addition of serological data in the model fitting , however , our model was able to quantify the relative contribution of herd immunity , climate and control measures to the outbreak dynamics . In particular , this model suggested that seasonal variation in transmission and herd immunity alone could not explain the fall in transmission . However , an additional decline in transmission in March 2014 , which coincided with a nationwide vector clean-up campaign , could better capture the observed patterns in serological and surveillance data . There are some limitations to our modelling analysis . First , we assumed that seropositivity in IgG antibody tests was equivalent to protective immunity . High levels of neutralising antibodies have been shown to correlate with protection from symptomatic infection ( Katzelnick et al . , 2016 ) , but it remains unclear precisely how much an individual with a given ELISA or MIA value contributes to transmission . Second , we focused on seroprevalence against DENV-3 in the main modelling analysis . As prior infection with one dengue serotype can lead to a cross-reactive immune response against other serotypes ( Guzmán and Kourí , 2002 ) , we fitted the model to ELISA results ( which were not serotype specific ) as a sensitivity analysis; this produced the same overall conclusions about which model performed best . Third , we used a flexible time-dependent transmission rate to capture a potential reduction in transmission as a result of control measures in March 2014 . The clean-up campaign included multiple concurrent interventions , which occurred alongside ongoing media coverage of the outbreak; it was therefore not possible to untangle how specific actions – such as vector habitat removal or changes in community behaviour that reduced chances of being bitten – contributed to the outbreak decline . Moreover , factors unrelated to control , such as spatial structure or local weather effects , may also have contributed to the observed decline in transmission; there was heavy rain and flooding in Viti Levu at the end of February 2014 ( ABC News , 2014 ) . Although we used a simple function to capture the potential impact of rainfall on vector density , it is unlikely that a more detailed mechanistic relationship would improve the model fit . The peak in rainfall in 2013/14 coincided with the peak in dengue cases; for rainfall to have strongly influenced observed transmission via a reduction in larval carrying capacity , it would need to have peaked earlier , to account for the time delays involved in the vector life cycle ( Lourenço et al . , 2017 ) . We also assumed that all of the population could potentially be infected in the model . Some of the discrepancy between the high attack rate predicted by a randomly mixing model and lower observed seroconversion could in theory be explained by heterogeneity in transmission ( Funk et al . , 2016 ) , which would be expected to reduce the overall proportion infected during an outbreak . If such heterogeneity exists , it is unlikely to act in an ‘all-or-nothing’ manner over time , with the same individuals remaining at low risk: the high level of seroprevalence in older age groups suggests that only a small proportion of individuals have consistently avoided infection ( Figure 3 ) . Finally , our analysis focused on Central Division , Fiji . However , much of the data used in our model – such as surveillance data , post-outbreak serology , and climate information – would be available for other settings . For factors that are harder to measure without paired serology , like age-specific infection rates and potential effectiveness of control measures , a joint inference approach could be employed that combines prior distributions based on the data presented here with available outbreak data from the other location of interest ( Funk et al . , 2016 ) . Despite these caveats , our results show that transmission dynamic models developed using a combination of serological surveys and surveillance data can be valuable tool for examining dengue fever outbreaks . As well as providing insights into the transmission and control of dengue , the analysis has implications for forecasting of future epidemics . During February and March 2014 , members of the research team based at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine provided real-time analysis and outbreak projections for the Fiji National Centre for Communicable Disease Control , to support public health planning ( Nand et al . , 2016 ) . However , a lack of serological data at the time meant it was necessary to make strong assumptions about pre-existing population immunity . With up-to-date population representative serology now available , forecasting models during future outbreaks will be able to include a more realistic herd immunity profile from the outset . Such seroepidemiological approaches could also be employed in other settings , to provide improved forecasts of dengue transmission dynamics and potential disease burden prior to and during outbreaks , as well as quantitative retrospective evaluation of the effectiveness of control measures . 4 Materials and methods In December 2013 , the dengue outbreak in Fiji was determined to be due to DENV-3 by RT-PCR performed on serum samples sent to the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Arbovirus Reference and Research at the Queensland University of Technology ( QUT , Brisbane ) . Hereafter , samples that were ELISA reactive for NS1 antigen or IgM were presumed to be to DENV-3 infections with a sub-sample of them sent for confirmatory serotyping at QUT , the Institut Louis Malardé ( ILM ) and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . Of the 10 , 442 laboratory tested cases that were notified to the Fiji National Centre for Communicable Disease Control between 27th October 2013 and 4th March 2014 , 4115 ( 39 . 4% ) were reactive for DENV NS1 and/or anti-DENV IgM . After this time period , dengue surveillance was transitioned from laboratory to clinical-based reporting ( i . e . dengue-like illness , DLI ) due to the size of the outbreak ( Figure 6 ) . Between 27th October 2013 and 31st August 2014 , 25 , 494 suspected cases of dengue ( i . e . laboratory tested or confirmed or DLI ) were notified to the Fijian Ministry of Health . Of these , 12 , 413 ( 48 . 7% ) cases were in Central Division , predominantly in the greater Suva area ( Figure 1 ) . 10 , 679 cases were reported in the Western Division , 2048 cases were reported in the Northern division , largely in or near Labasa , the largest town of Vanua Levu island , and 354 cases were reported in the Eastern Division . For the lab-confirmed cases , date of testing was used to compile weekly case incidence time series; for the DLI data , date of presentation to a health centre was used , as these dates were most complete . Filter paper-based surveillance conducted by ILM between December 2013 and October 2014 found 24 samples positive for DENV-3 by RT-PCR , as well as three samples positive for DENV-2 and one for DENV-1 . During 2014/15 , there was a flare up of DENV-2 in Fiji . However , relatively few cases occurred on Viti Levu: of the 543 confirmed cases nationally between 1st January 2015 and 29th April 2015 , 437 cases ( 80% ) were from the Northern Division ( World Health Organisation , 2015 ) . We conducted a serological survey using pre- and post-outbreak sera from 23 communities in Central Division . Pre-outbreak sera were collected as part of population representative community-based surveys of leptospirosis and typhoid conducted in Central Division between September and November 2013 ( Lau et al . , 2016; Watson et al . , 2017 ) . Population-proportionate sampling was used to select local nursing zones ( the smallest administrative unit ) . From each of these zones , one community was randomly selected , followed by 25 households from each community and one individual from each of the households . Coincidentally , the sample collection in Central Division finished the same week as the first dengue cases were reported ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1 ) . Post-outbreak sera were collected during a follow-up study carried out in October and November 2015 . Field teams visited participants in Central Division who had previously participated in the 2013 serological study and had consented to being contacted again for health research . Participants who gave informed consent for the 2015 study completed a questionnaire and provided a 5 ml blood sample . The study was powered to measure the rise in prevalence of anti-DENV antibodies between 2013–15 . Historical dengue outbreaks in Fiji ( Table 1 ) suggested we would expect to see seroconversion in at least 20% of the study population . Allowing for 5% seroreversion , and 0 . 05 probability of type-1 error , McNemar’s test suggested 250 paired samples could detect a 15% increase in seroprevalence with 95% power , and a 20% increase with ≈100% power . We also collected data on potential risk factors and healthcare-seeking behaviour during this period . The questionnaire asked for details of fever and related visits to a doctor in the preceding two years , and the same for household members in the preceding two years . The questionnaire also recorded details of household environment , including potential mosquito breeding grounds ( Supplementary file 2 ) . The 2013 typhoid and leptospirosis studies and the 2015 follow up study were approved by the Fiji National Research Ethics Review Committee ( ref 2013–03 and 2015 . 111 . C . D ) and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Observational Research Ethics Committee ( ref 6344 and 10207 ) . Participants in the 2015 follow up study were people who had previously given informed consent to have their blood tested as part of a public health serum bank established in the 2013 typhoid and leptospirosis serosurvey , and agreed to be contacted again by public health researchers . The study was explained in English or the local iTaukei language by bilingual field officers , at the potential participants’ preference . Adults gave written informed consent , or thumbprinted informed consent witnessed by a literate adult independent from the study . For children age 12–17 years , written consent was obtained from both the parent and the child . For children aged under 12 years , written consent was obtained from the parent only , though information was provided to both . Paired pre- and post-outbreak serum samples were tested using an indirect IgG ELISA kit ( PanBio Cat No 01PE30 ) , according to manufacturer guidelines . This assay employs recombinant DENV envelope proteins of all four serotypes ( McBride et al . , 1998 ) . Samples with ELISA value of ≤9 PanBio units were defined as seronegative , ≥11 PanBio units seropositive , and values between 9 and 11 as equivocal . Seroconversion was defined as a change from seronegative to seropositive status . Because the indirect IgG ELISA does not distinguish between DENV serotypes , samples were also tested against each of the four specific DENV serotypes using a recombinant antigen-based microsphere immunoassay ( MIA ) , as previously used to examine seroprevalence against different flaviviruses in French Polynesia ( Aubry et al . , 2017 , 2018 ) . Specifically , we wanted to measure the change in seropositivity to DENV-3 during the study period . As an additional validation , a subset of fifty samples from Central Division – including a mixture of those seronegative and seropositive by ELISA and MIA – were tested for the presence of neutralising antibodies against each of the four DENV serotypes using a neutralisation assay as previously described ( Cao-Lormeau et al . , 2016 ) . A neutralisation titre of ≥20 was defined as seropositive ( Figure 6—figure supplement 2A ) . For both MIA and neutralisation assay results , the largest change in seropositivity was for DENV-3 ( Supplementary file 1B ) . When seropositivity to any DENV ( i . e . seropositive to at least one serotype ) was compared , a similar change was observed across ELISA , MIA and neutralisation assay results between 2013 and 2015 . Based on ELISA seropositivity in 2015 alone , it would not be possible to identify infections during the 2013/14 outbreak among individuals who were initially seropositive in 2013 . We therefore examined the changes in paired individual-level ELISA values between 2013 and 2015 . To estimate the probability that a given increase in ELISA value was the result of a genuine rise rather than measurement error , we fitted a two distribution mixture model to the distribution of changes in value between 2013 and 2015 . We used a normal distribution with mean equal to zero to reflect measurement error , and a gamma distribution to capture a rise that could not be explained by the symmetric error function . The observed changes in ELISA value we fitted to ranged from −6 to 20; we omitted two outliers that had a change in value of −9 between 2013 and 2015 , as these could not be explained with a normally distributed measurement error function . It was not possible to perform the same analysis using the MIA data because unlike the ELISA and neutralisation assay data , the raw MIA values did not follow a bimodal distribution that indicated likely naive and previously exposed individuals ( Figure 6—figure supplement 2B ) . We used a generalized additive model with binomial link function to examine the relationship between ELISA value in 2013 and rise between 2013 and 2015 , with data points weighted by probability that the change in ELISA value was the result of a genuine rise rather than measurement error . Risk factor analysis was performed using a univariable logistic regression model . Both were implemented using the mgcv package in R version 3 . 3 . 1 ( Wood , 2006; R Core Team , 2015 ) . We assumed that the vector-specific parameters varied over time in the model , as a result of seasonal changes in temperature and rainfall ( Descloux et al . , 2012 ) . During 2013/14 in Central Division , average monthly rainfall ranged from around 100 to 400 mm , and daily temperature varied between 21 and 30∘C ( The World Bank , 2016; Fiji Meteorological Service , 2017 ) . Temperature reached its maximum in January/February , and minimum in August/September ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1A ) . As the daily temperature data were noisy and surveillance data were only available on a weekly timescale , in the model we defined tempt as the seven day moving average of temperature on day t ( i . e . the average temperature over the preceding week ) . We also defined raint as the average rainfall on day t , interpolated from monthly data ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1B ) . Based on estimated mechanistic relationships between temperature and Aedes aegypti dynamics ( Lourenço et al . , 2017; Mordecai et al . , 2017 ) , we assumed that the following vector-specific parameters were temperature dependent: extrinsic incubation period , 1/νv⁢ ( t ) ; lifespan , 1/δ⁢ ( t ) ; biting rate , α⁢ ( t ) ; probability of transmission to a human , pv⁢h⁢ ( t ) ; and probability of infection from an infectious human , ph⁢v⁢ ( t ) . We incorporated these temperature-dependent dynamics using symmetric ( ϕ ) and asymmetric ( ψ ) unimodal thermal response functions ( Mordecai et al . , 2017; Briere et al . , 1999 ) : ( 13 ) ϕ⁢ ( x , y , Tm , T0 ) ={min⁡{y⁢ ( x-T0 ) ⁢ ( Tm-x ) , 1}if ⁢T0<x<Tm0else ( 14 ) ψ⁢ ( x , y , Tm , T0 ) ={min⁡{y⁢x⁢ ( x-T0 ) ⁢Tm-x , 1}if ⁢T0<x<Tm0else The parameters were defined using the median estimated value from these functions fitted to empirical data ( Mordecai et al . , 2017 ) : ( 15 ) 1/νv ( t ) =1/ ( νv^ϕ ( tempt , 6 . 11×10−5 , 45 . 53 , 10 . 30 ) /0 . 10 ) ( 16 ) 1/δ ( t ) =1/ ( δ^ψ ( tempt , 9 . 02 , 37 . 66 , −0 . 14 ) /29 . 00 ) ( 17 ) α ( t ) =α^ϕ ( tempt , 0 . 00020 , 40 . 04 , 13 . 76 ) /0 . 22 ( 18 ) pvh ( t ) =ϕ ( tempt , 0 . 00083 , 35 . 78 , 17 . 23 ) ( 19 ) phv ( t ) =ϕ ( tempt , 0 . 00049 , 37 . 38 , 12 . 67 ) Here 1/νv⁢ ( t ) , 1/δ⁢ ( t ) and α⁢ ( t ) are normalised so that they equal 1/νv^ , 1/δ^ , and α^ respectively when tempt=25∘C . In the model , most of these parameters varied monotonically within the temperature range observed in Fiji ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1C–G ) . We used informative priors for the average extrinsic latent period , 1/νv^ , mosquito lifespan , 1/δv^ , and biting rate , α^ ( Table 7 ) . We assumed that vector density , m⁢ ( t ) , could vary with both temperature and rainfall ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1H–I ) . The contribution of vector density to transmission was influenced by four factors ( Mordecai et al . , 2017 ) : fecundity , f ( i . e . number of eggs produced per female mosquito per day ) ; egg-to-adult survival probability , e , the mosquito development rate , d , and the larval carrying capacity K . In the model , vector density over time was equal to: ( 20 ) m ( t ) =m ( tempt , raint ) ( 21 ) =m^m0e ( t ) f ( t ) d ( t ) K ( t ) 1+K ( t ) where m^m0 is a scaling term and the K/ ( 1+K ) term incorporating carrying capacity follows from the equilibrium solution of the logistic growth model ( Pearl and Reed , 1920 ) ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1I ) . We assumed that d , e , and f were temperature dependent , based on functions fitted to empirical data ( Mordecai et al . , 2017 ) , and K was linearly dependent on rainfall: ( 22 ) d ( t ) =ϕ ( tempt , 7 . 84e×10−5 , 39 . 10 , 11 . 56 ) ( 23 ) e ( t ) =ψ ( tempt , 13 . 58 , 38 . 29 , −0 . 0060 ) ( 24 ) f ( t ) =ϕ ( tempt , 0 . 0082 , 34 . 44 , 14 . 78 ) ( 25 ) K ( t ) =K^raint/222 . 44 K⁢ ( t ) was normalised so its mean value over the year was equal to K^ and we set m0=0 . 5752381 so that m⁢ ( t ) =m^⁢K/ ( 1+K ) when the temperature was 25∘ . Prior distributions for parameter values are given in Table 7 . In the absence of control measures , the vector-to-human , βh , and human-to-vector , βv , transmission rates were therefore: ( 26 ) βv ( t ) =α ( t ) pvh ( t ) ( 27 ) βh ( t ) =α ( t ) phv ( t ) m ( t ) To capture the potential additional reduction in transmission over time as a result of the national clean-up campaign between 8th and 22nd March 2014 , we used a flexible sigmoid function: ( 28 ) χ ( t ) = ( 1−a21+e−a1 ( t−aτ ) ) We constrained this function so that the midpoint , aτ , was between the start date of the campaign , 8th March 2014 , and 5th April 2014 , four weeks later ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1J ) . We assumed that this function acted to reduce the vector-to-human transmission rate: ( 29 ) βh ( t ) =α ( t ) m ( t ) χ ( t ) There were multiple concurrent interventions during the clean-up campaign , including promotion of awareness about protection from bites as well as larval habitat removal . Given the structure of the data available , it would not be possible to independently estimate the extent to which the campaign directly reduced vector-to-human transmission , that is χ⁢ ( t ) acting on α⁢ ( t ) , rather than vector density , that is χ⁢ ( t ) acting on m⁢ ( t ) . However , if there had been a substantial effect on larval habitat capacity but not on biting rate , we may expect to infer a larger value of aτ , to reflect the delay in impact as a result of the time required for vector development . The next generation matrix for humans and vectors was defined as follows ( Manore et al . , 2014 , 2017 ) : ( Rh⁢hRh⁢vRv⁢hRv⁢v ) = ( 0βh⁢ ( Sh⁢c+Sh⁢a ) ⁢νvδ⁢ ( δ+νv ) ⁢Nβv⁢Svγ0 ) and the effective reproduction number , R , was equal to the dominant eigenvalue of this matrix . The basic reproduction , R0 , was calculated by the same method , but assuming that both humans and vectors were fully susceptible . The model was jointly fitted to laboratory-confirmed case data and serological data using Markov chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC ) via a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm . For the case data , we considered time units of one week . To construct a likelihood for the observed cases , we defined case count for week t as ct=Ct-Ct-1 . Because reporting switched from lab tested to DLI during the outbreak , we jointly fitted two sets of time series data . The first dataset was lab tested cases . We defined the first observation as 4th November 2013 , the week of the first confirmed case in Central Division , and the last observation as 26th May . The second dataset was DLI cases , which we fitted from 1st February until 26th May . Earlier DLI cases were not included as these were likely to reflect reporting artefacts rather than genuine infections . The two time series we fitted were disjoint: cases were either reported as lab tested or DLI . We assumed that the two set of observed cases followed a negative binomial distributions with mean qt⁢rl⁢a⁢b⁢ct and ( 1-qt ) ⁢rD⁢L⁢I⁢ct respectively , and a shared dispersion parameter ρ , to account for potential temporal variability in reporting ( Bretó et al . , 2009 ) . We used a negative binomial distribution to allow for both under- or over-reporting , the latter being potentially relevant in the final stages of the outbreak when case numbers were low . Here qt denotes the proportion of cases in week t that are lab tested rather than reported as DLI . As it was not possible to fit this value for each week , it was fixed in the model as qt=yl⁢a⁢b/ ( yl⁢a⁢b⁢ ( t ) +yD⁢L⁢I⁢ ( t ) ) , where yl⁢a⁢b⁢ ( t ) and yD⁢L⁢I⁢ ( t ) are the number of observed lab tested and DLI cases in week t respectively . The total expected number of reported cases in week t was therefore equal to ( qt⁢rl⁢a⁢b+ ( 1-qt ) ⁢rD⁢L⁢I ) ⁢ct . As well as fitting to surveillance data , we fitted the model to the proportion of each age group immune ( as measured by seroprevalence ) at the start and end of the outbreak . Let Xi⁢j be a binomially distributed random variable with size equal to the sample size in group i and probability equal to the model predicted immunity in year j , and zi⁢j be the observed seroprevalence in group i in year j . The overall log-likelihood for parameter set θ given case data Y={yt}t=1T and serological data Z={zi⁢j}i∈{1 , 2} , j∈{2013 , 2015} was therefore: ( 30 ) L ( θ|Y , Z ) =∑tlogP ( yt|ct ) +∑i=12∑j∈{2013 , 2015}logP ( Xi⁢j=zi⁢j ) We considered four model scenarios: an SEIR model without climate-driven variation or control , fitted to surveillance data only; SEIR model without climate-driven variation or control , fitted to surveillance and serological data; SEIR model with climate-driven variation only , fitted to surveillance and serological data; SEIR model with climate-driven variation and control , fitted to surveillance and serological data . We fitted the model to either MIA or ELISA data , to reflect two different assumptions about the relationship between seroprevalence and immunity . The model using MIA data made the assumption that only individuals who were seropositive to DENV-3 were immune to this serotype . As a sensitivity analysis , the model using ELISA data assumed that seropositivity to any DENV serotype indicated immunity to DENV-3 . All observations were given equal weight in the model fitting . The joint posterior distribution of the parameter set θ was obtained from 200 , 000 MCMC iterations , each with a burn-in period of 20 , 000 iterations . We used adaptive MCMC to improve efficiency of mixing: we iteratively adjusted the magnitude of the covariance matrix used to resample θ to obtain a target acceptance rate of 0 . 234 ( Roberts and Rosenthal , 2009 ) . Posterior estimates for MIA and ELISA data are shown in Supplementary files 1C–D . The statistical and mathematical models were implemented in R version 3 . 3 . 1 ( R Core Team , 2015 ) using the deSolve package ( Soetaert et al . , 2010 ) and parallelised using the doMC library ( Revolution Analytics , 2014 ) . We compared the performance of different models using the deviance information criterion ( DIC ) , which accounts for the trade off between model fit and complexity ( Spiegelhalter et al . , 2002 ) . The deviance of a model for a given parameter set , θ , is given by D ( θ ) =−2L ( θ|Y , Z ) . The DIC is therefore: ( 31 ) D⁢I⁢C=D⁢ ( θ¯ ) +var⁢ ( D⁢ ( θ ) ) where θ¯ is the median of θ with respect to the posterior distribution and var⁢ ( D⁢ ( θ ) ) /2 is the effective number of parameters . The median of θ as used rather than mean because the likelihood was non-log-concave in θ , which meant that the posterior mean was a poor estimator ( Spiegelhalter et al . , 2002 ) . As an additional validation , we compared models using the Akaike information criterion ( AIC ) , which accounts for the trade off between model fit and complexity ( Akaike , 1973 ) . The AIC of a model for a given parameter set , θ , is given by A⁢I⁢C=-2⁢L^⁢ ( θ ) +2⁢np⁢a⁢r⁢a⁢m where L^⁢ ( θ ) is the maximised value of the likelihood and np⁢a⁢r⁢a⁢m is the number of parameters .

Computational models that attempt to describe the relationships between the brain and specific behaviours quantitatively is becoming increasingly popular in this field . This approach may help determine the causes of certain behaviours and make predictions about what behaviours will be triggered by specific changes in the brain . Many of the computational models used in cognitive neuroscience are built based on experimental data . A good model can predict the results of new experiments given a specific set of conditions with few parameters . Candidate models are often called ‘generative’: models that can simulate data . However , typically , cognitive neuroscience studies require going the other way around: they need to infer models and their parameters from experimental data . Ideally , it should also be possible to properly assess the remaining uncertainty over the parameters after having access to the experimental data . To facilitate this , the Bayesian approach to statistical analysis has become popular in cognitive neuroscience . Common software tools for Bayesian estimation require a ‘likelihood function’ , which measures how well a model fits experimental data for given values of the unknown parameters . A major obstacle is that for all but the most common models , obtaining precise likelihood functions is computationally costly . In practice , this requirement limits researchers to evaluating and comparing a small subset of neurocognitive models for which a likelihood function is known . As a result , it is convenience , rather than theoretical interest , that guides this process . In order to provide one solution for this problem , Fengler et al . developed a method that allows users to perform Bayesian inference on a larger number of models without high simulation costs . This method uses likelihood approximation networks ( LANs ) , a computational tool that can estimate likelihood functions for a broad class of models of decision making , allowing researchers to estimate parameters and to measure how well models fit the data . Additionally , Fengler et al . provide both the code needed to build networks using their approach and a tutorial for users . The new method , along with the user-friendly tool , may help to discover more realistic brain dynamics underlying cognition and behaviour as well as alterations in brain function .", "article": "1 Introduction ABC methods apply when one has access to a parametric stochastic simulator ( also referred to as generative model ) , but , unlike the usual setting for statistical inference , no access to an explicit mathematical formula for the likelihood of observations given the simulator’s parameter setting . While likelihood functions for a stochastic stimulator can in principle be mathematically derived , this can be exceedingly challenging even for some historically famous models such as the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck ( OU ) process ( Lipton and Kaushansky , 2018 ) and may be intractable in many others . Consequently , the statistical community has increasingly developed ABC tools that enable posterior inference of such ‘likelihood-free’ stochastic models while completely bypassing any likelihood derivations ( Cranmer et al . , 2020 ) . Given a parametric stochastic simulator model ℳ and dataset 𝐱 , instead of exact inference based on pℳ⁢ ( θ|𝐱 ) , these methods attempt to draw samples from an approximate posterior p~ℳ⁢ ( θ|𝐱 ) . Consider the following general equation:p~ℳ⁢ ( θ|𝐱 ) ∝∫Kh⁢ ( ||sℳ-s𝐱|| ) ⁢pℳ⁢ ( sℳ|θ ) ⁢𝑑sℳ⁢π⁢ ( θ ) ∝p~ℳ⁢ ( 𝐱|θ ) ⁢π⁢ ( θ ) where sℳ refers to sufficient statistics ( roughly , summary statistics of a dataset that retain sufficient information about the parameters of the generative process ) . Kh ( ||sℳ−sx|| ) refers to a kernel-based distance measure/cost function , which evaluates a probability density function for a given distance between the observed and expected summary statistics ||sℳ-s𝐱|| . The parameter h ( commonly known as bandwidth parameter ) modulates the cost gradient . Higher values of h lead to more graceful decreases in cost ( and therefore a worse approximation of the true posterior ) . By generating simulations , one can use such summary statistics to obtain approximate likelihood functions , denoted as p~ℳ⁢ ( 𝐱|θ ) , where approximation error can be mitigated by generating large numbers of simulations . The caveat is that the amount of simulation runs needed to achieve a desired degree of accuracy in the posterior can render such techniques computationally infeasible . With a focus on amortization , our goal is to leverage some of the insights and developments in the ABC community to develop NN architectures that can learn approximate likelihoods deployable for any inference scenario ( and indeed any inference method , including MCMC , variational inference , or even MLE ) without necessitating repeated training . We next describe our particular approach and return to a more detailed comparison to existing methods in the 'Discussion' section . In this section , we outline our approach to amortization of computational costs of large numbers of simulations required by traditional ABC methods . Amortization approaches incur a one-off ( potentially quite large ) simulation cost to enable cheap , repeated inference for any dataset . Recent research has led to substantial developments in this area ( Cranmer et al . , 2020 ) . The most straightforward approach is to simply simulate large amounts of data and compile a database of how model parameters are related to observed summary statistics of the data ( Mestdagh et al . , 2019 ) . This database can then be used during parameter estimation in empirical datasets using a combination of nearest-neighbor search and local interpolation methods . However , this approach suffers from the curse of dimensionality with respect to storage demands ( a problem that is magnified with increasing model parameters ) . Moreover , its reliance on summary statistics ( Sisson et al . , 2018 ) does not naturally facilitate flexible reuse across inference scenarios ( e . g . , hierarchical models , multiple conditions while fixing some parameters across conditions , etc . ) . To fulfill all desiderata outlined in the introduction , we focus on directly encapsulating the likelihood function over empirical observations of a simulation model so that likelihood evaluation is substantially cheaper than constructing ( empirical ) likelihoods via model simulation online during inference . Such empirical observations could be , for example , trial-wise choices and reaction times ( RTs ) . This strategy then allows for flexible reuse of such approximate likelihood functions ℓ^⁢ ( θ|𝐱 ) in a large variety of inference scenarios applicable to common experimental design paradigms . Specifically , we encapsulate ℓ^⁢ ( θ|𝐱 ) as a feed-forward NN , which allows for parallel evaluation by design . We refer to these networks as likelihood approximation networks ( LANs ) . Figure 1 spells out the setting ( A ) and usage ( B ) of such a method . The LAN architectures used in this paper are simple , small in size , and are made available for download for local usage . While this approach does not allow for instantaneous posterior inference , it does considerably reduce computation time ( by up to three orders of magnitude; see ‘Run time’ section ) when compared to approaches that demand simulations at inference . Notably , this approach also substantially speeds up inference even for models that are not entirely likelihood free but nevertheless require costly numerical methods to obtain likelihoods . Examples are the full-DDM with inter-trial variability in parameters ( for which likelihoods can be obtained via numerical integration , as is commonly done in software packages such as HDDM but with substantial cost ) , but also other numerical methods for generalized DDMs ( Shinn et al . , 2020; Drugowitsch , 2016 ) . At the same time , we maintain the high degree of flexibility with regards to deployment across arbitrary inference scenarios . As such , LANs can be treated as a highly flexible plug-in to existing inference algorithms and remain conceptually simple and lightweight . Before elaborating our LAN approach , we briefly situate it in the context of some related work . One branch of literature that interfaces ABC with deep learning attempts to amortize posterior inference directly in end-to-end NNs ( Radev et al . , 2020b; Radev et al . , 2020a; Papamakarios and Murray , 2016; Papamakarios et al . , 2019a; Gonçalves et al . , 2020 ) . Here , NN architectures are trained with a large number of simulated datasets to produce posterior distributions over parameters , and once trained , such networks can be applied to directly estimate parameters from new datasets without the need for further simulations . However , the goal to directly estimate posterior parameters from data requires the user to first train a NN for the very specific inference scenario in which it is applied empirically . Such approaches are not easily deployable if a user wants to test multiple inference scenarios ( e . g . , parameters may vary as a function of task condition or brain activity , or in hierarchical frameworks ) , and consequently , they do not achieve our second desideratum needed for a user-friendly toolbox , making inference cheap and simple . We return to discuss the relative merits and limitations of these and further alternative approaches in the 'Discussion' section . Formally , we use model simulations to learn a function fΦ⁢ ( x , θ ) , where fΦ ( . ) is the output of a NN with parameter vector Φ ( weights , biases ) . The function fΦ⁢ ( 𝐱 , θ ) is used as an approximation ℓ^⁢ ( θ|𝐱 ) of the likelihood function ℓ⁢ ( θ|𝐱 ) . Once learned , we can use such f as a plug-in to Bayes' rule:p^ ( θ|x ) ∝∏i=1Nℓ^ ( θ|xi ) p ( θ ) To perform posterior inference , we can now use a broad range of existing MC or MCMC algorithms . We note that , fulfilling our second desideratum , an extension to hierarchical inference is as simple as plugging in our NN into a probabilistic model of the formp^⁢ ( θ|𝐱 ) ∝∏j=1J∏i=1Nℓ^⁢ ( θj|xj⁢i ) ⁢p⁢ ( θj|α , β ) ⁢p⁢ ( α , β|γ ) where α , β are generic group-level global parameters , and γ serves as a generic fixed hyperparameter vector . We provide proofs of concepts for two types of LANs . While we use MLPs and convolutional neural networks ( CNNs ) , of conceptual importance is the distinction between the two problem representations they tackle , rather than the network architectures per se . The first problem representation , which we call the pointwise approach , considers the functions fΦ⁢ ( x|θ ) , where θ is the parameter vector of a given stochastic simulator model , and x is a single datapoint ( trial outcome ) . The pointwise approach is a mapping from the input dimension |Θ|+|x| , where | . | refers to the cardinality , to the one-dimensional output . The output is simply the log-likelihood of the single datapoint x given the parameter vector θ . As explained in the next section , for this mapping we chose simple MLPs . The second problem representation , which we will refer to as the histogram approach , instead aims to learn a function fΦ ( . |θ ) , which maps a parameter vector θ to the likelihood over the full ( discretized ) dataspace ( i . e . , the likelihood of the entire RT distributions at once ) . We represent the output space as an outcome histogram with dimensions n×m ( where in our applications n is the number of bins for a discretization of reaction times , and m refers to the number of distinct choices ) . Thus , our mapping has input dimension |Θ| and output dimension |m×n| . Representing the problem this way , we chose CNNs as the network architecture . In each of the above cases , we pursued the architectures that seemed to follow naturally , without any commitment to their optimality . The pointwise approach operates on low-dimensional inputs and outputs . With network evaluation speed being of primary importance to us , we chose a relatively shallow MLP to learn this mapping , given that it was expressive enough . However , when learning a mapping from a parameter vector θ to the likelihood over the full dataspace , as in the histogram approach , we map a low-dimensional data manifold to a much higher dimensional one . Using an MLP for this purpose would imply that the number of NN parameters needed to learn this function would be orders of magnitude larger than using a CNN . Not only would this mean that forward passes through the network would take longer , but also an increased propensity to overfit on an identical data budget . The next two sections will give some detail regarding the networks chosen for the pointwise and histogram LANs . Figure 1 illustrates the general idea of our approach while Figure 2 gives a conceptual overview of the exact training and inference procedure proposed . These details are thoroughly discussed in the last section of the paper . As a first approach , we use simple MLPs to learn the likelihood function of a given stochastic simulator . The network learns the mapping {θ , 𝐱}→log⁡ℓΦ⁢ ( θ|𝐱 ) , where θ represents the parameters of our stochastic simulator , 𝐱 are the simulator outcomes ( in our specific examples below , 𝐱 , refers to the tuple ( r⁢t , c ) of reaction times and choices ) , and log⁡ℓ⁢ ( θ|𝐱 ) is the log-likelihood of the respective outcome . The trained network then serves as the approximate likelihood function log⁡ℓ^Φ⁢ ( θ|𝐱 ) . We emphasize that the network is trained as a function approximator to provide us with a computationally cheap likelihood estimate , not to provide a surrogate simulator . Biological plausibility of the network is therefore not a concern when it comes to architecture selection . Fundamentally this approach attempts to learn the log-likelihood via a nonlinear regression , for which we chose an MLP . Log-likelihood labels for training were derived from empirical likelihoods functions ( details are given in the 'Materials and methods' section ) , which in turn were constructed as kernel density estimates ( KDEs ) . The construction of KDEs roughly followed Turner et al . , 2015 . We chose the Huber loss function ( details are given in the 'Materials and methods' section ) because it is more robust to outliers and thus less susceptible to distortions that can arise in the tails of distributions . Our second approach is based on a CNN architecture . Whereas the MLP learned to output a single scalar likelihood output for each datapoint ( ‘trial’ , given a choice , reaction time , and parameter vector ) , the goal of the CNN was to evaluate , for the given model parameters , the likelihood of an arbitrary number of datapoints via one forward pass through the network . To do so , the output of the CNN was trained to produce a probability distribution over a discretized version of the dataspace , given a stochastic model and parameter vector . The network learns the mapping θ→logℓΦ ( θ| . ) . As a side benefit , in line with the methods proposed by Lueckmann et al . , 2019; Papamakarios et al . , 2019b , the CNN can in fact act as a surrogate simulator; for the purpose of this paper , we do not exploit this possibility however . Since here we attempt to learn distributions , labels were simple binned empirical likelihoods , and as a loss function we chose the Kullback Leibler ( KL ) divergence between the network's output distribution and the label distribution ( details are given in the 'Materials and methods' section ) . Most of the specifics regarding training procedures are discussed in detail in the 'Materials and methods' section; however , we mention some aspects here to aid readability . We used 1 . 5 M and 3 M parameter vectors ( based on 100k simulations each ) to train the MLP and CNN approach , respectively . We chose these numbers consistently across all models and in fact trained on less examples for the MLP only due to RAM limitations we faced on our machines ( which in principle can be circumvented ) . These numbers are purposely high ( but in fact quite achievable with access to a computing cluster , simulations for each model was on the order of hours only ) since we were interested in a workable proof of concept . We did not investigate the systematic minimization of training data; however , some crude experiments indicate that a decrease by an order of magnitude did not seriously affect performance . We emphasize that this is in line with the expressed philosophy of our approach . The point of amortization is to throw a lot of resources at the problem once so that downstream inference is made accessible even on basic setups ( a usual laptop ) . In case simulators are prohibitively expensive even for reasonably sized computer clusters , minimizing training data may gain more relevance . In such scenarios , training the networks will be very cheap compared to simulation time , which implies that retraining with progressively more simulations until one observes asymptotic test performance is a viable strategy . We chose variations of SSMs common in the cognitive neurosciences as our test bed ( Figure 3 ) . The range of models we consider permits great flexibility in allowable data distributions ( choices and response times ) . We believe that initial applications are most promising for such SSMs because ( 1 ) analytical likelihoods are available for the most common variants ( and thus provide an upper-bound benchmark for parameter recovery ) and ( 2 ) there exist many other interesting variants for which no analytic solution exists . We note that there is an intermediate case in which numerical methods can be applied to obtain likelihoods for a broader class of models ( e . g . , Shinn et al . , 2020 ) . These methods are nevertheless computationally expensive and do not necessarily afford rapid posterior inference . Therefore , amortization via LANs is attractive even for these models . Figure 3 further outlines this distinction . We emphasize that our methods are quite general , and any model that generates discrete choices and response times from which simulations can be drawn within a reasonable amount of time can be suitable to the amortization techniques discussed in this paper ( given that the model has parameter vectors of dimension roughly lt15 ) . In fact , LANs are not restricted to models of reaction time and choice to begin with , even though we focus on these as test beds . As a general principle , all models tested below are based on stochastic differential equations ( SDEs ) of the following form:d⁢𝐗t=a⁢ ( t , x ) ⁢d⁢t+b⁢ ( t , x ) ⁢d⁢𝐁t , 𝐗0=wwhere we are concerned with the probabilistic behavior of the particle ( or vector of particles ) 𝐗 . The behavior of this particle is driven by a⁢ ( t , x ) , an underlying drift function , b⁢ ( t , x ) , an underlying noise transformation function , Bt , an incremental noise process , and X0=w , a starting point . Of interest to us are specifically the properties of the first-passage-time-distributions ( FPTD ) for such processes , which are needed to compute the likelihood of a given response time/choice pair {r⁢t , c} . In these models , the exit region of the particle ( i . e . , the specific boundary it reaches ) determines the choice , and the time point of that exit determines the response time . The joint distribution of choices and reaction times is referred to as a FPTD . Given some exit region ℰ , such FPTDs are formally defined asfℰ ( t ) =p ( infτ{ ( Xτ∈ℰ ) }=t ) In words , a first passage time , for a given exit region , is defined as the first time point of entry into the exit region , and the FPTD is the probability , respectively , of such an exit happening at any specified time t ( Ratcliff , 1978; Feller , 1968 ) . Partitioning the exit region into subsets ℰ1 , … . , ℰn ( e . g . , representing n choices ) , we can now define the set of defective distributions{fℰ1⁢ ( t;θ ) , … , fℰN⁢ ( t;θ ) }where θ∈Θ describes the collection of parameters driving the process . For every ℰi , ∫[0 , +∞]fℰi⁢ ( t;θ ) ⁢𝑑t=P⁢ ( 𝐗⁢exits into⁢ℰi ) =P⁢ ( i⁢gets chosen ) {fℰ𝒾 , … , fℰ𝓃} jointly define the FPTD such that∑i=1n∫[0 , +∞]fℰi⁢ ( t;θ ) ⁢𝑑t=1 These functions fℰi , jointly serve as the likelihood function s . t . ℓ⁢ ( θ;{r⁢t , c} ) =fℰc⁢ ( t;θ ) For illustration , we focus the general model formulation above to the standard DDM . Details regarding the other models in our test bed are relegated to the 'Materials and methods' section . To obtain the DDM from the general equation above , we set a⁢ ( t , x ) =v ( a fixed drift across time ) , b⁢ ( t , x ) =1 ( a fixed noise variance across time ) , and Δ⁢𝐁∼𝒩⁢ ( 0 , Δ⁢t ) . The DDM applies to the two alternative decision cases , where decision corresponds to the particle crossings of an upper or lower fixed boundary . Hence , ℰ1={ℝ≥a} and ℰ2={ℝ≤-a} , where a is a parameter of the model . The DDM also includes a normalized starting point w ( capturing potential response biases or priors ) , and finally a nondecision time τ ( capturing the time for perceptual encoding and motor output ) . Hence , the parameter vector for the DDM is then θ= ( v , a , w , τ ) . The SDE is defined asd⁢𝐗τ+t=v⁢d⁢t+d⁢𝐖 , 𝐗τ=w The DDM serves principally as a basic proof of concept for us , in that it is a model for which we can compute the exact likelihoods analytically ( Feller , 1968; Navarro and Fuss , 2009 ) . The other models chosen for our test bed systematically relax some of the fixed assumptions of the basic DDM , as illustrated in Figure 3 . We note that many new models can be constructed from the components tested here . As an example of this modularity , we introduce inhibition/excitation to the race model , which gives us the leaky competing accumulator ( LCA ) ( Usher and McClelland , 2001 ) . We could then further extend this model by introducing parameterized bounds . We could introduce reinforcement learning parameters to a DDM ( Pedersen and Frank , 2020 ) or in combination with any of the other decision models . Again we emphasize that while these diffusion-based models provide a large test bed for our proposed methods , applications are in no way restricted to this class of models . 2 Results Across epochs of training , both training and validation loss decrease rapidly and remain low ( Figure 4A ) suggesting that overfitting is not an issue , which is sensible in this context . The low validation loss further shows that the network can interpolate likelihoods to specific parameter values it has not been exposed to ( with the caveat that it has to be exposed to the same range; no claims are made about extrapolation ) . Indeed , a simple interrogation of the learned likelihood manifolds shows that they smoothly vary in an interpretable fashion with respect to changes in generative model parameters ( Figure 4B ) . Moreover , Figure 4C shows that the MLP likelihoods mirror those obtained by KDEs using 100 , 000 simulations , even though the model parameter vectors were drawn randomly and thus not trained per se . We also note that the MLP likelihoods appropriately filter out simulation noise ( random fluctuations in the KDE empirical likelihoods across separate simulation runs of 100⁢K samples each ) . This observation can also be gleaned from Figure 4C , which shows the learned likelihood to sit right at the center of sampled KDEs ( note that for each subplot 100 such KDEs were used ) . As illustrated in the Appendix , these observations hold across all tested models . One perspective on this is to consider the MLP likelihoods as equivalent to KDE likelihoods derived from a much larger number of underlying samples and interpolated . The results for the CNN ( not shown to avoid redundancy ) mirror the MLP results . Finally , while Figure 4 depicts the learned likelihood for the simple DDM for illustration purposes , the same conclusions apply to the learned manifolds for all of the tested models ( as shown in Appendix 1—figures 1–6 ) . Indeed inspection of those manifolds is insightful for facilitating interpretation of the dynamics of the underlying models , how they differ from each other , and the corresponding RT distributions that can be captured . Figure 7 shows that both the MLP and CNN methods consistently yield very good to excellent parameter recovery performance for the LC model , with parameter-wise regression coefficients globally above R2>0 . 9 . As shown in Figure 8 , parameter recovery for the Weibull model is less successful , however , particularly for the Weibull collapsing bound parameters . The drift parameter v , the starting point bias w , and the nondecision time are estimated well; however , the boundary parameters a , α , and β are less well recovered by the posterior mean . Judging by the parameter recovery plot , the MLP seems to perform slightly less well on the boundary parameters when compared to the CNN . To interrogate the source of the poor recovery of α and β parameters , we considered the possibility that the model itself may have issues with identifiability , rather than poor fit . Figure 8 shows that indeed , for two representative datasets in which these parameters are poorly recovered , the model nearly perfectly reproduces the ground truth data in the posterior predictive RT distributions . Moreover , we find that whereas the individual Weibull parameters are poorly recovered , the net boundary B⁢ ( t ) is very well recovered , particularly when evaluated within the range of the observed dataset . This result is reminiscent of the literature on sloppy models ( Gutenkunst et al . , 2007 ) , where sloppiness implies that various parameter configurations can have the same impact on the data . Moreover , two further conclusions can be drawn from this analysis . First , when fitting the Weibull model , researchers should interpret the bound trajectory as a latent parameter rather than the individual α and β parameters per se . Second , the Weibull model may be considered as viable only if the estimated bound trajectory varies sufficiently within the range of the empirical RT distributions . If the bound is instead flat or linearly declining in that range , the simple DDM or LC models may be preferred , and their simpler form would imply that they would be selected by any reasonable model comparison metric . Lastly , given our results the Weibull model could likely benefit from reparameterization if the desire is to recover individual parameters rather than the bound trajectory B⁢ ( t ) . Given the common use of this model in collapsing bound studies ( Hawkins et al . , 2015 ) and that the bound trajectories are nevertheless interpretable , we leave this issue for future work . The Appendix shows parameter recovery studies on a number of other stochastic simulators with non-analytical likelihoods , described in the 'Test bed' section . The appendices show tables of parameter-wise recovery R2 for all models tested . In general , recovery ranges from good to excellent . Given the Weibull results above , we attribute the less good recovery for some of these models to identifiability issues and specific dataset properties rather than to the method per se . We note that our parameter recovery studies here are in general constrained to the simplest inference setting equivalent to a single-subject , single-condition experimental design . Moreover , we use uninformative priors for all parameters of all models . Thus , these results provide a lower bound on parameter recoverability , provided of course that the datasets were generated from the valid parameter ranges on which the networks were trained; see Section 0 . 10 for how recovery can benefit from more complex experimental designs with additional task conditions , which more faithfully represents the typical inference scenario deployed by cognitive neuroscientists . Lastly , some general remarks about the parameter recovery performance . A few factors can negatively impact how well one can recover parameters . First , if the model generally suffers from identifiability issues , the resulting tradeoffs in the parameters can lead the MCMC chain to get stuck on the boundary for one or more parameters . This issue is endemic to all models and unrelated to likelihood-free methods or LANs , and should at best be attacked at the level of reparameterization ( or a different experimental design that can disentangle model parameters ) . Second , if the generative parameters of a dataset are too close to ( or beyond ) the bounds of the trained parameter space , we may also end with a chain that gets stuck on the boundary of the parameter space . We confronted this problem by training on parameter spaces that yield response time distributions that are broader than typically observed experimentally for models of this class , while also excluding obviously defective parameter setups . Defective parameter setups were defined in the context of our applications as parameter vectors that generate data that never allow one or the other choice to occur ( as in p⁢ ( c ) ≪1100 , 000 , data that concentrates more than half of the reaction times within a single 1 ms bin and data that generated mean reaction times beyond 10 s ) . These guidelines were chosen as a mix of basic rationale and domain knowledge regarding usual applications of DDMs to experimental data . As such , the definition of defective data may depend on the model under consideration . A major motivation for this work is the amortization of network training time during inference , affording researchers the ability to test a variety of theoretically interesting models for linking brain and behavior without large computational cost . To quantify this advantage , we provide some results on the posterior sampling runtimes using ( 1 ) the MLP with slice sampling ( Neal , 2003 ) and ( 2 ) CNN with iterated importance sampling . The MLP timings are based on slice sampling ( Neal , 2003 ) , with a minimum of n=2000 samples . The sampler was stopped at some n≥2000 , for which the Geweke statistic ( Geweke , 1992 ) indicated convergence ( the statistic was computed once every 100 samples for n≥2000 ) . Using an alternative sampler , based on differential evolution Markov chain Monte Carlo ( DEMCMC ) and stopped when the Gelman–Rubin R^<1 . 1 ( Gelman and Rubin , 1992 ) , yielded very similar timing results and was omitted in our figures . For the reported importance sampling runs , we used 200K importance samples per iteration , starting with γ values of 64 , which was first reduced to 1 where in iteration i , γi=642i-1 , before a stopping criterion based on relative improvement of the confusion metric was used . Figure 9A shows that all models can be estimated in the order of hundreds of seconds ( minutes ) , comprising a speed improvement of at least two orders of magnitude compared to traditional ABC methods using KDE during inference ( i . e . , the PDA method motivating this work; Turner et al . , 2015 ) . Indeed , this estimate is a lower bound on the speed improvement: we extrapolate only the observed difference between network evaluation and online simulations , ignoring the additional cost of constructing and evaluating the KDE-based likelihood . We decided to use this benchmark because it provides a fairer comparison to more recent PDA approaches in which the KDE evaluations can be sped up considerably ( Holmes , 2015 ) . Notably , due to its potential for parallelization ( especially on GPUs ) , our NN methods can even induce performance speedups relative to analytical likelihood evaluations . Indeed , Figure 9B shows that as the dataset grows runtime is significantly faster than even a highly optimized cython implementation of the Navarro Fuss algorithm ( Navarro and Fuss , 2009 ) for evaluation of the analytic DDM likelihood . This is also noteworthy in light of the full-DDM ( as described in the 'Test bed' section ) , for which it is currently common to compute the likelihood term via quadrature methods , in turn based on repeated evaluations of the Navarro Fuss algorithm . This can easily inflate the evaluation time by 1–2 orders of magnitude . In contrast , evaluation times for the MLP and CNN are only marginally slower ( as a function of the slightly larger network size in response to higher dimensional inputs ) . We confirm ( omitted as separate figure ) from experiments with the HDDM Python toolbox that our methods end up approximately 10-50 times faster for the full-DDM than the current implementation based on numerical integration , maintaining comparable parameter recovery performance . We strongly suspect there to be additional remaining potential for performance optimization . One of the principal benefits of LANs is that they can be directly extended – without further training – to arbitrary hierarchical inference scenarios , including those in which ( 1 ) individual participant parameters are drawn from group distributions , ( 2 ) some parameters are pooled and others separated across task conditions , and ( 3 ) neural measures are estimated as regressors on model parameters ( Figure 10 ) . Hierarchical inference is critical for improving parameter estimation particularly for realistic cognitive neuroscience datasets in which thousands of trials are not available for each participant and/or where one estimates impacts of noisy physiological signals onto model parameters ( Wiecki et al . , 2013; Boehm et al . , 2018; Vandekerckhove et al . , 2011; Ratcliff and Childers , 2015 ) . To provide a proof of concept , we developed an extension to the HDDM Python toolbox ( Wiecki et al . , 2013 ) , widely used for hierarchical inference of the DDM applied to such settings . Lifting the restriction of previous versions of HDDM to only DDM variants with analytical likelihoods , we imported the MLP likelihoods for all two-choice models considered in this paper . Note that GPU-based computation is supported out of the box , which can easily be exploited with minimal overhead using free versions of Google’s Colab notebooks . We generally observed GPUs to improve speed approximately fivefold over CPU-based setups for the inference scenarios we tested . Preliminary access to this interface and corresponding instructions can be found at https://github . com/lnccbrown/lans/tree/master/hddmnn_tutorial ( copy archived at swh:1:rev:e3369b9df138c75d0e490be0c48c53ded3e3a1d6 ) ; Fengler , 2021 . Figure 11 shows example results from hierarchical inference using the LC model , applied to synthetic datasets comprising 5 and 20 subjects ( a superset of participants ) . Recovery of individual parameters was adequate even for five participants , and we also observe the expected improvement of recovery of the group-level parameters μ and σ for 20 participants . Figure 12 shows an example that illustrates how parameter recovery is affected when a dataset contains multiple experimental conditions ( e . g . , different difficulty levels ) . It is common in such scenarios to allow task conditions to affect a single ( or subset ) -model parameter ( in the cases shown: v ) , while other model parameters are pooled across conditions . As expected , for both the full-DDM ( A ) and the Levy model ( B ) , the estimation of global parameters is improved when increasing the number of conditions from 1 to 5 to 10 ( left to right , where the former are subsets of the latter datasets ) . These experiments confirm that one can more confidently estimate parameters that are otherwise difficult to estimate such as the noise α in the Levy model and s⁢v the standard deviation of the drift in the full-DDM . Both of these experiments provide evidence that our MLPs provide approximate likelihoods which behave in accordance with what is expected from proper analytical methods , while also demonstrating their robustness to other samplers ( i . e . , we used HDDM slice samplers without further modification for all models ) . We expect that proper setting of prior distributions ( uniform in our examples ) and further refinements to the slice sampler settings ( to help mode discovery ) can improve these results even further . We include only the MLP method in this section since it is most immediately amenable to the kind of trial-by-trial-level analysis that HDDM is designed for . We plan to investigate the feasibility of including the CNN method into HDDM in future projects . 3 Discussion There are several limitations of the methods presented in this paper , which we hope to address in future work . While allowing for great flexibility , the MLP approach suffers from the drawback that we do not enforce ( or exploit ) the constraint that ℓ^⁢ ( θ|𝐱 ) is a valid probability distribution , and hence the networks have to learn this constraint implicitly and approximately . Enforcing this constraint has the potential to improve estimation of tail probabilities ( a known issue for KDE approaches to ABC more generally; Turner et al . , 2015 ) . The CNN encapsulation exploits the fact that ∫𝒳ℓ^⁢ ( θ|𝐱 ) ⁢𝑑𝐱=1 , however , makes estimation of trial-by-trial effects more resource hungry . We plan to investigate the potential of the CNN for trial-by-trial estimation in future research . A potential solution that combines the strengths of both the CNN and MLP methods is to utilize mixture density networks to encapsulate the likelihood functions . We are currently exploring this avenue . Mixture density networks have been successfully applied in the context of ABC ( Papamakarios and Murray , 2016 ) ; however , training can be unstable without extra care ( Guillaumes , 2017 ) . Similarly , invertible flows ( Rezende and Mohamed , 2015 ) and/or mixture density networks Bishop , 1994 may be used to learn likelihood functions ( Papamakarios et al . , 2019b; Lueckmann et al . , 2019 ) ; however , the philosophy remains focused on distributions of summary statistics for single datasets . While impressive improvements have materialized at the intersection of ABC and deep learning methods ( Papamakarios et al . , 2019a; Greenberg et al . , 2019; Gonçalves et al . , 2020 ) ( showing some success with posterior amortization for models up to 30 parameters , but restricted to a local region of high posterior density in the resulting parameter space ) , generally less attention has been paid to amortization methods that are not only of case-specific efficiency but sufficiently modular to serve a large variety of inference scenarios ( e . g . , Figure 10 ) . This is an important gap that we believe the popularization of the powerful ABC framework in the domain of experimental science hinges upon . A second and short-term avenue for future work is the incorporation of our presented methods into the HDDM Python toolbox ( Wiecki et al . , 2013 ) to extend its capabilities to a larger variety of SSMs . Initial work in this direction has been completed , the alpha version of the extension being available in the form of a tutorial at https://github . com/lnccbrown/lans/tree/master/hddmnn_tutorial . Our current training pipeline can be further optimized on two fronts . First , no attempt was made to minimize the size of the network needed to reliably approximate likelihood functions so as to further improve computational speed . Second , little attempt was made to optimize the amount of training provided to networks . For the models explored here , we found it sufficient to simply train the networks for a very large number of simulated datapoints such that interpolation across the manifold was possible . However , as model complexity increases , it would be useful to obtain a measure of the networks’ uncertainty over likelihood estimates for any given parameter vector . Such uncertainty estimates would be beneficial for multiple reasons . One such benefit would be to provide a handle on the reliability of sampling , given the parameter region . Moreover , such uncertainty estimates could be used to guide the online generation of training data to train the networks in regions with high uncertainty . At the intersection of ABC and NNs , active learning has been explored via uncertainty estimates based on network ensembles ( Lueckmann et al . , 2019 ) . We plan to additionally explore the use of Bayesian NNs , which provide uncertainty over their weights , for this purpose ( Neal , 1995 ) . One more general shortcoming of our methods is the reliance on empirical likelihoods for training , which in turn are based on a fixed number of samples across parameter vectors , just as the PDA method proposed by Turner et al . , 2015 . Recently , this approach has been criticized fundamentally on grounds of producing bias in the generated KDE-based likelihood estimates ( van Opheusden et al . , 2020 ) . A reduction of the approximate likelihood problem to one of inverse binomial sampling was proposed ( van Opheusden et al . , 2020 ) , which will generate unbiased likelihood estimates . To address this concern , we will investigate adaptive strategies for the selection of the simulations count n . We however highlight two points here that aim to put the promise of unbiased likelihoods in perspective . First , our networks add interpolation to the actual estimation of a likelihood . Likelihoods close in parameter space therefore share information that translates into an effectively higher simulation count than the 100k chosen to construct each empirical likelihood used for training . Quantifying this benefit precisely we leave for future research; however , we suspect , as suggested by Figure 4 , that it may be substantial . Second , while we generally acknowledge that bias in the tails remains somewhat of an issue in our approach , resolution is at best partial even in the proposed methods of van Opheusden et al . , 2020 . For the estimation of parameters for which a given datapoint is extremely unlikely ( i . e . , the data is generally unlikely under the model ) , the authors suggest to threshold the simulation count so that their algorithm is guaranteed to stop . This effectively amounts to explicitly allowing for bias again . As another alternative , the authors suggest to introduce a lapse rate in the generative model , which the LAN approach can accommodate as well . However , the introduction of a lapse rate does not deal with tail events directly either , but rather assumes that tail events are unrelated to the process of interest . This in turn will render a lower but fixed number of simulations N feasible for training LANs as well . This is notwithstanding the desirable minimization of simulation times even for high likelihood events , especially when trial-wise simulations are in fact necessary ( which tends to be in cases where amortization with LANs is a priori not a good computational strategy to begin with ) . Hence , although the inverse binomial sampling approach is elegant conceptually , excessive computation remains an issue when we need accurate estimates of the probability of actual tail events . Generally , however , we maintain it is desirable and important for future work to make use of the otherwise great potential of adaptive sampling to minimize total computational cost . Furthermore , we relegate to future research proper exploitation of the fact that LANs are by design differentiable in the parameters . We are currently working on an integration of LANs with Tensorflow probability ( Abadi et al . , 2016 ) , utilizing autograd to switch our MCMC method to the gradient-based NUTS sampler ( Hoffman and Gelman , 2014 ) . The main benefits of this sampler are robust mixing behavior , tolerance for high levels of correlations in the parameter space , while at the same time maintaining the ability to sample from high-dimensional posteriors . High level of correlations in posteriors is traditionally an Achilles' heel of the otherwise robust coordinate-wise slice samplers . DEMCMC and iterated Importance samplers are somewhat more robust in this regards; however , both may not scale efficiently to high-dimensional problems . Robustness concerns aside , initial numerical results additionally show some promising further speedups . Another important branch for future work lies in the utilization of LANs for model comparison . Initial results are promising in that we obtained satisfactory model recovery using the deviance information criterion ( DIC ) used for model selection in the standard HDDM package . However , this issue demands much more attention to evaluate other model selection metrics and extensive further numerical experiments , which we relegate to future work . Lastly , in contrast to the importance sampler driving the posterior inference for the CNN , we believe that some of the performance deficiencies of the MLP are the result of our MCs not having converged to the target distribution . A common problem seems to be that the sampler hits the bounds of the constrained parameter space and does not recover from that . As shown in Figures 7 and 8 , even ostensibly bad parameter recoveries follow a conceptual coherence and lead to good posterior predictive performance . We therefore may be underreporting the performance of the MLP and plan to test the method on an even more comprehensive suite of MCMC samplers , moreover including thus far neglected potential for reparameterization . 4 Materials and methods The Race model departs from previous model formulations in that it has a particle for each of N choice options instead of a single particle representing the evidence for one option over another . The function fEi⁢ ( t , θ ) now represents the probability of particle i to be the first of all particle to cross the bound a at time t . We consider race models for which the drift and starting point can vary for each particle separately . Treating the boundary as a constant a leaves us with a parameter vector θ= ( v1 , . . . , vn , a , w1 , . . . , wn , ndt ) . The SDE is defined for each particle separately ( or in vector form ) asd⁢𝐗τ+ti=vi⁢d⁢t+d⁢𝐖 , 𝐗0i=…=𝐗τi=wi These models represent the most straightforward extension to a multichoice scenario . In this section , we clarify a few strengths and weaknesses of the two presented methods and their respective use cases . First , representing the likelihood function datapoint-wise as an MLP output , or globally via the CNN output histogram , affects the potential for parallelization . As exploited by the choice of sampler , the CNN is very amenable to parallelization across parameters since inputs are parameter tuples only . Since the output is represented as a global likelihood histogram , the dataset likelihood is computed as the summation of the elementwise multiplied of bin-log-likelihoods , with a correspondingly binned dataset ( counts over bins ) . This has the highly desirable property of making evaluation cost ( time ) independent of dataset size . While the MLP in principle allows parallel processing of inputs , the datapoint-wise representation of input values ( {θ , x} ) makes the potential for cross-parameter parallelization dependent on dataset sizes . While a single evaluation of the CNN is more costly , cross-parameter batch processing can make it preferable to the MLP . Second , the CNN has an advantage during training , where the representation of the output as a softmax layer , and corresponding training via minimization of the KL divergence , provides a more robust training signal to ensure probability distributions compared to the purely local one in which the MLP learns a scalar likelihood output as a simple regression problem . Third , and conversely , the MLP formulation is more natural for trial-wise parameter estimates since the histogram representations may be redundant in case datapoints are in fact evaluated one by one ( given datapoint-wise parameters induced by trial-by-trial effects on parameter vectors ) . Give equivalent success in learning likelihoods , we see potential for speedup when using the pointwise approach in this case . In principle , both approaches however allow one to estimate the impact of trial-wise regressors on model parameters during inference , without further training . It is , for example , common in the cognitive neuroscience literature to allow the cross-trial time-course of EEG , fMRI , or spike signals to be modeled as a trial-by-trial regressor on model parameters of , for example , DDMs ( Wiecki et al . , 2013; Frank et al . , 2015; Cavanagh et al . , 2011; Herz et al . , 2016; Pedersen and Frank , 2020 ) . Another relevant example is the incorporation of latent learning dynamics . If a subject’s choice behavior is driven by reinforcement learning across stimuli , we can translate this into trial-by-trial effects on the parameter vectors of a generative process model ( Pedersen and Frank , 2020 ) . These applications are implicitly enabled at no extra cost with the MLP method , while the trial-by-trial split multiplies the necessary computations for the CNN by the number N of datapoints when compared to scenarios that only need dataset-wise parameters . We stress again , however , that in general both the CNN and the MLP can directly be used for hierarchical inference scenarios . The preceding discussion pertains to further potential for optimization and relative strengths , not categorical potential for application to a given scenario . With respect to the latter , both methods are essentially equal ."}

Despite this , the extent and function of lung EC heterogeneity remains incompletely understood .

These studies map EC heterogeneity in the adult lung and characterize the response of novel EC subpopulations required for tissue regeneration after acute lung injury .", "plain language summary": "Animal lungs are filled with tiny air sacks called alveoli , where the gas exchanges that keep organisms alive can take place . Small blood vessels known as capillaries come in close contact with the alveoli , allowing oxygen to be extracted from the air into the blood , and carbon dioxide to be released from the blood into the air . The cells that line the inside of these capillaries ( known as pulmonary endothelial cells ) are important actors in these exchanges . After having been damaged , for example by viruses like influenza , the lungs need to regenerate and create new capillaries . Yet , it was still unclear how pulmonary endothelial cells participate in the healing process , and if capillaries contain several populations of endothelial cells that play different roles . To investigate this question , Niethamer et al . used an approach called single-cell analytics to examine individual endothelial cells in the alveoli of mice infected with influenza . This revealed that different subtypes of endothelial cells exist in capillaries , and that some may be able to perform slightly different jobs during lung recovery . Niethamer et al . found that all subtypes could quickly multiply after injury to create more endothelial cells and re-establish gas exchanges . However , one newly identified group ( called Car4-high ECs ) was particularly primed to receive orders from damaged alveoli . These cells were also often found at the sites where the alveoli were most injured . Lung injuries are a major cause of death worldwide . Understanding how pulmonary endothelial cells work when the organ is both healthy and injured should help to find ways to boost repair , and to create therapies that could target these cells .", "article": "1 Introduction The primary function of the respiratory system is to exchange oxygen and other gases with the external environment . The functional compartment or niche responsible for gas exchange in the lungs is called the alveolus and is comprised of multiple epithelial , endothelial , and mesenchymal cell lineages . The pulmonary vascular plexus interacts intimately with alveolar type 1 ( AT1 ) cells to form a very thin , gas-diffusible interface . The lung alveolus and its gas-exchange function is seriously disrupted upon acute lung injury such as occurs during a viral infection ( Gregory and Kobzik , 2015; Herold et al . , 2015; Kash and Taubenberger , 2015; Kumar et al . , 2011; Pociask et al . , 2017; Zacharias et al . , 2018 ) . Despite the functional importance of the lung alveolus , only recently have studies begun to elucidate its overall cellular complexity ( Cohen et al . , 2018; Ding et al . , 2018; He et al . , 2018; Montoro et al . , 2018; Plasschaert et al . , 2018; Reyfman et al . , 2019; Sabbagh et al . , 2018; Treutlein et al . , 2014; Xie et al . , 2018; Xu et al . , 2016; Zacharias et al . , 2018; Zepp et al . , 2017 ) . An improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms of alveolar regeneration is critical for the development of targeted therapies that induce or improve this process to restore functional gas exchange in pulmonary disease or following acute injury to the lung . Previous work has demonstrated that acute or serious lung injury can lead to the generation of dense epithelial remodeling resulting in hypoxic vasoconstriction in regions of severe damage ( Xi et al . , 2017 ) . Proper tissue regeneration in the lung requires neovascularization of the alveolar region , and previous work has suggested that certain EC populations may be primed for proliferation when cultured in vitro ( Alvarez et al . , 2008; Lee et al . , 2017; Taha et al . , 2017 ) . Cell surface markers such as CD34 and CD309 are enriched on mouse ECs that proliferate in culture ( Alvarez et al . , 2008; Asahara et al . , 1997 ) . Putative EC progenitors can be isolated from the peripheral blood or the liver and transplanted into injured regions to contribute to regeneration ( Asahara et al . , 1997; Wakabayashi et al . , 2018 ) . However , whether such EC subpopulations contribute to in vivo tissue homeostasis and response to injury in the adult lung remains unknown . To address these questions and to define pulmonary EC heterogeneity at homeostasis and during regeneration , we utilized single cell RNA sequencing ( scRNA-seq ) analysis of the adult mouse lung , both uninjured and after acute influenza-induced viral injury . In addition to identifying microvascular ( miEC ) and both arterial and venous macrovascular ( maEC ) populations , we identified a new population we have termed Car4-high ECs that possess a unique transcriptome . Car4-high ECs express high levels of Car4 and Cd34 , are found throughout the lung periphery at homeostasis , and are primed to respond to Vegfa signaling based on their high expression of Vegf receptors , which corresponds to a receptor-ligand interaction analysis between Car4-high ECs and AT1 cells , their epithelial co-partners in gas exchange . Car4-high ECs are enriched in the regenerating zones surrounding the most damaged regions of the lung following influenza- or bleomycin-induced lung injury during the subsequent tissue regeneration process . Influenza injury revealed the emergence of a unique population of highly proliferative ECs , which are closely related to Car4-low miECs in gene expression but likely arise from multiple EC populations to contribute to regeneration of the pulmonary vasculature after injury by replacing lost endothelium . These data provide critical insight into lung EC heterogeneity and the key roles that differing subtypes of pulmonary ECs play in the response to acute lung injury . 2 Results To define the heterogeneity of the adult pulmonary endothelium , we employed scRNA-seq analysis . We used the pan-endothelial marker CD31 ( Pecam1 ) to isolate ECs ( CD45-/CD31+ ) by FACS and sequenced using the 10X Genomics platform ( Figure 1A ) . We identified seven separate clusters , which are displayed using UMAP dimension reduction technique ( Figure 1B; Becht et al . , 2018 ) . Each of the seven clusters was consistently identified across three biological replicates; clusters 5 and 6 represent a small amount of mesenchymal and epithelial contamination , respectively ( Figure 1—figure supplements 1 and 2 ) . Of the remaining 5 EC clusters , clusters 2 and 4 were the most distinct and exhibited significant transcriptional differences from the other clusters ( Figure 1C ) . Cluster two was characterized by high expression of Car4 , Ednrb , Kdr , and Cd34 ( Figure 1D; Table 1 ) , whereas cluster four exhibited enhanced expression of genes related to maECs , such as Vwf and Vcam1 . The other EC clusters ( 0 , 1 , and 3 ) expressed genes related to miECs , such as Gpihbp1 , Ifi47 , Plvap , and Sox17 ( Figure 1D ) . Isolation of cells comprising cluster two using a CD34 antibody ( CD45-/CD31+/CD34-high ) and comparison to other ECs ( CD45-/CD31+/CD34-low ) by qRT-PCR confirmed that at the population level , these cells express higher levels of Cd34 , Car4 , Ednrb , and Kdr , but comparable levels of other EC genes such as Pecam1 , Plvap , Gpihbp1 , and Vwf ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3 ) . The well-defined transcriptional signature of the cells composing cluster two indicates that the heterogeneity of the adult pulmonary endothelium at homeostasis extends beyond the distinction of maECs and miECs to include a transcriptionally distinct population of ECs with unknown functional relevance . To understand differences in EC clusters at a functional level , we further characterized gene expression similarities and differences between clusters . A comparison of the overlap in Gene Ontology ( GO ) between clusters ( Figure 2A ) reveals similarity in both gene expression and GO between clusters 1 and 3 as well as between 3 and 4 . Cluster two has little similarity with most other clusters , suggesting that this is a distinct cell population rather than a subset of a larger population . We also examined the top twenty GO categories across clusters ( Figure 2B ) . Cluster one is uniquely enriched in genes involved in cellular response to interferon-beta , and cluster three is dominated by expression of genes that regulate translation , whereas cluster four exhibits high expression of genes involved in regulation of cell adhesion . Clusters 0 and 2 share enhanced expression of genes related to sprouting angiogenesis and blood vessel development . Cluster two is uniquely enriched in genes that are associated with vasculogenesis . Based on their gene expression signatures , we grouped the ECs into three main categories: 1 ) maECs ( cluster 4 ) , 2 ) miECs ( clusters 0 , 1 and 3 ) , and Car4-high ECs ( cluster 2 ) ( Figure 2C–E ) . Although we would expect to isolate all ECs using a CD45-/CD31+ cell isolation strategy , we did not find Prox1+ lymphatic ECs in this analysis , possibly because these cells were lost during single-cell isolation or preparation for sequencing . To spatially locate the cell types of each cluster within the lung , we performed immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) for proteins encoded by representative genes expressed within each cluster . Immunostaining for Vwf and Vcam1 reveals that these proteins localize to the large vessel endothelium as previously reported ( Piali et al . , 1995; Yamamoto et al . , 1998 ) , with Vcam1 also present in the surrounding mesenchyme ( Figure 2C ) . Immunostaining for Gpihbp1 and Plvap shows that both proteins are highly enriched in alveolar capillary plexus endothelium , with Plvap also present in large vessel endothelium , consistent with the scRNA-seq analysis ( Figure 2D ) . IHC for CD34 and Car4 shows that both proteins are expressed in the alveolar region . The differences in gene expression between EC populations demonstrate that there may be functional relevance to heterogeneity within the pulmonary endothelium and within the alveolar capillary plexus . As the Car4-high EC population expressed high levels of Vegfr2 and Ednrb , we sought to determine whether they contributed to alveolar regeneration following tissue damage . We employed an H1N1 influenza virus injury model , which causes heterogeneous injury similar to that of human influenza ( Kumar et al . , 2011; Töpfer et al . , 2014; Zacharias et al . , 2018 ) . Control mice treated with intranasal PBS maintain normal alveolar structure ( Figure 3A , A’ ) , but the lungs of influenza-infected mice 14 days post infection ( dpi ) show regions of mild injury ( ‘zones 1/2’ ) ( Figure 3B , B’ ) as well as regions of diffuse alveolar damage ( ‘zone 3’ ) ( Figure 3B , B’’ ) and total alveolar destruction ( ‘zone 4’ ) ( Figure 3B’’ , dotted yellow line ) ( Zacharias et al . , 2018 ) . Evaluation of localization of CD31+ and CD34+ cells in control and damaged lungs by IHC revealed striking differences after influenza infection . In control lungs , CD34+ cells were found distributed throughout the alveolar space , in a similar distribution to CD31+/CD34-low miECs ( Figure 3C ) . In alveolar space adjacent to the regions of diffuse alveolar damage after influenza infection , a dramatic increase in CD34 protein ( Figure 3D , E ) suggests that these cells may participate in repair and regeneration of damaged alveoli . To determine whether the response of Car4-high ECs during regeneration occurs across different types of lung injury , we also employed an intratracheal bleomycin injury model ( Adamson , 1976; Adamson and Bowden , 1974 ) . Examination of bleomycin-injured lungs at 7 , 14 , and 21 days post injury ( dpi ) reveals extensive alveolar damage and inflammatory infiltration , with more extensive damage observed at 14 and 21 dpi ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–C , G ) . Immunostaining for CD31 and CD34 demonstrated that CD34 expression in the areas of dense injury is located within compacted vessels and is more diffuse compared to control lungs ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1D–F ) . Taken together , these data indicate that damage to the alveolar space through either influenza infection or bleomycin injury results in increased CD34+ cells in areas adjacent to the greatest tissue damage , suggesting that these cells may play a role in regeneration of injured alveoli . To further investigate the localization of EC subtypes at homeostasis and after influenza injury and to quantify numbers of Car4-high ECs across zones of injury , we employed RNAscope analysis of control and H1N1-injured tissue . Similar to IHC analysis for CD34/CD31 , multiplex RNAscope analysis using probes against Car4 and Pecam1 revealed that Car4+/Pecam+ double-positive cells localize throughout the alveolar space at homeostasis; however , not all Pecam1+ cells in the alveolar space are Car4+ ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2A ) . A subset of both Car4-high ( Car4+/Pecam+ double-positive ) ECs and other ( Car4-/Pecam+ ) ECs are found adjacent to Hopx+ AT1 cells as well as Sftpc+ alveolar type 2 ( AT2 ) epithelial cells ( Figure 3—figure supplement 3 ) . This analysis does not suggest , but also does not rule out , a preferential interaction of Car4-high ECs with AT1 or AT2 cells . At 14 days post H1N1 influenza injury , quantitative analysis of Car4+/Pecam+ double-positive cells in different zones of injury ( Zacharias et al . , 2018 ) demonstrated an increase in number of double-positive cells in regions of mild to moderate injury ( zones 1/2 ) ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2B , D ) as well as in regions adjacent to severe alveolar damage ( zone 3 ) ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2C , D ) . Relatively few double-positive cells were observed in regions of alveolar destruction ( zone 4 ) ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2D ) , and we chose to focus on zones 1–3 , as Krt5+ cell expansion after influenza infection has been reported to result in hypoxic vasoconstriction in regions of severe alveolar damage ( Xi et al . , 2017 ) . Prior to injury , Gpihbp1+ miECs are also localized throughout the alveolar space . However , Gpihbp1+/Plvap+/Pecam1+ triple-positive cells were not found in the large vessel endothelium , where cells expressed only Plvap and Pecam1 ( Figure 3—figure supplement 4A ) . Further analysis of macrovascular ECs using probes against Cxcl12 , expressed by arterial maECs , or Vegfc , expressed by venous maECs , reveals that these cells localize to large vessels both in control animals ( Figure 3—figure supplement 4B , C ) and at 14 dpi ( Figure 3—figure supplement 4E , F ) . Gpihbp1+/Plvap+/Pecam1+ triple-positive miECs remain localized to the alveolar space at 14 dpi , with a greater density of these cells in injured tissue regions ( Figure 3—figure supplement 4D ) . These data suggest that both Car4-high ECs and Gpihbp1+ miECs may play a role in response to alveolar injury based on changes to their localization or density during the regenerative period following H1N1 influenza infection . To understand how Car4-high ECs and other EC populations behave following influenza injury in the context of the entire lung and whether they undergo gene expression changes that may contribute to regeneration , we performed scRNA-seq on non-immune cells ( CD45- ) isolated from whole adult mouse lungs , both uninjured and at 14 days following H1N1 influenza infection . Histological examination of the lungs at 14 dpi revealed regions of damage compared to control lung and an increase in CD45-expressing cells indicative of an immune response to the influenza injury ( Figure 4A , B ) . We identified endothelial , epithelial , and mesenchymal cell clusters in the adult mouse lung at homeostasis and at 14 dpi , displayed using UMAP dimension reduction ( Figure 4C , D; Figure 4—figure supplements 1 and 2; Becht et al . , 2018 ) . Comparison of expression of representative genes for each cluster across all clusters demonstrates that these clusters are indeed distinct cell populations ( Figure 4—figure supplement 3 ) . Analysis of the most highly-expressed genes in each endothelial cluster demonstrated that Car4-high ECs , two populations of miECs ( Gpihbp1-high and Ifi47-high ) , and both venous and arterial maECs could be identified in both uninjured and injured lung ( Figure 4E , F ) . Of note , the whole-lung scRNA-seq analysis identified additional EC populations in comparison to the CD31+ sorted cells , likely due to a less biased isolation procedure as well as including the presence of additional non-ECs , which provides greater differences in number and transcriptional variance of cell types analyzed . For instance , the whole-lung scRNA-seq analysis generated separate arterial and venous maEC clusters . Moreover , lymphatic ECs were identified in both control and H1N1 whole-lung datasets . scRNA-seq analysis at 14 dpi also revealed a newly emergent cluster not observed at homeostasis , a population of proliferative ECs ( Figure 4D , F ) . Proliferating ECs expressed high levels of markers of proliferation such as Mki67 , Ccnb2 , Cdk1 , and Cdc20 ( Table 2 ) , but also expressed other EC markers such as Cd31 , Gpihbp1 , Plvap , and Cd34 ( Figure 4—figure supplement 4 ) . Interestingly , proliferating ECs did not express high levels of genes expressed by Car4-high ECs , such as Kdr and Ednrb , or of genes expressed by maECs , such as Vcam1 , or Vwf ( Figure 4—figure supplement 4 ) . To determine the changes in gene expression that occur in heterogeneous populations of ECs with H1N1 injury , we aggregated individual control and flu scRNA-seq datasets to generate an integrated dataset ( Figure 4—figure supplement 5A–B ) . Each individual control and H1N1-injured animal contributed to each cluster identified in the integrated dataset , with the exception of the proliferating EC population , which was composed mainly of cells from the two H1N1 datasets ( Figure 4—figure supplement 5B–E ) . Gene expression analysis of known marker genes , or genes used to identify epithelial , mesenchymal , and endothelial cell types in individual scRNA-seq datasets , also allowed us to identify these clusters in the integrated dataset ( Figure 4—figure supplement 5F ) , confirming a direct correlation between cell types identified in the uninjured and injured lungs . We further probed the integrated scRNA-seq dataset to determine how the transcriptome of EC populations may change after H1N1 injury . We first focused on Car4-high ECs . The gene expression profile of this cell type within the influenza dataset ( Table 3 ) appeared similar to that observed at homeostasis ( Table 1 ) , suggesting that these cells do not differ appreciably in gene expression following influenza . However , analysis of 12 of the top differentially expressed genes in this cluster between control and flu datasets revealed small but statistically significant decreases in expression in signaling proteins such as Acvrl1 , Adgre5 , and Thbd ( thrombomodulin , an endothelial-specific receptor that binds to thrombin ) , as well as in the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor Epas1 and in Emp2 , which positively regulates Vegfa . Genes with statistically significant increases in transcription after H1N1 influenza infection in this cluster included genes that regulate the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix , such as Sept4 and Sparc , as well as the transcription factor Hes1 ( Figure 4—figure supplement 6A ) . These expression differences suggest that in addition to an increase in number of Car4-high ECs in H1N1-injured regions of the distal lung , transcriptional changes within this cell population may contribute to regeneration . However , as expression of the genes that define this cell population in comparison to other cell types ( Tables 1 and 3 ) does not change significantly after injury , it is likely that changes in cell fate are not a dominant component of the injury response of this population . To determine global changes in gene expression across EC populations after influenza infection , we performed GO analysis on all genes differentially expressed between H1N1 and control scRNA-seq datasets across EC populations ( Figure 4—figure supplement 6B ) . This analysis revealed that ECs respond to flu by increasing transcription of genes related to translation , signaling to promote survival and proliferation , cellular response to stress , and cell death . The emergence of proliferating ECs following influenza injury led us to probe proliferation throughout the lung during at this stage of the regenerative process . We investigated the extent of EC proliferation after influenza injury by EdU incorporation in ECs from both control and H1N1-injured mice . After intranasal administration of H1N1 or PBS ( control ) , we gave mice EdU in their drinking water either from days 0–7 ( H1N1 cohort 1 ) , days 7–14 ( H1N1 cohort two and control cohort ) , or days 14–21 ( H1N1 cohort 3 ) ( Figure 5A ) . To ensure that there were no cytotoxic effects of EdU when administered over the 7 day time course , we compared proliferation by IHC for Ki67 or phospho-histone H3 in EdU-treated and -untreated animals at 14 dpi and observed no difference ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) . At the endpoint of EdU administration for each cohort , we isolated single cells from the mouse lungs and quantified %CD45+ immune cells , %CD45-/CD31+ ECs , and %EdU+ ECs using flow cytometry . As expected , H1N1 injury results in a dramatic increase in immune cells at all time points ( Figure 5B , H ) . However , the total number of CD31+ ECs did not significantly differ between control and flu cohorts ( Figure 5C , I ) , possibly because injury results in decreased ECs at a time point earlier than seven dpi . Between 7 and 14 dpi , a large proportion of ECs from H1N1-treated mice had incorporated EdU ( CD45-/CD31+/EdU+ cells ) ( Figure 5B–D ) compared to PBS treated mice ( Figure 5—figure supplement 2A–C ) . To determine which EC populations contribute to this proliferative response , we further separated CD45-/CD31+ ECs into CD34-high and CD34-low populations ( Figure 5E ) , representing Car4-high ECs and other ECs , respectively . H1N1-injured mice demonstrated EdU incorporation in both EC subpopulations from 7 to 14 dpi ( Figure 5F , G ) , whereas control animals showed very little EdU incorporation in either population ( Figure 5—figure supplement 2D–F ) . By comparing these results to those of injured mice administered EdU from days 0–7 of response to H1N1 infection ( Figure 5—figure supplement 3 ) or from days 14–21 of response to H1N1 infection ( Figure 5—figure supplement 4 ) , we found that EC proliferation in general ( Figure 5J ) , as well as proliferation within specific CD34-high and CD34-low EC populations ( Figure 5L , M ) increases significantly over the course of the injury response . Further , we observed a significant increase in the proportion of CD34-high ECs over the course of the regenerative response ( Figure 5K ) , which aligns with our observation that these cells increase in regions of mild to severe damage in the lung tissue after injury . Taken together , these data indicate that both Car4-high ECs and other ECs contribute to the proliferative response of the endothelium after acute lung injury . To determine the localization of proliferating ECs within the lung , we performed RNAscope analysis both at homeostasis and after H1N1 injury . In the control lung , Pecam1-expressing ECs coexpressing proliferation genes Top2a and Prc1 are extremely rare ( Figure 5—figure supplement 5A , D ) . However , at 14 days post-H1N1 injury , Top2a+/Pecam1+/Prc1+ triple-positive cells are significantly increased within regions of mild to moderate alveolar injury ( zones 1/2 ) ( Figure 5—figure supplement 5B , D ) as well as within regions of severe injury ( zone 3 ) ( Figure 5—figure supplement 5C , D ) adjacent to areas of total alveolar destruction . This indicates that endothelial proliferation likely contributes to repair of the pulmonary vasculature across the injured tissue . We also performed additional analysis of our scRNA-seq datasets to determine predicted cell numbers in G1 , G2/M , and S phases for each cluster based on expression of genes associated with each cell cycle phase at homeostasis and after influenza injury . Of note , this is a predictive analysis rather than a functional one and does not confirm that cells are actively cycling . In the uninjured lung , cells are predicted to be evenly distributed throughout these three states ( Figure 5—figure supplement 6A , C ) . At 14 dpi , however , a larger percentage of ECs compared to epithelial , mesenchymal , and other cell types are predicted to be in G2/M and S phases based on their gene expression profiles ( Figure 5—figure supplement 6B , D ) . Examination of individual endothelial cell types at homeostasis and after influenza injury demonstrates that the predicted cell cycle profiles of miECs , maECs , and Car4-high ECs are similar to each other at homeostasis as well as at 14 dpi but reveals an extremely high number of cells predicted to be in G2/M phase in the newly emergent proliferating EC cluster ( Figure 5—figure supplement 6E , F ) . In combination with functional proliferation studies , these transcriptomic data indicate that no individual cluster of ECs possesses preferential proliferative potential and demonstrate the ability of scRNA-seq data to predict the presence of a highly proliferative cell population . To further elucidate the origins of proliferating ECs after influenza injury , we used pseudotime analysis of endothelial populations within our H1N1 scRNA-seq dataset . The Slingshot program ( Street et al . , 2018 ) was used to infer trajectories within EC populations after influenza infection and demonstrated a close association between miECs and proliferating ECs ( Figure 6A , B ) , in agreement with our data demonstrating low expression of Cd34 and other markers of Car4-high ECs as well as high expression of miEC markers in proliferating ECs ( Figure 4—figure supplement 4 ) . Two different lineage trajectories were revealed , with curve one connecting Car4-high ECs , miECs , and proliferating ECs and curve two connecting Car4-high ECs to a different subset of miECs ( Figure 6C–D ) . Gene expression analysis along each trajectory indicates that the top genes defining expression differences along curve one include genes highly expressed in Car4-high ECs , such as Ednrb , Tbx2 , Cd34 , Car4 , and Kdr , as well as cell cycle genes highly expressed in proliferating ECs , such as Ube2c , Cdk1 , and Top2a ( Figure 6E; Figure 6—figure supplement 1 ) . The top genes defining expression differences along curve two also include genes highly expressed in Car4-high ECs , as well as genes expressed more generally throughout miECs , such as Atf3 and Nrp1 ( Figure 6F; Figure 6—figure supplement 2 ) . In combination , EdU incorporation analysis and pseudotime analysis suggest that although both CD34-high and CD34-low ECs proliferate after H1N1 injury , lineage relationships between EC subpopulations during the regenerative process may not be straightforward . These data allow for the possibility that CD34-high , Car4-high cells must undergo transcriptional changes in order to proliferate , or that proliferating miECs upregulate CD34 as they move along a differentiation trajectory to generate Car4-high ECs . Car4-high ECs may therefore represent a more differentiated or specialized cell type that participates in the regenerative process by signaling to other endothelial subsets or to epithelial and mesenchymal lineages to coordinate cell behaviors in the alveolar niche after injury , whereas endothelial proliferation is a capability possessed by all ECs . To further interrogate how the signaling abilities of Car4-high ECs may contribute to alveolar regeneration , we performed ligand-receptor interaction analysis based on our scRNA-seq dataset . We compared possible interactions of Car4-high ECs , proliferating ECs , and miECs , both with each other and with the primary epithelial lineages in the alveolus . We found that at homeostasis , the highest number of putative epithelial-endothelial interactions are predicted to occur between ligand-producing AT1 epithelial cells and Car4-high ECs or Gpihbp1-high miECs ( Figure 7A , C ) . After H1N1 influenza injury , our data indicate that signaling interactions between AT1 cells and Car4-high ECs or miECs are predicted to remain high ( Figure 7B ) . The emergent proliferating EC population is also predicted to participate in signaling interactions with AT1 cells as well as with miECs and Car4-high ECs after H1N1 influenza infection ( Figure 7D ) . These predictions indicate that endothelial-epithelial interactions are likely not restricted to Car4-high ECs , but rather are a general property of the capillary endothelium during the response to injury . We examined putative AT1-Car4-high EC interaction mediators in more detail and found that these included ECM interactions , such as between collagen and integrin alpha and beta subunits or between metalloproteases and integrins . We also identified predicted semaphorin-neuropilin 1 ( Nrp1 ) interactions , Bmp4-Bmpr2 interactions , and Fgf1-Fgfr3 interactions in addition to Vegfa-Vegfr1 ( Flt1 ) , Vegfa-Vegfr2 ( Kdr ) , and Vegfa-neuropilin 1 ( Nrp1 ) interactions ( Table 4 ) . Importantly , many of these signaling pathways have been identified as essential for vascular development and angiogenesis , and some are misregulated in pulmonary disease ( Asahara et al . , 1999b; Blanco and Gerhardt , 2013; Chao et al . , 2019; Lee et al . , 2014; Londhe et al . , 2011; Nguyen et al . , 2005; Potente and Mäkinen , 2017; Rojas-Quintero et al . , 2018; Simons et al . , 2016; White et al . , 2007 ) . Future studies to validate signaling interactions between ECs and other pulmonary cell types will allow for a more conclusive statement on the importance of this and other signaling axes in lung regeneration . In combination , our scRNA-seq data and in vivo functional validation have identified a unique population of Car4-high ECs that contribute to endothelial regeneration in the lung through proliferation and predicted signaling interactions with AT1 cells , which may be essential in both regulating homeostasis and repair of the gas-exchange interface . 3 Discussion Through single-cell analysis of the pulmonary vasculature at homeostasis and after acute lung injury , we have expanded our understanding of vascular heterogeneity in the lung and begun to elucidate the cellular mechanisms by which the vasculature contributes to alveolar regeneration after injury . In combination with transcript and protein localization , our scRNA-seq analysis identified a unique population of microvascular endothelium , the Car4-high EC . Through further characterization of these cells , we have determined that they coalesce within sites of moderate-to-severe alveolar damage after influenza infection and possess a transcriptional signature suggesting they are primed to receive signals from other alveolar cell types . Gene ontology analysis also suggests a role for these cells in vasculogenesis and blood vessel development . We additionally demonstrate the emergence of a highly proliferative EC population in the lung following influenza injury . The existence of endothelial subtypes that preferentially contribute to regeneration has been investigated in many organs , but the identity and origin of putative endothelial ‘progenitor’ cells remains a topic of debate ( Basile and Yoder , 2014 ) . In the aorta and the liver , endothelial regeneration has been attributed to small subsets of endogenous ECs with enhanced proliferative capacity ( McDonald et al . , 2018; Wakabayashi et al . , 2018 ) . Others have suggested that circulating bone marrow-derived ECs can be delivered to regions of injury to regenerate the endothelium ( Asahara et al . , 1999a; Asahara et al . , 1997; Asahara et al . , 1999b; Lin et al . , 2000; Takahashi et al . , 1999 ) , but this hypothesis has also proven controversial ( Purhonen et al . , 2008 ) . In the lung , it remained unclear whether all ECs , or only a unique subpopulation of progenitors , could contribute to endothelial injury repair . Our scRNA-seq analysis identifies a proliferating EC population that arises after acute lung injury and suggests that these cells are closely related to a subset of endogenous miECs . In addition , EdU incorporation analysis indicates that both Car4-high and other ECs proliferate across the 21 day period following injury , demonstrating that regenerative potential is not restricted to a particular subset of the endothelium . An increasingly useful mouse model to study alveolar destruction and regeneration has been the administration of a sub-lethal dose of the animalized version of the H1N1 influenza virus ( PR8 ) . This injury model has been used recently to show the death and regeneration of the alveolar epithelium , primarily by the expansion of a squamous Krt5+ epithelial cell ( Kumar et al . , 2011; Vaughan et al . , 2015 ) and an alveolar epithelial progenitor cell ( AEP ) ( Zacharias et al . , 2018 ) . This observed epithelial regeneration is necessary to cover the exposed basement membrane and increase the surface area available for gas exchange . To fully understand the regeneration of the alveolar compartment with respect to the recovery of gas exchange , the behavior of the capillary endothelium must be studied in parallel . While the epithelial cells have been observed as the primary infection site of the influenza virus resulting in their death both in vitro and in vivo ( Short et al . , 2014 ) , there is evidence that the endothelium can also be infected and killed in vitro ( Armstrong et al . , 2012 ) . However , the regeneration of the alveolar capillary plexus following influenza injury and the mechanisms by which gas exchange is re-established have remained incompletely understood . Our data sheds crucial light on the potential of the endothelium to proliferate after injury , a cellular behavior that likely serves to regenerate the pulmonary vasculature . High expression of Car4 in the EC population we have identified also suggests that these cells may play a specialized role in gas exchange in the mouse and that their proliferation after injury may contribute meaningfully to restoring the gas exchange interface in the lung: Car4 has been proposed to play a role in carbon dioxide exchange in the rat lung , where it is more broadly expressed in the microvasculature ( Fleming et al . , 1993 ) . A better understanding of the processes of endothelial proliferation and repair of the gas exchange interface will be a crucial step in developing therapies to alleviate patients of hypoxemia and acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) that can be developed post-influenza infection . An essential role of the endothelium in regeneration is to reestablish oxygenation of the tissue through restoration of blood circulation . The methods the endothelium uses to repopulate areas lacking in vascularity are classically defined as vasculogenesis , or formation of new vascular structures , and angiogenesis , or expansion of the vascular network through generation of new vessels from existing ones ( Potente and Mäkinen , 2017 ) . Of the cells that contribute to sprouting angiogenesis , there are two distinct EC phenotypes termed tip cells and stalk cells . Tip cells are leading cells that direct the new vessel growth through sprouting , invasion , and migration; stalk cells follow the tip cells and elongate , proliferate and establish the lumen of the new vessel ( Betz et al . , 2016; Potente et al . , 2011 ) . Tip cells are distinguished from stalk cells through increased expression of Vegfr2 and Nrp1 , which suppresses stalk cell fate ( Aspalter et al . , 2015; Simons et al . , 2016 ) , whereas stalk cells are characterized by expression of Notch1 and Vegfr1 , a decoy receptor that can sequester Vegf ( Blanco and Gerhardt , 2013 ) . However , tip cell and stalk cell fates are dynamic during sprouting angiogenesis , with ECs possessing the ability to respond to different environments by adjusting Vegfr levels ( Jakobsson et al . , 2010 ) . During late lung development and maturation , the lung vasculature is also thought to develop via intussusceptive angiogenesis , a poorly understood process of vessel splitting that may also contribute to regeneration in the lung ( Gianni-Barrera et al . , 2011 ) . Our transcriptomic analysis of the pulmonary endothelium through scRNA-seq shows that key tip cell genes such as Vegfr2 and Nrp1 are enriched in the Car4-high EC population at homeostasis and after injury; however , the Car4-high ECs also express high levels of stalk cell gene Vegfr1 ( Tables 1 , 2 and 4 ) . The Gpihbp1-high miEC population shares several reported transcripts that define stalk cells such as Hes1 , Hey1 and Jagged1 ( Moya et al . , 2012 ) . However , following influenza injury , the proliferating pulmonary EC population we have identified is closely transcriptionally associated with the miEC population , and endothelial proliferation is evident both in Car4-high and other ECs . This is in line with a recent report indicating that endothelial proliferation and regeneration in large vessels does not require the specification of tip or stalk cells , but is instead initially induced in all cells in close proximity to the site of injury ( McDonald et al . , 2018 ) . However , McDonald and colleagues report a second phase of regeneration in which a smaller subset of proliferating ECs in the aorta continue to generate new cells as wound healing progresses . The gene expression profiles of the cells we have identified and their pseudotime trajectories suggest that a similar phenomenon may occur in the microvasculature of the alveoli during regeneration after influenza injury , with a mechanism that does not require tip or stalk cell specification . Recently , the existence of ECs primed for proliferation in different vascular beds has gained appreciation ( Taha et al . , 2017 ) . Evidence for such cells in the lung has been derived from cell cloning assays that isolate a subset of cells that are prone to proliferate ( Alvarez et al . , 2008; Lee et al . , 2017 ) . Alvarez and colleagues showed that the clones derived from the microvascular endothelium that were prone to proliferate , termed resident microvascular endothelial progenitors , were enriched in expression of certain progenitor cell antigens ( e . g . , CD34 , CD309 ) ( Alvarez et al . , 2008 ) . Studies of these ECs in vitro have benefited from the ability to clonally assess the cells’ proliferative capacity , but in vitro EC studies are problematic because of the propensity of ECs to de-differentiate once put into culture ( Lacorre et al . , 2004 ) . Thus , studying such cell populations in vivo is essential to eliminate the confounding factors associated with cell culture studies . Evidence of proliferating ECs has been seen in models of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( Ebina et al . , 2004 ) , partial hepatectomy ( Ding et al . , 2010 ) , and left unilateral pneumonectomy ( Ding et al . , 2011 ) . Our studies suggest the presence of a Car4-high/Cd34-high EC subpopulation in the lung alveolus and the induction of a highly proliferative EC population after injury , but in contrast to previous studies , our data indicate that these two populations are not identical . Future work will further elucidate the relative contributions of Car4-high/Cd34-high ECs and other ECs to endothelial proliferation , the contributions of the proliferating endothelium to generation of new vasculature in the alveolar space after injury , and the roles of each cell type in re-establishing gas exchange and in other aspects of lung regeneration . 4 Materials and methods All mice were C57BL/6J females age 6–8 weeks old ( Jackson Laboratories , Bar Harbor , Maine; strain #000664 ) . All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Pennsylvania . Mice were housed in groups of up to five animals per cage when possible and supplied with extra enrichment if singly housed . Pharmaceutical grade bleomycin ( Hospira ) was non-surgically administered intratracheally to anesthetized mice at a concentration of 2 U/kg while control animals were instilled with PBS . Influenza infection was performed with the PR8-GP33 H1N1 influenza ( kindly gifted by Dr . John Wherry ) at a titrated dose of 0 . 3 LD50 or 1 LD50 diluted in PBS , in a 30 μL volume delivered intranasally . In our animals , these doses reult in a mild to moderate level of tissue damage with different zones of injury visible as previously reported ( Zacharias et al . , 2018 ) . Control animals were administered intranasal PBS . Recovery from infection was assessed after 7 , 14 , or 21 days as indicated , at which point tissue was harvested for histology or single cell isolation as described below . At the given time point of tissue analysis , mice were euthanized with a lethal dose of CO2 followed by cervical dislocation . Each mouse was then exsanguinated via the inferior vena cava . Upon opening the chest cavity , the lungs were further cleared of blood via perfusion of cold PBS through the right ventricle at a pressure of 40 cm of water . The trachea was then cannulated and the lungs inflation-fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde at a pressure of 30 cm of water , for 30 min at room temperature followed by 18 hr at 4°C . The lungs were dehydrated and paraffin embedded for microtome sectioning . Hematoxylin and eosin staining was utilized to assess morphology . Immunohistochemistry was used to recognize the antigens of various ECs , using the following antibodies: CD31 ( Rat , HistoBioTec DIA-310 ) , CD31 ( Rabbit , Thermo Fisher MA5-16337 ) , Vwf ( Rabbit , Dako A0082 ) , Vcam1 ( Rat , eBioscience 14–1061 ) , Gpihbp1 ( Rabbit , Thermo Fisher PA1-16976 ) , Plvap ( Rat , BioRad MCA2539T ) , CD34 ( Rat , PharMingen 553731 ) , Car4 ( Rat , R and D Systems MAB2414 ) , Ki67 ( Rabbit , Abcam ab16667 ) , phospho-histone H3 ( pHH3 , mouse , Cell Signaling Technologies 9706 ) , Sftpc ( Goat , Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-7706 ) , and Hopx ( Mouse , Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-398703 ) . Lung tissue was prepared as described for histology and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4°C . RNAscope ( Advanced Cell Diagnostics ) was performed using the Fluorescent Multiplex Reagent Kit v2 ( ACD 323100 ) according to the manufacturer’s protocol . The following probes were used in this analysis: mm-Vegfc ( ACD 492701 ) , mm-Cxcl12 ( ACD 422711 ) , mm-Car4-C3 ( ACD 468421-C3 ) , mm-Prc1-C3 ( ACD 577121-C3 ) , mm-Top2a ( ACD 491221 ) , mm-Gpihbp1-C3 ( ACD 540631-C3 ) , mm-Plvap ( ACD 440221 ) , mm-Pecam1-C2 ( ACD 316721-C2 ) , mm-Sftpc ( ACD 314101 ) , and mm-Hopx ( ACD 405161 ) . Following the dissection and washing procedure outlined above , unless otherwise stated , all lobes were dissected from the main-stem bronchus and vasculature . All lobes were then minced with a razor blade , and digested in a mixture of collagenase-I , dispase and DNase as previously described ( Zepp et al . , 2017 ) . Following trituration and filtration , red blood cells were lysed , and single cells were resuspended in a FACS buffer containing 1% FBS and 1 mM EDTA . The following antibodies were used for flow cytometry or sorting: CD45-PE-Cy7 ( Thermo Fisher 25-0451-82 ) , CD45-APC ( Thermo Fisher 17-0451-83 ) , CD45-PerCP-Cy5 . 5 ( Thermo Fisher 45-0451-82 ) , CD31-PE ( Thermo Fisher 12-0311-83 ) , CD31-PE-Cy7 ( Thermo Fisher 25-0311-82 ) , CD31-APC ( Thermo Fisher 17-0311-82 ) , and CD34-eF450 ( Thermo Fisher 48-0341-80 ) . For proliferation analysis , cells that had incorporated EdU were fluorescently labeled using the Click-iT Plus EdU Cell Proliferation Kit ( Thermo Fisher ) . To isolate ECs for scRNA-seq , single-cell suspensions were first gated to include small cells , gated on singlets , and gated to eliminate dead cells ( DAPI negative cells ) . From the CD45-negative population , the expression of CD31 was analyzed and cell sorting was performed with the MoFlo Astrios Eq ( Beckman Coulter ) . To isolate CD34-high and CD34-low ECs for gene expression analysis , single-cell suspensions were first gated to include small cells , gated on singlets , and gated to isolate CD45-negative cells . From the CD45-negative population , the expression of CD31 and CD34 were analyzed and cell sorting was performed with the FACSAria Fusion Sorter ( BD Biosciences ) . Cells were sorted directly from the cytometer into TRIzol-LS ( Thermo Fisher ) and RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer’s protocol . cDNA was generated using the Superscript IV First-Strand Synthesis System ( Thermo Fisher ) . qRT-PCR was performed using Power SYBR Green 2x Master Mix ( Thermo Fisher ) on a QuantStudio 7 Flex system ( Applied Biosystems ) . Data was analyzed using a standard curve method , and all calculations were performed using the Pfaffl method to incorporate primer efficiencies calculated from standard curves . Primer sequences are listed in Table 5 . All experiments used C57BL/6J female mice aged 6–8 weeks old . For the endothelial-specific scRNA-seq analysis , single cell suspension was prepared from N = 3 individual animals as described above . DAPI-negative , CD45-negative and CD31-positive cells were sorted to obtain heterogeneous pulmonary endothelium . For the whole-lung scRNA-seq analysis , DAPI-negative , CD45-negative cells were sorted to obtain all non-immune lung cells from N = 1 control animal and N = 2 influenza-injured animals . The cell suspension was loaded onto a GemCode instrument ( 10X Genomics ) as previously described ( Zepp et al . , 2017 ) . Briefly , single-cell barcoded droplets were produced using 10X Single Cell 3’ v2 chemistry . Libraries generated were sequenced using the HiSeq Rapid SBS kit . For the heterogeneous pulmonary endothelium samples , the resulting libraries were sequenced across two lanes of an Illumina HiSeq2500 instrument in High-output mode . For the whole lung samples , the resulting libraries were sequenced across a single lane of an Illumina HiSeq2500 instrument in Rapid Run mode . Reads were aligned and gene level unique molecular identifier ( UMI ) counts were obtained using the Cell Ranger pipeline . t-SNE plots for individual heterogeneous pulmonary endothelial samples were generated from the Cell Ranger pipline . Data from individual animals was aggregated for further analyses , which were performed using the Seurat v2 . 0 pipeline ( Butler et al . , 2018 ) . Briefly , the R package Seurat ( version 2 . 3 . 4 , http://satijalab . org/seurat/ ) was used to perform scRNA-seq analysis . Cells were first filtered to have >500 detected genes and less than 5% of total UMIs mapping to the mitochondrial genome . Cell cycle phase score was calculated for each cell using the Seurat function CellCycleScoring . Data was scaled to remove unwanted variation from number of genes , percent mitochondrial , cell cycle score reduced by regression . Principal component analysis ( PCA ) was used to reduce the dataset into a smaller number of components ( eigengenes ) while preserving the variation of the entire data set . The number of dimensions used in cluster analysis and dimension reduction procedures was determined using the JackStraw test . Dimension reduction was performed using the uniform manifold approximation protection ( UMAP ) method ( Becht et al . , 2018 ) . Biological replicates were aggregated using the Canonical Correlation Analysis ( CCA ) method implemented in Seurat . Seurat was used to create dimension reduction and violin plots . Circos plots and Gene Ontology comparison heatmaps were generated with Metascape ( Tripathi et al . , 2015 ) . All data is available on the gene expression omnibus ( GEO ) accession GEO:GSE128944 . Ligand-receptor gene pairs were obtained from the FANTOM5 project ( http://fantom . gsc . riken . jp/5/suppl/Ramilowski_et_al_2015/ ) . For a given cluster , a ligand or receptor was considered expressed if 30% of cells had a UMI value of greater than 0 . A directed graph was constructed with the nodes as clusters and edges as number of ligand-receptor pairs between each cluster . R package igraph was used to make the network plots . Cells were embedded to low dimensional space using the UMAP technique ( Becht et al . , 2018 ) . UMAP was chosen for its ability to preserve global structure of the original data set . A cluster-based minimum spanning tree ( MST ) was performed using the getLineages function in the R package Slingshot ( Street et al . , 2018 ) . Developmental curves along these linages were created using the getCurves function . Plots were created using the R ggplot2 package . Automated quantification of proliferating cells was performed from large single-optical-plane confocal tile scan images containing tens of thousands of total cells . Machine learning was implemented using ilastik software ( Berg et al . , 2019 ) for supervised pixel classification to distinguish IHC signal from noise as well as to segment closely associated nuclei . Subsequent object detection and quantification was performed using CellProfiler 3 . 0 ( McQuin et al . , 2018 ) . Statistical analysis of scRNA-seq data was performed in R . Statistical analysis of qRT-PCR , flow cytometry , and cell counting data was performed using GraphPad Prism software . To determine if differences between experimental groups were statistically significant , a one-way ANOVA was performed , followed by Holm-Sidak multiple comparison tests . A Brown-Forsythe test was used to assess differences in standard deviation between groups . If variances were significantly different , a nonparametric Kruskal-Wallace test was used in place of ANOVA to determine if differences between groups were statistically significant , followed by Dunn’s multiple comparison tests . Graphs are displayed as box-and-whisker plots or as bar plots indicating mean and standard deviation . In all cases , each individual data point is displayed on the graph . Values for N as well as p values are indicated in figure legends ."}
{"doi": "elife-46418-v2", "abstract": "Sexual interactions have a potent influence on health in several species , including mammals . Previous work in C . elegans identified strategies used by males to accelerate the demise of the opposite sex ( hermaphrodites ) . But whether hermaphrodites evolved counter-strategies against males remains unknown . Here we discover that young C . elegans hermaphrodites are remarkably resistant to brief sexual encounters with males , whereas older hermaphrodites succumb prematurely . Surprisingly , it is not their youthfulness that protects young hermaphrodites , but the fact that they have self-sperm . The beneficial effect of self-sperm is mediated by a sperm-sensing pathway acting on the soma rather than by fertilization . Activation of this pathway in females triggers protection from the negative impact of males . Interestingly , the role of self-sperm in protecting against the detrimental effects of males evolved independently in hermaphroditic nematodes . Endogenous strategies to delay the negative effect of mating may represent a key evolutionary innovation to maximize reproductive success .", "plain language summary": "A nematode worm known as Caenorhabditis elegans is often used in the laboratory to study how animals grow and develop . There are two types of C . elegans worm: hermaphrodite individuals produce both female sex cells ( eggs ) and male sex cells ( sperm ) , while male individuals only produce sperm . The hermaphrodite worms are able to reproduce without mating with another worm , allowing populations of C . elegans to grow rapidly when they are living in favorable conditions . However , when the hermaphrodites do mate with males they tend to produce more offspring . These offspring are also usually healthier because they receive a mixture of genetic material from two different parents . Although mating is beneficial for the survival of a species it can also harm an individual animal . Previous studies have shown that mating with male worms can accelerate aging of hermaphrodite worms and cause premature death . However , it remained unclear whether hermaphrodite worms have evolved any mechanisms to protect themselves after mating with a male . To address this question , Booth et al . used genetic techniques to study the lifespans of hermaphrodite worms . The experiments found that the hermaphrodites’ own sperm ( known as self-sperm ) regulated a sperm-sensing signaling pathway that protected them from the negative impact of mating with males . Hermaphrodites with self-sperm that mated with males lived for a similar length of time as hermaphrodites that did not mate . On the other hand , hermaphrodites that did not have self-sperm ( because they were older or had a genetic mutation ) had shorter lifespans after mating than worms that did not mate . Modulating the sperm-sensing signaling pathway in worms that lacked self-sperm was sufficient to protect them from the negative effects of mating with males . Further experiments found that the hermaphrodites of another nematode worm called C . briggsae – which evolved self-sperm independently of C . elegans – also protected themselves from the negative effects of mating with males in a similar way . This suggests that other animals may also have evolved similar mechanisms to protect themselves from harm when mating . A separate study by Shi et al . has found that the beneficial effects of self-sperm are mediated by a pathway linked to longevity that also exists in mammals . The results of both investigations combined suggest possible avenues for future research into the complex relationship between health , longevity , and reproduction .", "article": "1 Introduction Animals interact with each other in complex ways that can affect their health , including sexual , cooperative , and competitive interactions . Sexual interactions drastically impact an individual’s health and behavior . In Drosophila and C . elegans , sexual interactions are detrimental to health and shorten the lifespan of both sexes ( Aprison and Ruvinsky , 2016; Chapman et al . , 1995; Fowler and Partridge , 1989; Gems and Riddle , 1996; Gendron et al . , 2014; Harvanek et al . , 2017; Maures et al . , 2014; Partridge and Farquhar , 1981; Promislow , 2003; Promislow , 1992; Shi and Murphy , 2014; Shi et al . , 2017; Ting et al . , 2014; Van Voorhies , 1992; Woodruff et al . , 2014; Wu et al . , 2012 ) . In mammals , mates induce neurological , developmental , and behavioral changes in the opposite sex and can negatively impact health ( Gao et al . , 2017; Garratt et al . , 2016; Aloise King et al . , 2013; Stowers and Kuo , 2015 ) . For example , the presence of males can increase female body weight ( Garratt et al . , 2016 ) and accelerate puberty ( Flanagan et al . , 2011; Vandenbergh , 1969 ) . Identification of specific strategies involved in responding to the effects of sexual encounters could help to improve our understanding of how the sexes interact with each other , how sexual pressures have shaped species over evolutionary time , and how these mechanisms could be harnessed to improve health . C . elegans is particularly well suited to the study of the effect of sexual interactions on lifespan . Males shorten the lifespan of the C . elegans hermaphrodite through a phenomenon called male-induced demise ( Gems and Riddle , 1996; Maures et al . , 2014; Shi and Murphy , 2014 ) . Previous studies showed that males shorten hermaphrodite lifespan by several means ( e . g . sperm , seminal fluid , and pheromones ) , and identified some of the hermaphrodite genes that mediate male-induced demise ( e . g . utx-1 , ins-11 , daf-16 ) ( Maures et al . , 2014; Shi and Murphy , 2014 ) . However , whether hermaphrodites evolved natural defense mechanisms to protect themselves after a sexual encounter with a male remained unknown . Here we discover that young hermaphrodites are entirely protected from brief sexual encounters with males . Surprisingly , the natural protection in young hermaphrodites is not due to their youthfulness , but rather to the presence of self-sperm . Self-sperm act through a sperm-sensing pathway to protect the soma in a fertilization-independent manner , and activating this pathway in females can protect them against the detrimental effect of males . The protective effect of self-sperm is conserved in other hermaphroditic nematodes and may represent a key adaptation for their reproductive success . 2 Results Previous studies were done with long encounters between young C . elegans hermaphrodites and males ( Gems and Riddle , 1996; Maures et al . , 2014; Shi and Murphy , 2014 ) , which does not reflect the situation in nature where males are rare ( Barrière and Félix , 2005 ) . We thus asked if varying the length of sexual interactions , as well as the age of males and hermaphrodites , could reveal natural strategies that evolved to mitigate the negative impact of sexual encounters on health ( Figure 1A ) . As previously shown ( Gems and Riddle , 1996; Maures et al . , 2014; Shi and Murphy , 2014 ) , long and frequent sexual interactions with young males shortened hermaphrodite lifespan ( Figure 1B and Figure 1—figure supplement 1A ) . Middle-aged males were less able to induce premature demise of the opposite sex than young males ( Figure 1B ) , probably because of their decreased ability to efficiently mate ( Guo et al . , 2012 ) ( Supplementary file 3 ) . To better mimic the natural situation—where sexual interactions are infrequent due to the rarity of males—and isolate the mating-specific aspect of sexual interactions , we tested how a brief ( two-hour ) mating with young males impacts young and middle-aged hermaphrodites ( Figure 1C , D ) . Because the chance of a sexual interaction is relatively low in the brief two-hour exposure and can differ depending on the age of the hermaphrodite ( Supplementary file 3; Garcia et al . , 2007; Leighton et al . , 2014 ) , we specifically measured the lifespans of hermaphrodites that mated using a fluorescent sperm tracking method to isolate hermaphrodites that received male sperm ( Figure 1E and Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–F ) ( Stanfield and Villeneuve , 2006 ) . Interestingly , while a brief encounter with males induced the premature death of middle-aged hermaphrodites , it did not affect the lifespan of young hermaphrodites ( Figure 1C , D , F and G ) . Young hermaphrodites were remarkably resistant to the negative impact of males , even though they successfully mated ( Figure 1C , F ) . We confirmed this observation using two different male strains and two methods of isolating mated hermaphrodites ( Figure 1C , D , F and G ) . Thus , shortening the length of sexual interactions , which is more similar to the situation in nature , reveals that young hermaphrodites can defend themselves against the lifespan-shortening effect of mating with males . Young and middle-aged hermaphrodites differ not only by their ages , but also in their reproductive status . Young hermaphrodites are self-fertile , due to the presence of both oocytes and self-sperm . In contrast , middle-aged hermaphrodites are no longer self-fertile , because they have exhausted their self-sperm , though they can still reproduce if their oocytes are fertilized by males ( Riddle et al . , 1997 ) . To disentangle age and reproductive status , we compared the lifespan of young hermaphrodites to that of young ‘feminized’ individuals ( which have oocytes , but no self-sperm; Ellis and Schedl , 2007 ) after a brief encounter with males . Surprisingly , young feminized individuals ( fem-1[hc17] or fog-2[q71]; Doniach and Hodgkin , 1984; Schedl and Kimble , 1988 ) were sensitive to mating-induced death and exhibited premature death and deterioration ( Figure 2A–D and Figure 2—figure supplement 1A , B ) . Although mating efficiency can vary between C . elegans mutants and individuals of different ages ( Supplementary file 3; Garcia et al . , 2007; Leighton et al . , 2014; Morsci et al . , 2011 ) , we specifically measured the lifespan of only the hermaphrodites that mated ( i . e . received male sperm ) ( Figure 1E ) . Thus , mating efficiency differences are unlikely to contribute to the sensitivity of feminized individuals to males . Consistent with the observation that the presence of self-sperm is necessary to live a normal lifespan even after a brief encounter with males , young individuals that lack self-sperm and oocytes ( glp-1[e2144]; Priess et al . , 1987 ) also lived shorter after a brief encounter with males ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1C , D ) , even though glp-1 mutants are normally long-lived ( Antebi , 2013; Arantes-Oliveira et al . , 2002; Hansen et al . , 2013; Keith and Ghazi , 2015; Wang et al . , 2008 ) . Together , these results indicate that a major factor in protecting an individual from the detrimental influence of males is not youthfulness , but the presence of self-sperm . To further investigate the importance of self-sperm in the resistance of young hermaphrodites to the negative impact of mating with males , we performed RNA-seq on young or middle-aged hermaphrodites or feminized individuals that were never exposed to males ( no males ) or had a brief encounter with males ( +male sperm ) ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2A ) . Principal Component Analysis ( PCA ) revealed that , as expected ( Angeles-Albores et al . , 2017 ) , the transcriptomes of hermaphrodites and feminized individuals that were never exposed to males separated based on fertility status and , to some extent , age ( Figure 2E , F and Figure 2—figure supplement 2B ) . Interestingly , the first principal component separated the transcriptomes of hermaphrodites that have a shortened lifespan ( middle-aged upon mating ) from those of hermaphrodites that live a normal lifespan ( young upon mating , young and middle-aged without mating ) ( Figure 2E ) . Consistently , the first principal component also separated the transcriptomes of feminized individuals that have a shortened lifespan ( young and middle-aged upon mating ) from those of feminized individuals that live a normal lifespan ( young and middle-aged without mating ) ( Figure 2F ) . This observation confirms the importance of self-sperm in the protection from males . GO terms linked with individuals that are resistant ( e . g . young hermaphrodites ) or sensitive to mating-induced death ( e . g . young feminized ) included translation , lipid metabolism , the innate immune response , and protein homeostasis ( proteostasis ) ( Figure 2G–I , Figure 2—figure supplement 2C , and Figure 2—source data 1 and 2 ) , suggesting these conserved homeostatic pathways could be responsible for the lifespan differences in the response to males . Indeed , many of these pathways are linked with longevity ( Kaeberlein et al . , 2015; Kenyon , 2010; López-Otín et al . , 2013; Riera et al . , 2016; Shore and Ruvkun , 2013 ) . Collectively , these data indicate that the presence of self-sperm is necessary to protect the soma against deterioration due to brief encounters with males , perhaps by regulating homeostasis pathways . Self-sperm play a key role in germline quality assurance in C . elegans by triggering the clearance of carbonylated and aggregated proteins from the germline ( Bohnert and Kenyon , 2017; Goudeau and Aguilaniu , 2010 ) . However , whether self-sperm could harness this potential to protect the soma is not known . To determine if the presence of self-sperm is sufficient to protect hermaphrodites , we examined the response of individuals with a masculinized germline ( which have a female soma and self-sperm , but no oocytes ) , fem-3 ( q20 ) ( Ahringer and Kimble , 1991; Barton et al . , 1987; Ellis and Schedl , 2007 ) . Masculinized individuals that only have self-sperm were protected from premature death induced by mating with males not only when young , but even at an older age when hermaphrodites normally become sensitive to an encounter with males ( Figure 3A–D , and Figure 3—figure supplement 1A , B ) . These data suggest that the presence of self-sperm is sufficient to protect from the detrimental effects on lifespan of a brief mating with males . We next asked whether self-sperm could act via their ability to self-fertilize hermaphrodites . Interestingly , hermaphrodite mutants that are defective in self-fertilization despite maintaining self-sperm ( spe-9[hc88]; Ellis and Stanfield , 2014b; Singson et al . , 1998 ) were still protected from early death induced by mating with males when young ( Figure 3E , F ) . In contrast , hermaphrodites that are defective in self-sperm maturation ( due to loss of the SPE-44 transcription factor; Kasimatis et al . , 2018; Kulkarni et al . , 2012 ) were no longer protected from the lifespan shortening effects of mating with males when young ( Figure 3G and Figure 3—figure supplement 1C , D ) . Thus , the presence of mature self-sperm , but not self-fertilization , is sufficient for the protection against mating-induced demise . We next explored the mechanisms by which self-sperm protect individuals . Self-sperm could protect individuals independently of fertilization , by acting via sperm-sensing pathways . In C . elegans , sperm proteins are known to be sensed by the somatic gonad and to signal to the germline and somatic gonad by repressing the homeodomain transcription factor CEH-18 and the Ephrin receptor VAB-1 ( Figure 4A and Greenstein et al . , 1994; Miller , 2001; Miller , 2003 ) . Hence , the loss of CEH-18 and VAB-1 can mimic the presence of self-sperm ( Miller , 2003 ) . Deficiency in CEH-18 and VAB-1 was sufficient to protect middle-aged hermaphrodites that have depleted their self-sperm from the negative effects of mating with males ( Figure 4D , E ) . Interestingly , deficiency in CEH-18 and VAB-1 in young feminized individuals made them resistant to brief encounter with males ( Figure 4B , C ) , indicating that this conserved pathway could be sufficient to protect females against the negative impact of males . To understand how this pathway might work to protect the soma , we examined the potential links between the transcription factor CEH-18 and the genes differentially expressed between hermaphrodites and feminized individuals that we identified by RNA-seq . ceh-18 mRNA levels were not significantly affected by the presence of self-sperm or mating with a male ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1A ) . In contrast , several genes that interact genetically or physically with CEH-18 , including the chromatin modifiers set-33 and jmjd-3 . 2 , were differentially expressed between young hermaphrodites and feminized individuals that have successfully mated with males ( Figure 4F and Figure 4—figure supplement 1B ) . These observations suggest that differences in chromatin state between young hermaphrodites and feminized individuals may contribute to the transcriptional effect of the CEH-18 sperm-sensing transcription factor in the resistance and sensitivity to mating-induced death . A subset of the genes regulated by the presence of self-sperm or mating with a male contained a CEH-18 binding site in their regulatory regions ( Figure 4—source data 1 ) , though the CEH-18 motif and binding peaks ( Kudron et al . , 2018; Narasimhan et al . , 2015 ) were not significantly enriched in these genes ( perhaps due to cell heterogeneity ( Cao et al . , 2017 ) , see Material and methods ) . We asked if the subset of genes that are differentially expressed between young hermaphrodites and young feminized individuals and contain a CEH-18 binding site were enriched for specific biological features ( Figure 4—source data 1 and 2 ) . Interestingly , GO term enrichment of these genes revealed several terms linked with longevity , including ‘Determination of adult lifespan’ ( Figure 4G , Figure 4—figure supplement 1C ) , suggesting that the sperm-sensing transcription factor CEH-18 may directly regulate genes that affect longevity . Together , these results show that self-sperm protect individuals , even older ones , from mating-induced death by repressing a sperm-sensing pathway in the somatic gonad , which could in turn protect hermaphrodites by altering chromatin and transcriptional networks . Is the ability of self-sperm to promote resistance to brief interactions with males unique to C . elegans or a common hermaphroditic strategy for resistance to the negative impact of mating with males to optimize their reproduction and health ? The C . elegans ancestor was a gonochoric species with true females and obligatory males ( Kiontke et al . , 2004 ) . Hermaphroditism evolved at least three times independently in this lineage ( in C . elegans , C . briggsae , and C . tropicalis ) ( Ellis and Lin , 2014a; Guo et al . , 2009; Hill et al . , 2006; Kiontke et al . , 2004; Kiontke et al . , 2011; Nayak et al . , 2005; Thomas et al . , 2012 ) ( Figure 5A ) . Other nematode species remained true females ( e . g . C . remanei and C . brenneri ) ( Figure 5A ) . Both hermaphroditic and true female nematodes are known to succumb prematurely following long interactions with males ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1A , B and Maures et al . , 2014; Palopoli et al . , 2015; Shi and Murphy , 2014 ) , but the effect of brief interactions has not been tested . We found that C . remanei and C . brenneri females lived normal lifespans following brief , two-hour interactions with males at all of the ages we tested ( Figure 5B and Figure 5—figure supplement 1B ) , suggesting that the differential sensitivity of old versus young hermaphrodites may have evolved in hermaphroditic species . Indeed , we found that young C . briggsae hermaphrodites ( which have self-sperm ) resisted a brief exposure to males and lived a normal lifespan whereas middle-aged C . briggsae hermaphrodites ( which have depleted their self-sperm ) succumbed to brief encounter with males ( Figure 5C and Figure 5—figure supplement 1C ) . Interestingly , feminized individuals in C . briggsae ( due to a different mutation than C . elegans , the she-1 feminizing mutation , which affects sex determination; Guo et al . , 2009 ) , also became sensitive to a brief interaction with males when young and exhibited premature death ( Figure 5D ) . As with C . elegans , we controlled for age- and genotype-dependent differences in C . briggsae mating efficiency ( Supplementary file 3 ) using fluorescent male sperm tracking ( Figure 1E ) . Does the sperm-sensing pathway mediate self-sperm protection from mating-induced demise in C . briggsae as it does in C . elegans hermaphrodites ? We first verified that knock-down of the orthologous sperm-sensing pathway in C . briggsae females ( mfIs42[Cel-sid-2; Cel-myo-2::DsRed]; she-1[v35] ) indeed reduced the accumulation of unfertilized oocytes in the gonad arms and increased the number of unfertilized oocytes in the uterus ( Figure 5—figure supplement 3 ) similar to C . elegans ( Miller , 2003 ) . Interestingly , knock-down of the C . briggsae sperm-sensing genes protected middle-aged hermaphrodites ( which are self-sperm depleted ) from the lifespan shortening effects of a brief interaction with males ( Figure 5E , F ) . Together , these results suggest that hermaphroditism , notably the presence of self-sperm and detection by the sperm-sensing pathway , may have co-evolved more than once with strategies to protect from the detrimental effect of sexual interactions with the opposite sex . This may be particularly important to allow hermaphrodites to maximize their reproductive success by fertilizing their eggs through self-fertilization and mating with another male later in life . As male sperm out-compete hermaphroditic self-sperm ( LaMunyon and Samuel , 1999; Ward and Carrel , 1979 ) , such a strategy would also allow for the hermaphroditic self-sperm to be used . Because the sperm-sensing pathway is conserved in species with true females and is sufficient to protect feminized individuals , this pathway could be leveraged to protect the soma in a conserved manner , even in other species . 3 Discussion Here we show that a sensing mechanism between the germline and the soma mediates protection against the negative impact of sexual interactions . While previous work revealed the phenomenon of male-induced demise and identified specific mutations that could protect individuals from male-induced demise ( Gems and Riddle , 1996; Maures et al . , 2014; Shi and Murphy , 2014 ) , it was unknown whether natural defenses exist to protect from the detrimental effects of males and what their mechanism of action could be . The previous studies investigated the effects of prolonged interactions between the sexes . While there is evidence of occasional ‘bursts’ of high rates of males in wild C . elegans populations ( Barrière and Félix , 2005; Frézal and Félix , 2015; Sivasundar and Hey , 2005 ) , males in the wild are thought to be rare . Thus , sexual interactions in nature are likely to be quite brief . Here , we have used very brief interactions between the sexes to uncover phenomena that better reflect the natural situation . We show for the first time that innate mechanisms that involve self-sperm can protect against the deleterious effects of mating with males . The presence of self-sperm in hermaphrodites is also known to decrease attraction of and mating with males ( Garcia et al . , 2007; Leighton et al . , 2014; Morsci et al . , 2011; Shi and Murphy , 2014 ) , and we did account for this in our study by selecting only mated individuals . Hence , self-sperm may be evolutionary important to ensure , in several different ways , that hermaphrodites produce as many of their own self-progeny as possible before succumbing to mating-induced death . Whether the ability of males to shorten the lifespan of older hermaphrodites that lack self-sperm is advantageous in nature remains unknown . The number of animals that reach middle or older-age in the wild is probably low . However , the protective effect of self-sperm on the soma appears to have evolved independently in two distantly-related species , suggesting that it is important for nematode hermaphrodites . The role of self-sperm as a signal to regulate the response to the opposite sex may also have evolved in other animals , including self-fertilizing hermaphroditic species ( e . g . snails , slugs , and the vertebrate mangrove killifish ) ( Jarne and Auld , 2006; Mackiewicz et al . , 2006 ) . The ancestor of C . elegans and related nematodes did not have self-sperm-mediated protection from mating-induced death and our data indicate that self-sperm mediated protection was an evolutionary innovation in the C . elegans and C . briggsae lineages . Whether the evolution of resistance to mating-induced death in C . elegans and C . briggsae occurred as the result of linking ancestral protection mechanisms to self-sperm , or whether novel mechanisms evolved in these hermaphroditic lineages , is unknown . However , given that self-sperm mediated mating-induced death protection evolved more than once in Caenorhabditis nematodes , the most parsimonious model is that the hermaphroditic lineages linked ancestral protection mechanisms with self-sperm . Indeed , the signaling pathways that are engaged by self-sperm ( an Ephrin receptor and homeodomain transcription factor ) are conserved in nematodes , suggesting that these ancestral pathways were harnessed in unique ways in the hermaphroditic lineages to evolve self-sperm mediated resistance to mating-induced death . This raises the intriguing possibility that such protective mechanisms could also be ‘tuned up’ in female species by mimicking activation of the signaling pathways that are triggered by self-sperm . Interestingly , the Ephrin receptor that detects the presence of sperm is conserved in mammals , it is expressed in the somatic gonad ( Figure 5—figure supplement 2B; Uhlén et al . , 2015 ) , and is linked with mammalian fertility ( Barban et al . , 2016; Buensuceso et al . , 2016 ) . Thus , some of the mechanisms that signal between germline and soma could be used more generally to protect against the negative impact of sexual interactions in other species . Fertilization has a rejuvenating effect in the germline and resets the aging clock in each generation ( Rando and Chang , 2012; Unal et al . , 2011 ) . Consistently , self-sperm can clear carbonylated and aggregated proteins , two aging hallmarks , in the germline of C . elegans ( Bohnert and Kenyon , 2017; Goudeau and Aguilaniu , 2010 ) . Resetting of aging features can be achieved to some degree in mammalian somatic cells by the process of reprogramming to induced pluripotent stem cells , which can mimic fertilization and has a ‘rejuvenating’ capacity ( Rando and Chang , 2012 ) . In mammals , triggering rejuvenating factors in somatic cells , in a manner that is uncoupled from de-differentiation , has been recently suggested to be a potential rejuvenation strategy ( Ocampo et al . , 2016 ) . However , the potential role of sperm in protection , and possible rejuvenation , of the soma is not known . Given the effect of sperm and fertilization on resetting the aging clock in the germline , as well as the conservation of key elements of the sensing pathway , it is possible that the protective properties of self-sperm , or even sperm itself , are conserved in other species , including mammals . These findings could open new strategies for harnessing the potential of gametes and their sensing pathways to ‘reset’ some hallmarks of aging . 4 Materials and methods All C . elegans , C . briggsae , C . remanei , and C . brenneri WT and mutant strains used in this study are listed in Supplementary file 1 . All strains were maintained on Nematode Growth Media ( NGM ) plates with 50 μg/mL streptomycin ( Gibco ) and a lawn of OP50-1 bacteria ( a gift from M . -W . Tan ) from stationary phase cultures . Nematodes were grown at 20°C , with the exception of temperature-sensitive mutants ( glp-1[e2144] , fem-1[hc17] , fem-3[q20] , and spe-9[hc88] ) , which were maintained at 15°C ( permissive temperature ) . When temperature sensitive mutants were used for assays , they were grown at the restrictive temperature ( 25°C ) . The genotype of strains was verified by genotyping PCR and Sanger sequencing and the strains were backcrossed three times into our laboratory’s N2 strain ( in addition to the backcrossing that was performed when the mutants were initially isolated ) . Because some C . elegans strains have been recently reported to inadvertently contain a long-lived allele of the fln-2 gene ( personal communication , Y . Zhao , H . Wang , R . J . Poole and D . Gems [the Worm Breeder’s Gazette , 2018] ) , we verified the fln-2 genotype using genotyping by PCR followed by Sanger sequencing using the following primers ( 5'-GGGTGAAGAATGAGAAACACGC and 5'-ATGATGCAGTTTTGCCAACGG ) . The forward primer ( listed first ) was used for sequencing . We confirmed that the key strains used in this study—N2 ( WT ) , BA17 ( fem-1[hc17] ) , CB4108 ( fog-2[q71] ) , CF1903 ( glp-1[e2144] ) , JK816 ( fem-3[q20] ) , DG1604 ( fog-2[q71]; ceh-18[mg57] ) , and GR1034 ( ceh-18[mg57] ) —did not contain this long-lived allele of fln-2 and were wild-type for this allele . C . elegans , C . brenneri , C . remanei , and C . briggsae lifespan assays were performed in the same manner . Hermaphrodites or females for these assays were age-synchronized with a short ( 3–4 hr ) egg-lay using young ( day 3–5 of life ) , well-fed adult parents . For the female species ( C . brenneri and C . remanei ) , age-synchronized , virgin females were identified and isolated from males by placing them on fresh plates at the L4 stage . All worms were grown on NGM plates with streptomycin ( 50 μg/mL ) and seeded with OP50-1 bacteria unless RNAi knock-down was performed . In the case of RNAi knock-down , worms were cultured on NGM containing ampicillin ( 100 μg/mL , Sigma ) and IPTG ( 0 . 4 mM , Invitrogen ) . During development , worms were fed HT115 bacteria ( grown to stationary phase , RNAi expression induced for 2–4 hr with 0 . 4 mM IPTG , and the bacteria concentrated to 20x ) carrying empty vector ( EV ) . Upon adulthood ( day 3 of life ) , HT115 bacteria ( grown to stationary phase , RNAi expression induced for 2–4 hr with 0 . 4 mM IPTG , and the bacteria concentrated to 20x ) carrying the appropriate RNAi clone from the Ahringer RNAi library ( Kamath et al . , 2003 ) ( a gift from A . Fire ) or RNAi clones created in this study ( see ‘C . briggsae RNAi knock-down’ ) . The inserts of the plasmids encoding the RNAi clones used in this study were sequenced to verify their identity . For each assay , worms were scored as dead or alive and transferred to new plates daily during the reproductive period and then every other day . Worms were scored as dead if they did not respond to gentle , repeated prodding with a wire pick ( 90% Pt , 10% Ir ) along different points of their body . Worms were scored as censored if they crawled off the media or died due to bagging ( internal hatching ) or vulval rupture . Data from these censored worms were included up until the point of censorship ( see Supplementary file 2 for all data ) . For conditions in which the effect of sexual interactions was assessed , we used one of three methods , as indicated . For the long-term exposure method ( described in Maures et al . , 2014; Shi and Murphy , 2014 ) , young males ( day 1 to 2 of adulthood ) were added to the hermaphrodites at the onset of adulthood . For lifespan experiments in which the hermaphrodites were exposed to males for their entire adulthood ( Maures et al . , 2014 ) , males were added in a 1:1 ratio with hermaphrodites and the number of males remained fixed , even as hermaphrodites began to die or censored . Male worms were replaced every other day at the time the hermaphrodites were transferred to new plates . Male stocks were set up every day for the entirety of the lifespan assay . For the lifespan experiments in which hermaphrodites were exposed to males for only one day ( Shi and Murphy , 2014 ) , young males were added in a 2:1 male:hermaphrodite ratio . Following 24 hr of exposure , hermaphrodites were moved to new plates and did not encounter a male again throughout their lifespan . For the newly established , short mating-induced demise lifespan experiments , the males and hermaphrodites were only allowed to interact for 2 hr at the age specified for each assay . Males were twice as abundant as hermaphrodites during the mating period . Following a mating period of two hours , mating was assessed by the presence of fluorescent male sperm ( see below ) . These mated hermaphrodites did not interact with an adult male again and worms on plates in which male progeny reached adulthood and could have mated with the hermaphrodites were censored . Synchronized individuals ( hermaphrodites , feminized individuals etc . ) were randomly assigned to the ‘no males’ or ‘+males’ conditions by picking them onto fresh plates in an alternating manner to avoid selection bias . Similarly , the males used for mating with individuals of different genotypes or ages were from the same sets of males and were allocated randomly in an alternating manner . For each single biological replicate , approximately 35 individuals were placed on each of 2–4 plates ( each plate represents a technical replicate ) . The number of individuals per plate and number of technical replicates were chosen based on field standards ( Lucanic et al . , 2017 ) . For feminized and sterile mutants , slight modifications were made to the methods . The sterile glp-1 ( e2144 ) mutant , fertilization defective spe-9 ( hc88 ) mutant , masculinized fem-3 ( q20 ) mutant , and WT control parents were used for an egg lay at the permissive temperature ( 15°C ) and following the egg lay , the individuals used for the assay were kept at 25°C for the remainder of the assay . The feminized fem-1 ( hc17 ) mutants and the WT control parents were kept at 15°C for the egg lay and these eggs developed until day 3 of life ( adulthood ) at 25°C ( the restrictive temperature ) . Then , both the fem-1 ( hc17 ) feminized worms and the WT worms were moved to 20°C for the remainder of the assay . The lower temperature did not impact the feminized phenotype . For the auxin-inducible degradation of the transcription factor SPE-44 , the worms were grown on NGM with 1 mM auxin ( 3-indoleacetic acid , Sigma-Aldrich ) from egg lay to adult day one and were then cultured on NGM without auxin for the remainder of their lifespan . These individuals were fully self-sterile as expected ( Kasimatis et al . , 2018 ) . Finally , the C . elegans fog-2 ( q71 ) and C . briggsae she-1 ( v35 ) feminized mutants were kept at 20°C for the entire assay . For these assays , virgin feminized individuals were isolated from males at the L4 stage and were either kept away from males for the entire lifespan or only interacted with males for 2 hr as described . Lifespan data were plotted as Kaplan-Meier survival curves in Prism 7 and statistical analyses performed using the logrank ( Mantel-Cox ) test . The number of animals ( n ) used for each assay and the number of independent biological replicates ( N ) can be found in Supplementary file 2 . To identify and isolate hermaphrodites or females that have mated during a brief period of interacting with males , we modified a previously developed technique ( Stanfield and Villeneuve , 2006 ) . The day before the mating assay , adult day one males ( for C . elegans , either him-5[e1467] or nIs128[Ppkd-2::GFP]; him-8[e1469] , for C . briggsae , Cbr-him-8[v186] , and WT for C . brenneri and C . remanei ) were fluorescently labeled by culturing them overnight on NGM plates seeded with 100 μL stationary phase OP50-1 and 5 ng/μL MitoTracker Red CMXRos ( Thermo Fisher cat# M7512 , resuspended in DMSO [Fisher] at 100x and kept at −20°C in aliquots ) at a density of approximately 100 males per 6 cm plate . On the day of the mating assay , 40 fluorescently-labeled males and 20 unlabeled hermaphrodites were placed on 6 cm NGM plates seeded with OP50-1 bacteria . Animals were allowed to interact with each other and mate for 2 hr at their normal culturing conditions . Following this period , hermaphrodites that received male sperm as a result of mating were identified based on the presence of fluorescence ( male sperm ) in their uterus and/or spermatheca ( Figure 1E and Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–D ) using a fluorescent dissecting microscope or the COPAS large particle biosorter as indicated . In a small number of cases , a hermaphrodite consumed some of the MitoTracker Red CMXRos labeled bacteria resulting in red fluorescence in the gut or throughout the body . When this occurred , the individual was censored from the experiment because of the difficulty in determining if they received male sperm or not . For mating efficiency assays , 5–7 mating plates ( n ) were typically used per experimental condition and one to two independent , biological replicates ( N ) were performed . The number of mated hermaphrodites was compared to the total number of hermaphrodites per plate ( mating efficiency = # hermaphrodites with male sperm/total # hermaphrodites ) . To better understand the dynamics of mating during a two-hour period ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1E ) , we performed a separate assay using a slightly modified version of the mating efficiency method such that two male genotypes were used . Specifically , on each plate 20 young , unlabeled hermaphrodites or feminized individuals interacted with 20 unlabeled nIs128 ( Ppkd-2::GFP ) ; him-8 ( e1469 ) males and 20 MitoTracker Red CMXRos labeled him-5 ( e1467 ) males for two hours . Following this 2 hr interaction , hermaphrodites that received male sperm from the fluorescently labeled him-5 ( e1467 ) males were isolated and placed individually on 3 cm NGM plates to lay eggs . To determine if any of these him-5 ( e1467 ) mated individuals also mated with a nIs128 ( Ppkd-2::GFP ) ; him-8 ( e1469 ) male , we looked for male progeny that carried nIs128[Ppkd-2::GFP] transgene . These individuals were thus mated at least twice and received male sperm from at least two males . For lifespan assays , approximately eight mating plates were set up per condition . Hermaphrodites or females that received male sperm were moved to fresh plates without males at a density of approximately 35 individuals per plate and tracked for the remainder of their lifespan . To better understand the resistance of young hermaphrodites to mating-induced demise , we characterized the transcriptomes of the young , WT hermaphrodites that have a normal lifespan after a brief interaction with males to those that have a shortened lifespan after a brief interaction with males ( the self-sperm depleted fem-1[hc17] feminized individuals and the middle-aged , WT hermaphrodites ) . WT and fem-1 ( hc17 ) mutant individuals were age-synchronized using a brief , 3–4 hr egg lay ( see ‘Lifespan Assays’ above ) on NGM plates seeded with OP50-1 bacteria and grown at 25°C during development and the young adult stage . On day 3 of life ( egg lay is day 0 ) , the worms were all moved to 20°C for the remainder of their lifespan . This set up resulted in fully penetrant feminized germline phenotypes for the fem-1 ( hc17 ) mutants and delayed the age-associated appearance of red autofluorescence in the gut that would have made accurate detection of MitoTracker Red CMXRos labeled male sperm in the uterus and spermatheca difficult . For each of the four biological replicates , egg lays were performed on two separate days such that there was a cohort of age-synchronized young ( day 3 of life ) and middle-aged ( day 7 of life ) hermaphrodites of both genotypes on the day of mating . Following the Materials and methods section ‘Fluorescent Sperm Tracking to Identify Mated Hermaphrodites for Mating Efficiency Assays and for Lifespan Assays’ , we identified and isolated young and middle-aged WT and fem-1 ( hc17 ) individuals that received male sperm from fluorescently labeled him-5 ( e1467 ) males and transferred them to fresh plates . At the same time , unmated hermaphrodites that never encountered a male were also moved to fresh plates at the same density ( approximately 30 worms per plate ) . After approximately 24 hr , 40 worms from each condition ( individuals of each age and genotype that either received male sperm or never interacted with males ) were picked onto an unseeded NGM plate . These worms were immediately washed twice with ice cold M9 buffer ( 22 mM KH2PO4 , 42 mM Na2PO4 , 86 mM NaCl , and 1 mM MgSO4 ) and the worm pellets were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen . The remaining worms were used to measure their lifespan ( Figure 2A–D and Supplementary file 2 ) as described in the section ‘Lifespan Assays’ . RNA was extracted from the flash frozen worm pellets with 500 μL Trizol and 200 μL chloroform followed by 250 μL phenol and 200 μL chloroform extractions and finally , an isopropanol precipitation . Remaining DNA was degraded with DNaseI ( Promega ) and the RNA cleaned with a sodium acetate and ethanol precipitation . RNA quality was measured using Nanodrop spectrophotometry and the Agilent BioAnalyzer Total RNA Nano chip and kit . mRNA enriched cDNA was prepared using 10 ng of total RNA ( quantified by Nanodrop spectrophotometry ) and the Takara SMART-seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA kit , with 8 rounds of amplification . Paired-end libraries were made using the Nextera XT DNA library prep kit ( Illumina ) with 1 ng of cDNA ( quantified using the Qubit dsDNA High Sensitivity reagents , Invitrogen ) and barcoded using the Nextera XT Index Kit v2 ( Illumina ) . Libraries were purified with 30 μL AMPure XP beads ( Beckman Coulter ) as directed in the Nextera XT kit . Library quality and quantity were assessed using the Agilent Bioanalyxer High Sensitivity DNA Assay . All samples and biological replicates ( A-D ) were pooled and sequenced on a single Illumina NextSeq run . Paired-end , 75 base pair sequencing was performed . RNA-seq reads were aligned to the WBcel235 genome and gene read counts were calculated using STAR ( version 2 . 5 . 4a ) . Low-coverage genes that had less than one read count per million mapped reads in less than three samples were filtered out . Data were normalized with a variance-stabilizing transformation ( DESeq2 version 1 . 10 . 1 ) prior to Principal Component Analysis ( PCA ) in R ( version 3 . 2 . 4 and Biobase version 2 . 30 . 0 ) . PCA was carried out using the R method ( prcomp ) . Differential expression was calculated using DESeq2 ( version 1 . 10 . 1 ) . The results from DESeq2 can be found in Figure 2—source data 1 . Gene Ontology ( GO ) enrichment was performed in R using the Fischer’s t-test and Benjamini-Hochberg corrected . Full GO enrichment results can be found in Figure 2—source data 2 . Heatmaps were generated in R using normalized read counts ( variance-stabilizing transformation ) . Code is available online ( https://github . com/brunetlab/Booth_etal_2019 . git ) . The CEH-18 network was determined using the GeneMANIA webserver ( Warde-Farley et al . , 2010 ) . The default settings were used with the exception of the types of interactions allowed ( predicted interactions and protein domain similarity were deselected ) . Networks were re-drawn based on the GeneMANIA output using Adobe Illustrator to incorporate the DESeq2 output from the RNA-seq ( Figure 2—source data 1 ) . P-values for enrichment of differentially expressed genes in the network were calculated using the hypergeometric distribution . The PSWM file for the CEH-18 DNA binding motif ( Narasimhan et al . , 2015 ) was downloaded from http://cisbp . ccbr . utoronto . ca and a publicly available CEH-18 ChIP-seq dataset ( Kudron et al . , 2018 ) was downloaded from http://epic . gs . washington . edu/modERN/ . The ChIP-seq peaks were then converted to FASTA format with bedtools ‘getfasta’ ( Quinlan and Hall , 2010 ) to be made compatible with MEME . The MEME Suite AME ( with default parameters ‘Average odds score’ and ‘Fisher’s exact test’ using shuffled input sequences as the control ) was used with the CEH-18 motif to determine statistical enrichment of the CEH-18 motif within the CEH-18 binding peaks ( McLeay and Bailey , 2010 ) . This analysis revealed significant enrichment for the CEH-18 DNA binding motif in the CEH-18 ChIP-seq peaks ( p=4 . 77×10−5 ) , though the enrichment was not strong . As a comparison , the same analysis was performed using the DAF-16 PSWM file ( http://cisbp . ccbr . utoronto . ca; Weirauch et al . , 2014 ) to test for enrichment within DAF-16 ChIP-seq peaks ( http://data . modencode . org; Contrino et al . , 2012 ) . There was very high enrichment of the DAF-16 DNA binding motif within DAF-16 ChIP-seq peaks ( p=1 . 44×10−359 ) . We next tested for the enrichment of the CEH-18 DNA binding motif in the sequences surrounding the transcription start sites of the differentially expressed genes from the RNA-seq . The ChIPSeeker ( Yu et al . , 2015 ) function ‘getPromoters’ was used with parameters ‘TxDb = TxDb . Celegans . UCSC . ce11 . refGene , upstream = 300 , downstream = 300’ to assign promoters to genes from lists of differentially expressed genes generated from the RNA-seq data with a statistical significance threshold of FDR < 0 . 05 . The resulting bed files were converted to FASTA format and inspected for motif enrichment as above using the MEME suite AME ( McLeay and Bailey , 2010; Quinlan and Hall , 2010 ) . To identify differentially expressed genes that have a nearby CEH-18 binding site , the publicly available CEH-18 ChIP-seq peaks ( Kudron et al . , 2018 ) were first de-duplicated to remove any non-unique lines , and the bed file was converted to a gRanges object using readBed ( ) from the ‘genomation’ package ( Akalin et al . , 2015 ) . The gRanges object was then annotated using annotatePeak ( ) from the ‘ChIPSeeker’ package ( Yu et al . , 2015 ) to associate peaks with a proximal gene . The CEH-18 ChIP-seq peaks that were associated with genes differentially regulated in the RNA-seq datasets were then outputted based on the annotated gene associations ( from ChIPSeeker; Yu et al . , 2015 ) . This output is Figure 4—source data 1 . Using the hypergeometric distribution test , we found that the differentially expressed genes from our RNA-seq ( comparing young hermaphrodites to young feminized individuals , mated and unmated ) were not significantly enriched for the CEH-18 binding sites . We note that our RNA-seq was performed using whole worms and that the differentially expressed genes from these data are the result of transcripts from all the tissues , many of which may not express ceh-18 . The lack of transcription factor binding enrichment , particularly in transcription factors acting in a cell- or tissue-specific manner , has been described in C . elegans ( Cao et al . , 2017; Narasimhan et al . , 2015 ) and is thought to be largely due to cell heterogeneity . Cell- or tissue-specific methods including single-cell RNA-seq could better elucidate the CEH-18 regulatory network in the somatic gonad . We then generated a list of differentially expressed genes between young hermaphrodites and young feminized individuals ( unmated and that mated with males ) that have a neighboring CEH-18 binding site by associating ChIP-seq binding peaks with nearest transcription start site using ChIPSeeker ( Yu et al . , 2015 ) . These data are in Figure 4—source data 1 . This subset of genes was then used for GO enrichment in R using the Fischer’s t-test and Benjamini-Hochberg correction . The output for the GO enrichment is Figure 4—source data 2 . As a negative control , we also performed this analysis with an unrelated transcription factor , MAB-5 and these data are presented in Figure 4—source data 1 and 2 . All code for these analyses are available online ( https://github . com/brunetlab/Booth_etal_2019 . git ) . To create a feminized C . briggsae worm that is competent for RNAi knock-down by ingested dsRNA , we crossed the she-1 ( v35 ) feminized strain to a transgenic strain ( mfIs42[Cel-sid-2; Cel-myo-2::DsRed] ) that is susceptible to ingested dsRNA ( Nuez and Félix , 2012 ) . Worms that were homozygous for the she-1 ( v35 ) mutation were determined by PCR followed by Sanger sequencing using the following primers: 5’- CAATTGTCATGCGACCAGATTT −3’ 5’- GCTTGTCCGAAACCAATGAAC −3’ The homozygous presence of the mfIs42[Cel-sid-2; Cel-myo-2::DsRed] integration was determined by observing transmission of the DsRed marker in all progeny for several generations . Portions of the highly conserved Cbr-ceh-18 and Cbr-vab-1 genes ( Figure 5—figure supplement 2A ) were amplified from C . briggsae ( strain AF16 ) genomic DNA and the DsRed transgenic marker ( from JU1018 genomic DNA ) using Platinum HiFi Supermix ( Invitrogen ) and the following primers: Cbr-ceh-18: 5’-GGTCCTCGAGGTATTCACCAACGGCAACAAC-3’ and 5’-GCGTACTAGTGGTCCTCTTCCTTCTTCTCTTG-3’ Cbr-vab-1: 5’-GGTCCTCGAGAGTGTGGATCCGTTGTGATG-3’ and 5’-GCGTACTAGTGGAAATCCAACTCACCCTATGA-3’ dsRed: 5’-GGTCCTCGAGGAACGTCATCACCGAGTTCAT-3’ and 5’-GCGTACTAGTGATGGTGTAGTCCTCGTTGTG-3’ The PCR products and the L4440 vector were digested with SpeI and XhoI ( New England Biolabs ) . Ligation was performed with T4 ligase ( New England Biolabs ) . The ligation products were first transformed into TOP10 chemically competent cells ( Invitrogen ) . After verification of the plasmids by Sanger sequencing , the correct plasmids were transformed into chemically competent HT115 E . coli . HT115 bacteria containing these plasmids were used for RNAi knock-down by feeding in C . briggsae ( mfIs42[Cel-sid-2; Cel-myo-2::DsRed] ) ( see ‘Lifespan Assays’ above ) . Worms were prepared for imaging using 1 mM sodium azide and mounted on a 2% agarose pad . The images presented and quantified in Figure 5—figure supplement 3 were taken using a Zeiss Axioskop 2 Plus . All images for an experiment were taken using the same exposure length . DsRed fluorescence was quantified in Fiji ( Schindelin et al . , 2012 ) using the mean gray value of the pharynx bulb . To measure the conservation of orthologs of the sperm-sensing proteins CEH-18 and VAB-1 , the sequences of these proteins were downloaded from www . wormbase . org ( WBcel235 ) and aligned using MUSCLE v3 . 8 ( Edgar , 2004a; Edgar , 2004b ) . These protein alignments were input to the JalView visualization tool ( Waterhouse et al . , 2009 ) to generate Figure 5—figure supplement 2A . Protein domains ( pfam ) were determined by www . wormbase . org . Data are available in the main text or supplementary materials . RNA-seq reads are available online at NCBI SRA ( PRJNA508378 ) and all code used for RNA-seq analysis is available online ( https://github . com/brunetlab/Booth_etal_2019 . git; copy archived at https://github . com/elifesciences-publications/Booth_etal_2019; Booth , 2019 ) ."}
{"doi": "elife-16178-v1", "abstract": "Understanding the neural basis of behaviour requires studying brain activity in behaving subjects using complementary techniques that measure neural responses at multiple spatial scales , and developing computational tools for understanding the mapping between these measurements . Here we report the first results of widefield imaging of genetically encoded calcium indicator ( GCaMP6f ) signals from V1 of behaving macaques . This technique provides a robust readout of visual population responses at the columnar scale over multiple mm2 and over several months . To determine the quantitative relation between the widefield GCaMP signals and the locally pooled spiking activity , we developed a computational model that sums the responses of V1 neurons characterized by prior single unit measurements . The measured tuning properties of the GCaMP signals to stimulus contrast , orientation and spatial position closely match the predictions of the model , suggesting that widefield GCaMP signals are linearly related to the summed local spiking activity .", "plain language summary": "An important question in brain research is how neurons and the circuits they form process information to produce behavior . To understand what happens in a human brain , it is necessary to study a brain of similar complexity , such as that of a primate . Examining how the neurons in a brain region called the visual cortex process information about what we see is especially informative . This is because animals can be taught to perform different visual tasks , and because the visual cortex is relatively easy to access . In principle , therefore , it should be possible to use modern genetic and imaging techniques to study the primate visual system , but , until now , that has not been the case . Like much of the brain , the visual cortex consists of different classes of neurons that can excite , inhibit or modulate the activity of neighboring neurons . One way to study how these different classes of neurons interact with each other is to alter the animal’s DNA , such that only one cell type stands out during the experiment , allowing its role in the brain to be closely monitored . This technique has been used to study the interactions among neurons in the rodent brain , because rodent DNA is easy to alter . However , it is not easy to manipulate primate DNA . Seidemann et al . have , therefore , developed a new technique that can target a specific class of neurons , allowing the activity of just these cells to be distinguished from the rest . The method uses specially designed harmless viruses to produce foreign proteins in the excitatory neurons of the visual cortex in an adult macaque . The optical properties of the proteins change when the neuron they are in is active , allowing the activity of the excitatory neurons to be detected and tracked in awake animals while they perform a visual task . Previously , the activity of neurons in the primate visual cortex could only be measured using dyes that indiscriminately reported the activity of all the neurons present . Seidemann et al . found that , in addition to being more selective than the dye-based method , the new technique also more accurately depicted neuronal action potentials , which are the primary units of information in the brain . Seidemann et al . now plan to use a similar method to study the activity of the inhibitory neurons of the primate visual cortex . Further examination of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons at much higher magnification , using a different microscopy technique , will also reveal more subtle features of their responses during visual tasks .", "article": "1 Introduction Understanding the contribution of a particular cortical area to mental phenomena such as perception necessitates analysis of neural activity across multiple spatial and temporal scales and over broad regions of cortical surface . For example , in primate primary visual cortex ( V1 ) , the smallest localized stimulus activates an area of multiple mm2 ( Hubel and Wiesel , 1974; Palmer et al . , 2012; Van Essen et al . , 1984 ) , a region containing millions of neurons . Current techniques for measuring neural activity in behaving animals suffer from a fundamental tradeoff between resolution ( spatial and temporal ) and coverage , such that , even in a simple perceptual task with a localized stimulus , no single technique can measure the activity of all potentially relevant neurons in a given cortical area with single neuron resolution . Therefore , to advance our understanding of the neural basis of behavior , we need to ( i ) complement techniques that provide single-neuron access over a limited region with techniques that capture neural population responses over a large region , and ( ii ) develop computational tools that describe the mapping between neural signals measured using different techniques and combined across different spatial scales . The macaque is an important animal model for human perception , cognition and motor planning , but many of the advanced optical and genetic tools available in rodents and simpler organisms are unavailable in the macaque . Beyond an early study with limited success ( Heider et al . , 2010 ) , there are no reports of successful use of genetically encoded reporters in the macaque . Therefore , there is a growing need to translate advanced optical-genetic techniques to primates and other higher mammals . Here we report results of a new method using the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6f ( Chen et al . , 2013 ) for chronic imaging of neural population responses at the scale of orientation columns in V1 of behaving monkeys . Macaque V1 is arguably the most studied and best characterized cortical area in the primate brain . An important feature of macaque V1 is its topographic organization , which includes a large-scale retinotopic map ( Adams and Horton , 2003; Van Essen et al . , 1984; Yang et al . , 2007 ) and a finer scale orientation map ( Bonhoeffer and Grinvald , 1991; Chen et al . , 2012; Hubel and Wiesel , 1963 ) . The topographic organization of the orientation map at the columnar scale , which is absent from rodent V1 ( Ohki et al . , 2005 ) , together with the existing extensive knowledge of the tuning properties of V1 neurons , make macaque V1 an ideal testbed for new imaging techniques and for studying the link between locally pooled neural population responses and single neuron responses . 2 Results Our first goal was to find a viral vector system and an injection protocol that provide reliable and stable GCaMP expression for imaging in macaque V1 . To do this , we took advantage of our expertise in long-term maintenance ( >6 months ) of a large ( 18 mm diameter ) cortical window with direct physical and optical access to the awake macaque brain ( Figure 1 ) . With this window , it is possible to test in parallel more than a dozen combinations of vectors and injection parameters . Initial injections were performed with enhanced green fluorescent protein ( EGFP ) to test recombinant adeno-associated virus ( rAAV ) serotypes and promoters that have proven effective in the rodent ( see Experimental Procedures ) . Following injection , each chamber was monitored weekly with epi-fluorescence imaging to track transgene expression levels . Injection sites were easily tracked based on high magnification images of the vasculature . Based on preliminary measurements , we selected serotype 1 rAAVs and CaMKIIα promoter ( Dittgen et al . , 2004 ) for expressing GCaMP . Glass micropipettes were used to inject small volumes ( 1–2 µL ) of rAAV:CaMKII-GCaMP6f into V1 of three macaque monkeys . Six to seven weeks post-injection , high levels of transgene expression could be observed over an area of ~6–10 mm2 per injection site ( Figure 2A ) . Based on in situ hybridization analysis of gene expression at the injection site in one animal , approximately 80 percent of cells were CaMKIIα-positive and , therefore , excitatory . Further , all neurons expressing GCaMP were CaMKIIα-positive , attesting to the fidelity of the viral promoter ( Figure 3 ) . There was no evidence of apoptotic neurons , as judged by Hoechst 33342 staining 10 weeks post-injection ( not shown ) . Once GCaMP fluorescence had been detected , we used widefield epi-fluorescence imaging to characterize the nature of the GCaMP signals carried by populations of V1 neurons while the monkeys performed a fixation task . 10 . 7554/eLife . 16178 . 003Figure 1 .

While the monkeys maintained gaze at the center of the screen , high contrast sinusoidal grating stimuli at 12 equally spaced orientations were flashed at 4 Hz for 4–6 cycles . Stimulus trials were mixed with blank fixation trials , and all conditions were randomly interleaved . Clear GCaMP signals were entrained on each stimulus cycle ( Figure 2B ) . These signals provided a robust readout of visual responses with a high signal to noise ratio ( SNR ) , which was stable for up to six months ( Figure 4A ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 16178 . 006Figure 4 . Stability of GCaMP signals over time and cortical map . ( A ) Signal amplitudes and d’ ( signal amplitude over signal standard deviation ) to large flashed gratings over a period of ~200 days after viral injection for two monkeys .

The correlation coefficient between the two gray-scale maps is 0 . 80 . ( E ) One example of VSD orientation map at the same site as ( C ) and ( D ) , but 55 days before viral injection . The correlation coefficients between the map in ( E ) and the maps in ( C ) and ( D ) are 0 . 71 and 0 . 78 , respectively . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 16178 . 006 To determine if the detected signals can be used to extract orientation maps , we measured the GCaMP responses across 10 repeats per orientation , computed as the 4 Hz Fourier amplitude of the average GCaMP signal acquired at each location , and applied a bandpass spatial filter ( 0 . 8–3 cycle/mm ) to remove non-orientation-selective responses and high frequency noise ( Figure 2C ) . To verify that the observed maps reflected orientation columns , we computed the Pearson correlation between all pairs of maps , and then averaged the correlations across all pairs of maps with the same stimulus orientation difference ( Figure 2D ) . As expected from the known structure of orientation maps in V1 , the pairwise correlations changed smoothly from positive values for maps produced by nearby orientations to negative values for maps produced by orthogonal orientations . We used the maps produced by each orientation to compute the composite orientation map , in which color indicates the preferred orientation and saturation the strength of orientation tuning ( Figure 2E ) . This composite map reveals the semi-periodic organization of the orientation map , including the orientation pinwheels ( see inset ) ( Bonhoeffer and Grinvald , 1991 ) . To determine the consistency of these composite orientation maps across days and between GCaMP and voltage sensitive dye ( VSD ) , we converted the color map of preferred orientation to a grayscale map in the range of [−1 , 1] by taking the sine of the preferred orientation times two ( Figure 4C ) . The converted orientation maps are consistent with maps obtained from the same region with VSD imaging and were stable for several months ( Figure 4B–E ) . A major challenge with any novel technique is to understand the nature of the measured signals . Our next goal was to understand the relationship between widefield GCAMP responses and the responses of single neurons . This relationship is difficult to predict because the widefield measurements may reflect calcium signals due to spikes as well as calcium signals due to synaptic potentials in dendrites . Even if the GCAMP signals are dominated by spikes , it can be difficult , and sometimes impossible , to predict properties of population responses from single-unit measurements ( e . g . , Seidemann et al . , 2009 ) . For example , in the present case , it is possible that the spike-to-calcium nonlinearities in single neurons ( e . g . , Akerboom et al . , 2012; Chen et al . , 2013 ) average out when pooling responses over many heterogeneous neurons , leading to widefield GCaMP signals that are linearly related to the summed local spiking activity . As a first step in characterizing the relationship between widefield GCAMP responses and single unit responses , we measured the tuning properties of GCaMP signals to three fundamental visual stimulus dimensions , and compared these tuning properties to those obtained with widefield VSD imaging . We then developed a computational model that sums the spiking ( and subthreshold ) activity of a local population of V1 neurons , characterized by prior single unit measurements , and compared the model’s predictions with the observed tuning properties of GCaMP and VSD signals . We examined the tuning properties of V1 GCaMP responses across stimulus orientation , contrast and position . To compute orientation tuning , we measured how the response at each imaged cortical location changed as a function of the difference between stimulus orientation and the location’s preferred orientation , and then averaged these curves across all locations in our region of interest ( ROI; Figure 2F ) . The orientation tuning curve contains an orientation selective component and a large non-selective component , reflecting the fact that the local GCaMP signal pools responses from an area with a heterogeneous population of neurons ( see below ) . Next , we examined how V1 responses in the same region change as a function of stimulus contrast ( Figure 2G ) . The response was weak at low contrasts ( <12% ) and increased monotonically at higher contrasts . Finally , to examine position tuning , we measured GCaMP responses in a small ROI to localized Gabor stimuli ( sine-wave grating in a Gaussian window ) presented at different distances from the ROI’s location in the visual field . Prior to these experiments , we used VSD imaging to obtain a precise retinotopic map of the entire recording chamber ( Figure 5; Yang et al . , 2007 ) . We used the retinotopic map to estimate , for each stimulus position , the cortical distance ( in mm ) between the center of the region activated by the stimulus and the center of our ROI . The GCaMP responses dropped rapidly as the stimulus’ representation deviated from the recorded ROI’s location , and no responses were observed when the distance exceeded 2 mm ( Figure 2H ) . Similar GCaMP tuning curves for contrast , position and orientation were observed across multiple experiments spanning several months in two monkeys ( Figure 6A–C , blue symbols; thin blue curves show results from two monkeys separately ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 16178 . 007Figure 5 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 16178 . 008 To better understand the nature and source of the widefield GCaMP signals in macaque V1 , we compared the GCaMP tuning curves with those obtained using VSD imaging . Recent results suggest that local VSD signals in behaving monkeys reflect the membrane potential of cortical neurons pooled over a Gaussian shaped region with a space constant of ~200 µM ( Chen et al . , 2012 ) . This pooling is likely to be primarily caused by lateral spread of neural processes—a small volume of cortical tissue contains axons and dendrites of neurons whose somata can be located several hundred microns away ( Chen et al . , 2012 ) . Here we assume that this pooling area is comparable for widefield imaging of VSD and GCaMP signals . What is the expected relation between widefield GCAMP and VSD signals if the GCaMP signal measures primarily the locally pooled spiking activity while the VSD signal measures locally pooled membrane potential ? Due to the threshold nonlinearity between membrane potential and spiking activity in single neurons ( Priebe and Ferster , 2008 ) , stimuli that produce weak or moderate membrane potential response elicit almost no spiking activity . Therefore , the spiking responses of V1 neurons are more narrowly tuned for orientation and position and are less sensitive to low contrasts ( Priebe and Ferster , 2008 ) . In addition , the spike threshold nonlinearity causes spiking activity to have a smaller non-orientation-selective response relative to membrane potential ( Priebe and Ferster , 2008 ) . Therefore , if the GCaMP signal measures primarily the locally pooled spiking activity , then we would expect GCaMP responses to be less sensitive to contrast , more narrowly tuned to orientation and position , and to have a smaller non-orientation-selective response than VSD signals . A comparison of VSD ( red symbols , Figure 6A–C; thin red curves show results from two monkeys separately ) and GCaMP responses is largely consistent with these predictions , suggesting that the GCaMP signal may be proportional to the locally summed spiking activity . To further investigate the hypothesis that GCaMP responses measure pooled spiking activity while VSD responses measure pooled membrane potential , we evaluated a simple population model of GCaMP and VSD responses ( Figure 7 ) . This model capitalizes on the extensive measurements of single neuron activity that have been made in primate V1 over the last 40 years . Specifically , much is known about the distributions of the tuning properties of V1 neurons , as well as their functional organization ( e . g . , Table 1; Hubel and Wiesel , 1974; Nauhaus et al . , 2012; Van Essen et al . , 1984 ) , making it possible for us to construct the model directly from single neuron measurements made by us and others . In the model , the membrane potential of neuron i is controlled by its linear receptive field ( Li ) and a contrast gain control mechanism , where gain decreases monotonically with contrast at a rate that is controlled by a semi-saturation parameter ( C50i ) . Spikes are obtained by passing the membrane potential through a power-law spiking nonlinearity having an exponent ns ( Priebe and Ferster , 2008 ) . This is the standard descriptive model that has been used to summarize the response properties of single neurons in V1 ( e . g . , Adelson and Bergen , 1985; Albrecht and Geisler , 1991; Heeger , 1992 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 16178 . 009Figure 7 . A computational framework relating GCaMP and VSD signals to single neuron membrane potential and spiking activity . Membrane potential of V1 neurons reflect a dot product of the visual input with the linear receptive field followed by contrast gain control . The neural mechanism producing spikes from membrane potential is described by a power-law non-linearity . As a first approximation , GCaMP and VSD signals reflect spiking activity and membrane potential , respectively , pooled over a local population of neurons with heterogeneous tuning properties .

The relative contribution of neurons with a particular C50 value to the pool is given by the distribution in Figure 8A ( top ) , which approximates prior single unit measurements ( Table 1 ) . To obtain the predicted position tuning functions , we assume that individual neurons have a receptive field size ( in mm ) that is the average measured at this region of V1 ( Table 1 ) , and that the response at a given cortical location is the summed activity of a population of V1 neurons having scattered receptive field centers . The relative contribution to the sum of a neuron with a particular receptive field center is given by a spatial scatter function ( Figure 8B , top ) . Similarly , to obtain the predicted orientation tuning function we assume that individual neurons have the average orientation bandwidth of V1 neurons ( Table 1 ) and that the response at a given location reflects the summed activity of a population of V1 neurons with different preferred orientations . The relative contribution to the sum of neurons with a particular preferred orientation is given by an orientation scatter function ( Figure 8C , top ) . The position and orientation scatter functions reflect multiple factors that contribute to the broadening of the population tuning relative to that of single neurons ( see Experimental Procedures ) . Due to the fine spatial scale of orientation maps ( period of ~0 . 7 mm; ( Chen et al . , 2012; Hubel and Wiesel , 1963 ) and their semi-periodic nature , orientation scatter has a particularly large impact on the population orientation tuning curves . The widths of the position and orientation scatter functions are the only free parameters in the model . All other parameters , including the spiking nonlinearity exponent ns , are taken from prior single unit studies ( see Experimental Procedures and Table 1 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 16178 . 011Figure 8 .

In all stimulus dimensions ( contrast , position and orientation ) , the simulation predicted GCaMP and VSD responses closely approximate the measured responses . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 16178 . 011 The model’s predicted tuning curves for contrast , position and orientation are qualitatively consistent with the observed GCaMP and VSD tuning curves ( Figure 8A–C , bottom panels ) , providing support for the hypothesis that widefield GCaMP signals reflect the linearly summed local spiking activity , while widefield VSD signals reflect the linearly summed local membrane potential . To further compare the widefield GCaMP and VSD signals , we examined the dynamics of the visually evoked responses measured with these two techniques . Figure 9A shows the average time course of the GCaMP signal in the 22 experiments used to determine orientation selectivity of GCaMP signals ( Figure 6C , blue symbols ) . The stimulus was presented for six cycles at 4 Hz ( 100 ms on , 150 ms off ) . Clear modulation to each stimulus presentation can be seen , but because the GCaMP signal does not return to baseline between presentations , the response builds up across the six stimulus presentations . Figure 9B shows the response collapsed across the six cycles . Figure 9C–D show the average time course of the VSD signal in the 10 experiments used to determine orientation selectivity of VSD signals ( Figure 6C , red symbols ) . The stimulus was presented for five cycles at 5 Hz ( 60 ms on , 140 ms off ) . The VSD signal appears to rise and decay more rapidly , and does not show the same degree of buildup as the GCaMP signal . To compare the dynamics of the rising and falling edges of the GCaMP and VSD responses , we collapsed the responses across cycles , normalized the responses to their peak , and superimposed the GCaMP and VSD responses ( Figure 9E ) . The latency of the VSD signal is shorter than the latency of the GCaMP signal . Similarly , the slope of the rising edge of the VSD signal is steeper than the slope of the rising edge of the GCaMP signal . Direct comparison of the slope and time-to-peak between these measurements is somewhat problematic because of the differences in the stimulus presentation protocol . To examine the dynamics of the falling edges , we aligned the two signals to the time of their peak ( Figure 9E , right ) . The GCaMP signal falls off more slowly than the VSD signal , consistent with the differences in the buildup . 10 . 7554/eLife . 16178 . 012Figure 9 .

When collapsing the response across cycles in A–E , the responses to each cycle were first anchored by subtracting the mean response in the first 36 ms ( 4 frames ) for VSD and 50 ms ( 1 frame ) for GCaMP after stimulus onset . Results from the same experiments as in Figure 6C . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 16178 . 012 Finally , we compared the two signals in terms of their amplitude ( Figure 9F , left ) and signal-to-noise ratio ( Figure 9F , right ) . The GCaMP signal is about five times larger than the VSD signal , but the two signals are comparable in terms of their sensitivity ( d’ ) . 3 Discussion Here we report results of a new method for widefield imaging of GCaMP signals over multiple months from behaving macaque V1 . This method provides high quality access to neural population activity at the scale of cortical columns . We measured the tuning properties of the GCaMP signals and compared them with those of VSD signals . We found that GCaMP signals are less sensitive to contrast and are more selective to position and orientation than VSD signals . We then developed a simple computational framework for modeling the relation between neural signals measured with different techniques and at different spatial scales . We used this framework to test the hypothesis that widefield GCaMP and VSD signals in V1 of behaving monkeys reflect the linearly summed local neural population activity at the level spiking activity and membrane potential , respectively . The general agreement between the model’s predictions and our empirical results supports this hypothesis and provides means to link neural signals measured at different spatial scales and with different techniques . Because mammalian cortical representations are widely distributed , understanding the role of a particular cortical area in behavior necessitates complementing techniques that provide single-neuron access over a limited region with techniques that capture neural population responses over a large region of multiple mm2 . Chronic widefield imaging of genetically encoded indicators provides a promising approach to achieve this important goal . Our study represents several key advancements over a recent study using similar techniques in anesthetized ferrets ( Smith et al . , 2015 ) . First , our experiments are performed in behaving primates that are an important and widely used model system . Second , we perform longitudinal measurements over several months , rather than acute experiments . Third , we develop a computational model that quantitatively links widefield measurements with single unit measurements and provides evidence that the widefield GCaMP signals are dominated by the summed spiking activity of local populations of neurons . Widefield GCaMP imaging complements VSD imaging , another important tool for studying the dynamics of neural population responses in behaving primates ( e . g . , Chen et al . , 2006; Gilad et al . , 2013; Michel et al . , 2013; Muller et al . , 2014; Seidemann et al . , 2002 ) , because it measures a different aspect of neural population activity . GCaMP imaging offers several advantages over other widefield imaging techniques in behaving animals . The amplitude of the GCaMP signal is nearly an order of magnitude larger than that of VSD or intrinsic imaging ( Figure 9F ) . The GCAMP signal has much higher temporal resolution than intrinsic imaging ( Figure 2B ) , although somewhat less than VSD imaging ( Figure 9 ) . In GCaMP imaging , a single viral injection procedure generates stable expression of a calcium indicator for many months ( Figure 4 ) . This eliminates the need for a repeated , challenging and variable-quality staining procedures necessary for VSD imaging . GCaMP signals are also less susceptible to bleaching than VSD signals , accommodating longer and more frequent imaging sessions . Thus , GCaMP imaging can be used to monitor the same cortical region over multiple months in behaving subjects , enabling new types of experiments , such as studies comparing neural and behavioral sensitivities in perceptual tasks with large ensembles of complex and naturalistic stimuli . Thus , chronic widefield GCaMP imaging in behaving animals is likely to become a widely used and powerful technique . Our quantitative measurements of the tuning properties of the widefield GCaMP signals and our computational model suggest that these signals reflect the pooled spiking activity of layer 2/3 neurons rather than their pooled synaptic potentials or pre-synaptic inputs . Had the GCaMP widefield signal been dominated by synaptic potentials in dendrites or pre-synaptic inputs , their tuning properties should have matched those obtained with VSD . The large and consistent differences between the tuning properties of the widefield GCaMP and VSD signals ( Figure 6 ) , and the match between the model’s predictions and the observed tuning properties ( Figure 8 ) , support the conclusion that the widefield GCaMP signal is tightly linked to the local spikes in layer 2/3 . However , this result does not imply a lack of contribution from dendrites to the widefield GCaMP signal . Comparably tuned dendritic and somatic GCaMP6 signals have been recorded in rodent V1 using two-photon imaging ( Chen et al . , 2013 ) , and we have obtained similar results in two-photon GCaMP6 experiments in macaque V1 ( Nauhaus , Ko , Chen and Seidemann , unpublished observations ) . Therefore , stimulus-evoked dendritic GCaMP signals may be more correlated with the spiking output of layer 2/3 cells than with their synaptic inputs . Factors promoting dendritic GCaMP signals with tuning properties that are more similar to the spiking output than to the synaptic input could include backpropagating action potentials ( Larkum et al . , 2007; Waters et al . , 2003 ) , as well as nonlinear dendritic NMDA mechanisms ( Major et al . , 2013; Xu et al . , 2012 ) . Another important factor that is likely to contribute to the differences between the tuning properties of the widefield GCaMP and VSD signals is that the VSD signal is proportional to membrane surface area , while the GCaMP signal is proportional to cytosolic volume . The current study represents one of the first steps in characterizing the relation between neural responses measured with different techniques and at different spatial scales . Our understanding of this relation needs to be improved in multiple ways . First , we need better quantitative measures of the relation between the optical signals , membrane potential and spiking activity at the level of single neurons . Second , we need a more detailed description of the heterogeneity and topographic organization of the tuning properties of single neurons in the cortex . Finally , we need better estimates of the various optical and biological factors that contribute to the spatial blur that underlies the pooled widefield optical signals . Our successful use of GCaMP over multiple months opens the door for several exciting future technical advancements in behaving primates , including genetically targeted cell-type-specific imaging of neural populations and two-photon imaging of small neural populations with single-cell resolution . Indeed , preliminary results from two-photon imaging in anesthetized macaque expressing GCaMP6f show healthy neurons and characteristic paranuclear responses to visual stimuli , indicating that GCaMP imaging at cellular resolution can complement widefield imaging at the same anatomical location ( Nauhaus , Ko , Chen and Seidemann , unpublished observations ) . Combining widefield and two-photon GCaMP imaging in the same animal over extended periods of time should help resolve many of the remaining questions regarding the relationship between neural responses measured over different spatial scales . Combining complementary empirical measurements with realistic computational models that interpolate fine-scale and large-scale measurements will provide unprecedented access to distributed neural responses in behaving subjects , leading to a deeper understanding of neural population coding in the brain . 4 Materials and methods To screen viral vectors and optimize the injection protocol , we took advantage of our expertise in long-term maintenance of a large cortical window with direct physical and optical access to the awake macaque brain ( Figure 1 ) . Following injection , each chamber was monitored weekly with epi-fluorescence imaging to track transgene expression levels . Injection sites were easily tracked based on high magnification images of the vasculature . Initial test infections were performed using serotype 1 , 8 , and 9 rAAVs encoding a mouse synapsin promoter and EGFP . Viruses were assembled using a helper-free system ( Agilent Technologies , Santa Clara , CA ) , and purified on sequential cesium gradients according to published methods ( Grieger et al . , 2006 ) . Viral titers were measured using a payload-independent quantitation technique ( Aurnhammer et al . , 2012 ) . Typical titers were >1010 genomes/microliter . To aid injection monitoring , 0 . 4% trypan blue ( w/v ) was diluted 1:10 in aCSF and added into the viral suspension . Injections were performed while the monkey was awake using methods similar to those recently developed for intracellular recording from behaving monkeys ( Tan et al . , 2014 ) . A pulled glass needle ( 15 µm tip diameter ) containing the suspension was lowered under surgical microscope guidance through an opening in the imaging chamber , puncturing the pia . Injection depths were measured from the point of contact between needle and brain surface . Virus was deposited at depths of 1 . 5 , 1 . 0 and 0 . 5 mm ( 0 . 5 µl per site ) using a positive displacement microinjector ( Nanoject II ) . With the injector in slow mode , 0 . 5 µl of virus was delivered manually in 10 x 50 nl steps , with approximately 30 s pauses between steps . After virus was delivered , the needle was left in place for 10 min before being withdrawn . The last injection normally produced an easily visualized dye-stained region near the surface of the brain; the region continued to spread laterally in the minutes to hours following the injection , covering 5–10 mm2 of cortex ( Figure 1A ) . Importantly , the depth of the final injection was adjusted , such that staining was visible , but virus was not leaking from the injection site . Test experiments with rAAV:mSYN-EGFP produced regions of EGFP fluorescence ( after 1–2 weeks ) roughly matching the contours of dye patches ( Figure 1B ) . Fluorescence signals associated with rAAV serotypes 1 , 8 and 9 were qualitatively similar . Hence , serotype 1 rAAVs was used for the GCaMP experiments . We then tested several viral and mammalian promoters for the ability to express EGFP in primate cortex . Based on preliminary measurements , promoter strength matched that observed in the rodent ( unpublished observations ) : mSYN≈hSYN<<CaMKIIα<CAG ( Borghuis et al . , 2011; Dittgen et al . , 2004; Niwa et al . , 1991; Kügler et al . , 2003 ) . Viral vectors rAAV:hSYN-GCaMP6f , rAAV:CamKII-GCaMP6f , rAAV:CAG-GCaMP6f were tested . The CAG vector produced high levels of unvarying basal fluorescence , consistent with compromised cell function . rAAV:CamKII-GCaMP6f at a titer of 1 . 3 x 1011 viral genomes per microliter produced more robust GCaMP signals than the hSYN vector , and was , therefore , used for all experiments reported here . Future studies , including two-photon imaging , will more closely examine GCaMP signals obtained with hSYN , CamKIIα and other cell type-specific promoters . GCaMP fluorescence was observed 40 days following injection , peaking around 75 days , and remained constant for up to 190 days after injection ( Figure 4A ) . The decrease in signal quality beyond this period was primarily caused by general deterioration of the health of the chamber . Future studies will examine the longer term stability of GCaMP expression . Multiplexed hybridization to GCaMP and CamK2α transcripts was performed using the RNAscope system ( Advanced Cell Diagnostics ) . Briefly , cortical tissue was collected using a 4 mm biopsy punch ( Integra ) and immediately frozen in OCT medium ( Tissue Tek ) . Tissue blocks were cryosectioned at 12 μm ( Leica CM3050S ) and processed according to manufacturer instructions . Fixed and dehydrated sections were co-hybridized with proprietary probes to GFP ( to detect GCaMP ) and CamKIIα , followed by selective fluorescence tagging . Signals in cells identified using DAPI staining were co-localized on a confocal microscope ( Leica DM6000 ) . Monkeys performed a visual fixation task . To obtain fluid reward , monkeys had to maintain fixation within a small window ( <2 deg full width ) centered on a small fixation point for 2–4 s . Eye position was monitored by an infrared eye tracker ( Dr . Bouis or EyeLink ) . To measure contrast and orientation tuning , we used a large sine wave grating ( 6 x 6 deg2 ) centered over the receptive fields of the infected neurons . For position tuning we used a small Gabor patch ( σ = 1/6°; spatial frequency 2 cpd ) presented along a linear trajectory at different distances in the visual field from the average receptive field of the neurons within a small ROI . For contrast and position tuning , visual stimuli were flashed 2–3 times per trial at 2 Hz ( 200 ms on; 300 ms off ) . Widefield measures of population responses with GCaMP and VSD contain a large non-orientation-selective component ( Figures 2F , 6C ) . Because the orientation selective signals are small , we had to increase our SNR in order to obtain high quality orientation maps and orientation-tuning curves . To increase the SNR , gratings were flashed at 4 Hz ( 100 on , 150 off ) for GCaMP imaging and at 5 Hz ( 60 ms on , 140 ms off ) for VSD imaging , in a period of 1 or 1 . 5 s . Additional tests verified that maps and tuning curves obtained with VSD at 4 and 5 Hz are identical ( data not shown ) . Similarly , additional tests showed that the relation between the contrast and spatial tuning curves obtained with GCaMP and VSD imaging remains the same irrespective of the stimulus presentation frequency ( data not shown ) . The mean luminance of the screen was maintained at 30 cd/m2 . All stimulus conditions were randomly interleaved and repeated at least 10 times . All procedures have been approved by the University of Texas Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and conform to NIH standards . The experimental techniques for optical imaging in behaving monkeys have been described in detail elsewhere ( Arieli et al . , 2002; Chen et al . , 2006; Shtoyerman et al . , 2000 ) . Briefly , each animal was implanted with a metal head post and a metal recording chamber located over the dorsal portion of V1 , a region representing the lower contralateral visual field at eccentricities of 2–5 deg ( Figure 5 ) . Craniotomy and durotomy were performed in order to obtain a chronic cranial window . A transparent artificial dura made of silicone was used to protect the brain while allowing optical access for imaging . We imaged GCaMP signals from V1 of two monkeys . VSD imaging was obtained from V1 of seven monkeys including one monkey that was subsequently used for GCaMP imaging ( three monkeys contributed to position tuning , four monkeys for orientation tuning and two monkeys for contrast tuning ) using methods described previously ( Chen et al . , 2006; 2008 ) . Epi-fluorescence imaging was performed with an imaging system ( Imager 3001/M , Optical Imaging ) using the following filter sets: GCaMP , excitation 470/24 nm , dichroic 505 nm , emission 515 nm cutoff glass filter; VSD , excitation 620/30 nm , dichroic 660 nm , emission 665 nm cutoff glass filter ) . Illumination was obtained with an LED light source ( X-Cite120LED ) for GCaMP or a QTH lamp ( Zeiss ) for VSD imaging . Data acquisition was time locked to the animal’s heartbeat . Imaging was performed at 20 Hz for GCaMP imaging and 100 Hz for VSD imaging . Imaging signals were averaged across repeats , and the average time course in blank trials was subtracted from the response in each stimulus condition . For contrast and position tuning , neural signals were integrated over a 200 ms window starting 35 ms after stimulus onset . For orientation tuning , the response was the first harmonic amplitude obtained by FFT of the temporal response ( as in ( Chen et al . , 2012 ) . For contrast and orientation tuning of the GCaMP signal , tuning curves were computed over an ROI of 1 . 6 x 1 . 6 mm2 centered at the location with the maximal d’ ( average signal amplitude over signal SD ) . For VSD , the ROI was the region with d’>3 . For position tuning of the GCaMP and VSD signals , the tuning curves were computed over an ROI of 0 . 75 x 0 . 75 mm2 centered at the retinotopic representation of the center stimulus . Each response curve was normalized by the peak value , then , averaged across experiments and monkeys ( Figure 6 ) . We examined how the measured GCaMP and VSD responses relate to neural activity using a simple model of V1 neural response ( Figure 7 ) . The model of membrane-potential and spiking activity is based on tuning parameter values of single V1 neurons measured by us and by others ( see Table 1 ) . We then simulated population pooling to obtain predictions that could be compared with the recorded GCaMP and VSD responses . We modeled membrane-potential response for contrast ( Lc ) , spatial position ( Lx ) and orientation ( Lθ ) as follows:Lc=cc2+C502 Lx=exp⟮−2log4 ( x−x0W^x ) 2⟯ Lθ=f^θexp⟮−2log4 ( θ−θ0W^θ ) 2⟯+ ( 1−f^θ ) where c is the contrast level , C50 is the contrast semi-saturation constant , x is spatial position , x0 is the center of the receptive field ( RF ) , W^x is the full-width RF size at half maximum , θ is stimulus orientation , θ0 is the preferred orientation , W^θ is the full-width orientation bandwidth at half maximum , and f^θ is the fraction of tuned response . Spiking response was the membrane-potential response raised to an exponent ns:Rc=Lc nsRx=Lx nsRθ=Lθ ns As tuning parameters are most commonly reported for spiking activity , the equivalent values for membrane potentials ( hatted parameters ) were derived from spiking values by undoing the effect of the spiking non-linearity:W^x=WxnsW^θ=Wθnsf^θ=1− ( 1−fθ ) 1/ns Next , we simulate population pooling in VSD and GCaMP imaging . The neurons contributing to the population responses at a given location are assumed to have a distribution of preferred position and orientation . The dispersion in preferred position and orientation results from multiple factors , including optical and biological blurring , biological scatter in tuning properties of neighboring neurons , and for position tuning , the size of the ROI . The neurons contributing to the population response at a given location are assumed to have a distribution of contrast semi-saturation values . However , because there is no known topographic organization of semi-saturation values , the factors that cause the dispersion in preferred position and orientation have no effect on the distribution of semi-saturation values . The distribution of contrast semi-saturation values ( wc ) is modeled as power-function decay; the scatter in spatial position ( wx ) is modeled with a normal distribution; and the scatter in orientation tuning ( wx ) is modeled with a von Mises distribution:wc ( C50 ) =1Kc1c50p50 wx ( x0 ) =1Kxexp⟮−12 ( x0σx0 ) 2⟯ wθ ( θ0 ) =1Kθexp ( κθcos ( θ0 ) ) where p50 controls semi-saturation contrast scatter , σx0 controls spatial scatter , κθ controls the orientation scatter , Kc , Kx , Kθ are constants normalizing the weights so that they sum to 1 . 0 . The pooled response is a weighted sum of individual neural responses . For membrane potential:Pc=∑C50wc ( C50 ) Lc ( C50 ) Px=∑x0wxLx ( x0 ) Pθ=∑θ0wθ ( θ0 ) Lθ ( θ0 ) Similar equations for the pooled spiking response are obtained by replacing Lc , Lx and Lθ with Rc , Rx and Rθ . Single neuron parameters were set to typical values reported in the literature ( see Table 1 ) . At present , there is insufficient evidence in the literature to set the values for the spatial dispersion in preferred position and orientation . Thus , these two parameters , σx0 and κθ , were the only two allowed to vary in the model and were estimated by least squares ( Figure 8 ) ."}

The peptidisc method is rapid and cost-effective , and it may emerge as a universal tool for high-throughput stabilization of membrane proteins to advance modern biological studies .", "plain language summary": "Surrounding every living cell is a biological membrane that is largely impermeable to water-soluble molecules . This hydrophobic ( or “water-hating” ) barrier preserves the contents of the cell and also regulates how the cell interacts with its environment . This latter function is critical and relies on a class of proteins that are embedded within the membrane and are also hydrophobic . The hydrophobic nature of membrane proteins is however inconvenient for biochemical studies which usually take place in water-based solutions . Therefore , membrane proteins are under-represented in biological research compared to the water-soluble ones , even though roughly one quarter of a cell’s proteins are membrane proteins . Researchers have developed a few tricks to keep membrane proteins soluble after they have been extracted from the membrane . An old but popular technique makes use of detergents , which are chemicals with opposing hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties ( hydrophilic literally means “water-loving” ) . However , even mild detergents can damage membrane proteins and will sometimes lead to experimental artifacts . More recent tricks to stabilize membrane proteins without detergents have been described but remain laborious , costly or difficult to perform . To overcome these limitations , Carlson et al . developed a simple method to stabilize membrane proteins without detergent . Called the “peptidisc” , the method uses multiple copies of a unique peptide – a short sequence of the building blocks of protein – that had been redesigned to have optimal hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties . The idea was that the peptides would wrap around the hydrophobic parts of the membrane protein , and shield them from the watery solution . Indeed , when Carlson et al . mixed this peptide with five different membrane proteins from bacteria , all were perfectly soluble and functional without detergent . The ideal ratio of peptide needed to form a peptidisc around each membrane protein was reached automatically , without having to test many different conditions . This indicates that the peptidisc acts like a “one size fits all” scaffold . The peptidisc is a new tool that will allow more researchers , including those who are not expert biochemists , to study membrane proteins . This will yield a better understanding of the structure of a cell’s membrane and how it interacts with the environment . Since the approach is both simple and easy to apply , more membrane proteins can now also be included in high-throughput searches for potential new drugs for various medical conditions .", "article": "1 Introduction Membrane proteins play essential roles , such as membrane transport , signal transduction , cell homeostasis , and energy metabolism . Despite their importance , obtaining these proteins in a stable non-aggregated state remains problematic . Membrane proteins are generally purified in detergent micelles , but these small amphipathic molecules are quite often detrimental to protein structure and activity , in addition to interfering with downstream analytical methods . This drawback has led researchers to develop detergent-free alternatives such as amphipols ( Popot , 2010 ) , SMALPs ( Lee et al . , 2016 ) , saposin-lipoparticles ( Frauenfeld et al . , 2016 ) , and the popular nanodisc system ( Bayburt et al . , 2006; Denisov et al . , 2004 ) . In the latter case , two amphipathic membrane scaffold proteins ( MSPs ) derived from apoA1 wrap around a small patch of lipid bilayer containing the target membrane protein ( Bayburt et al . , 2006; Denisov et al . , 2004; Denisov and Sligar , 2016 ) . However , in spite of an apparent simplicity , the formation of a nanodisc depends on several factors such as lipid to protein ratio , scaffold length , nature of lipids , rate of detergent removal and overall amenability of the target for re-assembly into lipid bilayer ( Bayburt et al . , 2006; Denisov et al . , 2004; Hagn et al . , 2013 ) . The method is therefore not trivial and small deviations from optimal conditions often leads to low-efficiency reconstitution , or else liposome formation or protein aggregation ( Bayburt et al . , 2006 ) . Peptides have been considered as an alternative to scaffold proteins . Peptergents ( Corin et al . , 2011 ) , lipopeptides ( Tao et al . , 2013 ) , nanostructured [beta]-sheet peptides ( Privé , 2009 ) , and bi-helical derivatives of the ApoA1-mimetic 18A peptide , termed ‘beltides’ ( Larsen et al . , 2016 ) , have been reported in the recent years . Yet , these systems have not been widely adopted for structural or functional characterization of membrane proteins for various reasons . Peptergents and lipopeptides can solubilize membrane proteins directly from a lipid bilayer , but same as detergent these peptides form mixed micelles that readily aggregate and precipitate below a certain critical micellar concentration ( Corin et al . , 2011; Tao et al . , 2013 ) . Beltides were shown to trap bacteriorhodopsin in solution , but the method required prior incubation with specific amounts of lipids and the particles formed were reportedly unstable at physiological temperatures ( Larsen et al . , 2016 ) . Cost and complexity of the peptide can also be problematic . Nanostructured [beta]-sheet peptides contain extended alkyl chains covalently linked to glycine residues , while lipopeptides need to be covalently linked to a lipid molecule ( Tao et al . , 2013; Privé , 2009 ) . These hydrophobic peptides are also difficult to work with given their low solubility . Peptergents require titration of base to become soluble in aqueous solution ( Corin et al . , 2011 ) , and [beta]-sheet peptides can form extended filament clusters without detergent ( Privé , 2009 ) . Thus , a peptide-based reconstitution method that is cost-effective , rapid , unhindered by issues of solubility and generally applicable to membrane proteins remains to be developped . We present the peptidisc . The peptidisc is made by multiple copies of an amphipathic bi-helical peptide ( hereafter termed NSPr ) wrapping around its target membrane protein . In contrast to the nanodisc , no additional lipids are necessary during reconstitution , except those that have co-purified with the protein ( i . e . annular lipids ) . The peptide design we employ is a reverse version of the original nanodisc scaffold peptide ( NSP ) , which consists of two repeats of the ApoA1-derived 18A peptide joined by a flexible linker proline ( Kariyazono et al . , 2016; Chung et al . , 1985 ) , in addition to two leucine residues which are substituted by phenylalanines to increase lipid affinity ( Kariyazono et al . , 2016; Mishra et al . , 2008 ) ( Supplementary file 1 ) . The original NSP can stabilize lipid particles ( Kariyazono et al . , 2016 ) , but issues of water-solubility and adaptability to membrane proteins were not demonstrated . We show here the NSPr design is very effective for stabilizing both α-helical and β-barrel membrane proteins of different size , topology , and complexity . 2 Results The original NSP is able to capture lipids from a lipid bilayer and forms discoidal particles of varying size ( Kariyazono et al . , 2016 ) . However , due to its hydrophobicity , the NSP peptide is difficult to solubilize; the solution is cloudy after resuspension in water ( Figure 1B ) . To increase peptide solubility , we reversed the amino acid sequence of NSP , so that the two amphipathic helices have a slightly altered orientation , leading to a lower hydrophobic moment and higher overall electropotential ( Figure 1AC , Supplementary file 1 ) . We also forewent acetylation and amidation of the peptide termini so that modifications such biotinylation remain possible . These small modifications allowed the final design ( termed NSPr ) to be fully dissolved in water at concentrations up to 25 mg/ml ( Figure 1B ) . We tested the ability of NSPr to capture the ABC transporter MalFGK2 using an ‘on-column’ reconstitution method ( Figure 2 ) . The NSPr peptide was mixed with MalFGK2 in dodecyl maltoside and the mixture applied immediately onto a size exclusion column equilibrated in a detergent-free buffer ( Figure 2A ) . The collected particles ( hereafter termed peptidisc or MalFGK2-NSPr ) were soluble and monodisperse , as shown by clear-native CN-PAGE and blue-native BN-PAGE ( Figure 2B ) . We determined the approximate peptide content using SDS-PAGE ( Figure 3A ) . Also , since annular lipids are tightly bound to membrane proteins ( Bechara et al . , 2015 ) , we determined the final lipid content in the peptidisc using thin layer chromatography and photocolorimetric methods ( Figure 4A and B ) . This analysis indicated a stoichiometry of 10 ± 2 peptides and 41 ± 10 lipids per MalFGK2 ( Table 1 ) . This stoichiometry allowed us to calculate the mass of the MalFGK2 peptidisc to 251 ± 12 kDa ( Table 1 ) . Interestingly , the lipids identified in the TLC analysis were predominantly negative phospholipids , cardiolipin and phosphatidylglycerol ( Figure 4B ) . These lipids play a role in regulation of MalFGK2 by stabilizing interactions with the regulatory protein EIIA ( Bao and Duong , 2013 ) . To corroborate the peptide and lipid stoichiometry , we determined the molecular weight of the intact complex by native mass spectrometry ( 247 ± 24 kDa; Table 1 , Figure 5A and B ) , and size exclusion chromatography coupled multi-angle light scattering ( SEC-MALS ) ( 250 ± 17 kDa; Table 2 , Figure 6A ) . The SEC-MALS analysis showed that the peptidisc remains perfectly stable during storage ( e . g . 3 days at 4°C ) . We then examined the particles by single particle negative-stain electron microscopy ( Figure 2C ) . The 2D-class averages revealed a structure very similar to MalFGK2 in nanodiscs , ( Fabre et al . , 2017 ) with distinctly visible elements such as the MalK2 dimer , the periplasmic P2 loop and a larger discoidal density corresponding to the NSPr peptides wrapping around the MalFG membrane domain . The measured diameter of the peptidisc was 11 . 7 ± 1 . 4 nm , which is consistent with a stoichiometry of 12 ± 2 peptides per MalFGK2 complex when arranged in the double-belt model ( Table 2 ) . Finally , the ATPase activity of MalFGK2 in peptidisc was similar to that reported in proteoliposomes and in nanodiscs ( Bao and Duong , 2012 ) , in sharp contrast to the high and unregulated ATPase activity observed in detergent micelles ( Figure 2D ) . Importantly , the structural integrity of the peptidisc remained stable at elevated temperatures , with ~80% of MalFGK2 peptidisc intact after incubation for 3 hr at 30°C ( Figure 6B ) . We also incorporated β-barrel membrane proteins in peptidisc , using the FhuA receptor as a model protein ( Figure 7A ) . Analysis of FhuA-peptidisc by native mass spectrometry indicated a molecular weight of 138 ± 17 kDa ( Figure 5E and F ) . Quantitation of the individual peptide and lipid components , following the approach applied to MalFGK2 above , indicated an average of 8 ± 3 lipids and 10 ± 2 NSPr per FhuA ( Table 1 , Figure 3B and Figure 4A ) . These measurements were used to estimate a molecular mass of 131 ± 9 kDa ( Table 1 ) . Binding analysis on CN-PAGE further showed that FhuA in peptidisc is functional for both TonB and colicin M ( Figure 7B ) . The binding of TonB and colicin M is modulated by the ligand ferricrocin ( Figure 7B ) , as previously reported in vivo and in vitro ( Mills et al . , 2014; Wayne et al . , 1976 ) . The peptidisc is therefore suitable for the functional reconstitution of both α-helical and β-barrel membrane proteins . The ‘in-gel’ method ( Figure 8 ) was developed to determine optimal reconstitution conditions in a time- and cost-effective manner . Small amounts of peptides ( 0–2 . 5 µg ) were mixed with the target protein ( ~1 . 25 µg ) in detergent solution , and the resulting mixture immediately loaded on native gel . In that case , removal of the non-ionic detergent occurs during electrophoresis when the protein-peptide mixture enters the detergent-free part of the gel . At the correct NSP ratio , the target membrane protein does not aggregate at the top of the gel but instead migrates in a soluble form to its expected molecular weight position . This simple method allowed us to estimate the effective NSP concentrations required to trap four different integral membrane complexes into a peptidisc: MalFGK2 ( Figure 8A ) , FhuA ( Figure 8B ) , the trimeric OmpF porin ( Figure 8C ) , and the membrane translocon SecYEG ( Figure 8D ) . These membrane proteins were generally reconstituted at similar peptide concentrations , with a half-maximal molar ratio ( RR50 ) of 20 ( Figure 8E and F ) . This is significantly higher than the measured stoichiometry of ~10 peptides per protein complex ( Table 1 ) , suggesting that excess peptide is needed to achieve efficient assembly . This analysis also showed that the SecYEG complex can be trapped as a dimer and higher order oligomeric form in peptidisc ( Figure 8D ) , probably due to the self-association of this complex in detergent solution , as shown before ( Bessonneau et al . , 2002 ) . This later observation further differentiates the peptidisc from the nanodisc . In the nanodisc , the selective reconstitution of the SecYEG monomer and dimer requires MSP proteins of different lengths ( Figure 8—figure supplement 1 ) ( Dalal et al . , 2012 ) . To save on peptide consumption , as well as to minimize exposure of the target to detergent , we developed the ‘on-beads’ reconstitution method ( Figure 9 ) , wherein affinity-purification of the protein and incorporation into peptidisc are carried out simultaneously . As illustrated in Figure 9A , the peptide was added in excess while the membrane protein still bound to the beads , followed by detergent dilution and eventually elution in a detergent-free buffer ( Figure 9A , step 5 ) . The method was tested using the his-tagged MalFGK2 complex ( Figure 9B ) . Analysis of the eluted complex by BN-PAGE and CN-PAGE showed that MalFGK2 is readily incorporated into peptidiscs ( Figure 9C ) , with purity and yield as good as with conventional detergent-based chromatography ( Figure 9C ) . As an added advantage , the excess peptide collected before the elution step was re-used for the next round of ‘on-beads’ reconstitution , thereby reducing the cost of large-scale reconstitution . Finally , we reconstituted the photosynthetic bacterial reaction center ( BRC ) from Rhodobacter sphaeroides , given its potential for biotechnological application . The BRC is employed in bio-hybrid solar cells due to its ability to absorb light in the near-infrared with high quantum efficiency ( Blankenship et al . , 2011; Ravi and Tan , 2015; Yaghoubi et al . , 2017 ) . However , sustained heat and light exposure lead to irreversible loss of pigments and protein denaturation ( Hughes et al . , 2006; Scheidelaar S et al . , 2014 ) . Thermal stability and solubility at high protein concentration are therefore important parameters for successful application . The molecular weight of the BRC peptidisc measured by native mass spectrometry is 138 ± 18 kDa ( Table 1 , Figure 5C and D ) . It has been shown that purification of BRC in LDAO delipidates the complex ( Scheidelaar S et al . , 2014 ) , and accordingly the BRC peptidisc contained only 4 ± 1 phospholipids ( Table 1 , Figure 4A ) . Analysis by SDS-PAGE indicated a stoichiometry of 9 ± 1 NSP per BRC ( Table 1 , Figure 3C ) . The calculated molecular weight was 138 ± 5 kDa , in excellent agreement with native mass spectrometry data ( Table 1 ) . We next measured the stability of the BRC pigments in peptidiscs or in LDAO detergent ( Figure 10—figure supplement 1A and B ) . The spectral properties of the BRC complex were similar in both environments ( Figure 10A ) . However , the BRC in peptidisc resisted denaturation 65°C for 1 hr , while it was fully denatured in less than 4 min in LDAO ( Figure 10B ) . This difference corresponds to ~100 fold increase of the half-life of the BRC complex at elevated temperatures ( Figure 10C ) . We also compared the thermal stability of the BRC complex when reconstituted without additional lipids in SMA polymer and nanodiscs ( Figure 10—figure supplement 1C and D ) . Without added lipid , the diameter of the BRC is too small for the MSP1D1 belt , resulting in some protein aggregation and heterogenous nanodisc preparation ( Figure 10—figure supplement 1F , left panel , lane 4 ) . Reconstitution into the SMA polymer without lipids was monodisperse ( Figure 10—figure supplement 1F , left panel , lane 5 ) and the thermostability was higher than in LDAO ( Figure 10—figure supplement 1E ) . This observation is contrary to previous reports which suggest that the lipid environment in the SMA particle is what increases BRC thermostability . ( Scheidelaar S et al . , 2014 ) In our hands , reconstitution of the BRC into peptidiscs , proteoliposomes , low-lipid nanodiscs and SMA particles all result in comparable thermostability ( Figure 10—figure supplement 1E ) . From these results , it appears more important to remove detergents than include lipids to increase thermal tolerance of the BRC . 3 Discussion Detergents remain the most effective way to extract and purify membrane proteins , yet these surfactants have many undesired effects on protein stability and downstream biochemical analysis . To circumvent these difficulties , and to handle these proteins like their water-soluble counterparts , membrane proteins are more often reconstituted with amphipathic scaffolds . However , current methods of reconstitution are difficult because each scaffold system has specific properties and limitations , and each requires substantial optimization . The aim of our work was to develop a ‘one-size fits all’ method to streamline the capture of membrane proteins in detergent-free solution . We show that the peptidisc is a simple and efficient way to replace detergent . The system works with membrane proteins of different size , fold and complexity , and does not require addition of exogenous lipids . The peptidisc captures membrane proteins regardless of their initial lipid content , and therefore the use of exogenous lipids to match the diameter of the scaffold such as in the nanodisc system is avoided . Since the binding of the peptide is essentially guided by the size and shape of the protein template , the peptide stoichiometry is also self-determined . As a direct consequence , the preparation of peptidisc is possible through rapid detergent removal techniques such as ‘in-gel’ , ‘on-column’ and ‘on-bead’ methods . Each of these methods has considerable advantages compared to overnight dialysis and ‘biobeads’ techniques traditionally used for scaffold reconstitution . The ‘in-gel’ method is fast , high throughput and requires only 1–2 µg of the precious target protein in order to identify the optimal peptide ratio ( Figure 8 ) . The ‘on-column’ method allows direct preparation of large quantities of peptidiscs with simultaneous removal of salts , detergent and excess peptides . However , gel filtration requires concentrated protein samples and unbound peptide is wasted . The ‘on-bead’ method is therefore ideal for the peptidisc reconstitution because protein purification , detergent removal , trapping in peptidisc and recovering of unbound peptide are carried out simultaneously in the same tube . Additionally , because long exposure or storage of the protein in detergent is avoided , the ‘on-bead’ method can be especially advantageous in the case of unstable membrane proteins . Beside these methodological considerations , we show that the peptidisc maintain proteins in a functional state . For instance , both FhuA and MalFGK2 retain their ability to interact with their soluble binding partners . In contrast to the detergent , the ATPase activity of MalFGK2 in peptidisc regains dependence to substrate and maltose-binding protein MalE , indicating a return to the transporter’s native membrane conformation ( Bao and Duong , 2012 ) . Negative-stain electron microscopy of MalFGK2 shows good resolution for the periplasmic P2 loop and cytosolic ABC domains , whereas the transmembrane domains MalFG are surrounded by an extra density corresponding to the peptide belt and naturally present lipids ( Figure 2C ) . Lipid quantitation indeed indicates that ~ 40 lipids molecules , mostly acidic , are captured with MalFGK2 ( Table 1 , Figure 4A ) . In the case of the BRC complex however , there must be direct protein-peptide contact because almost no lipids are detected in the final assembly ( Table 1 , Figure 4A and B ) . Despite the absence of lipids , the thermal stability of the BRC in peptidisc is still much higher than in detergent , with a melting temperature similar to that observed proteoliposomes ( Figure 10—figure supplement 1E ) . Clearly , the peptidisc is more than a simple surrogate of the detergent molecules; the peptide assembly forms an environment that stabilize and support the transmembrane domains of a membrane protein from aqueous solution . The peptidisc offers distinct advantages when compared to other amphipathic scaffolds . Unlike beltides , peptergents , lipopeptides , and nanostructured [beta]-sheet peptides , the NSPr does not require modifications at its N- or C-termini ( Corin et al . , 2011; Tao et al . , 2013; Privé , 2009; Larsen et al . , 2016 ) . Both ends of NSPr remain available for modifications , such as biotinylation , which we show does not affect peptidisc assembly ( Figure 3B ) . Importantly , peptergents and lipopeptides have critical micelle concentrations and dynamically exchange in solution . Because of this instability , an excess of these peptides is always needed to keep membrane proteins in solution ( Corin et al . , 2011; McGregor et al . , 2003 ) . This is not the case for the peptidisc because NSPr binds strongly to its target , allowing free peptides to be removed without compromising peptidisc stability . The length of the NSPr also does not need to be adjusted to the diameter of the target protein . This property may be especially advantageous when capturing macromolecular membrane protein complexes or proteins that exist in oligomeric state , as is the case with the SecYEG complex ( Figure 8—figure supplement 1B ) . Lastly , the NSPr is synthetically made and can be obtained in large quantity , high purity and free of immunogens usually found in recombinant cell expression systems ( Schwarz et al . , 2014 ) . The structural homogeneity of NSPr is also high compared to other synthetic scaffolds , such as amphipols and styrene-maleic acids ( SMA ) . This is because peptide synthesis is sequential , whereas addition of carboxylate and other repeating units in amphipols and industrially prepared SMA polymers is randomly distributed along the polymer chain during assembly . Due to the ‘one-pot’ synthesis , these synthetic polymer preparations are often polydisperse mixtures of different lengths ( Popot , 2010; Smith et al . , 2017 ) . This compositional heterogeneity can be problematic for functional and structural studies ( Deller et al . , 2016 ) . Finally , due to both positive and negative charged amino acids , the solubility of the NSPr remains high at various pH or with divalent cations . Both these conditions can destabilize assemblies formed by synthetic polymers because they largely depend on charged carboxylate groups for solubility ( Popot , 2010; Gulati et al . , 2014 ) . How exactly the peptidisc wraps around the membrane protein template remains an important question . In ApoA1 lipid nanodiscs , the two scaffold proteins arrange themselves in an anti-parallel ‘double belt’ configuration ( Bibow et al . , 2017 ) . If NSPr were also arranged in a double belt , then the peptide to protein ratio would expectedly vary by factor of 2 , as an odd number of scaffold would leave part of the protein exposed to the environment . However , the native mass spectrometry profiles for FhuA and BRC indicate peptidisc populations which can differ in mass by one peptide only ( Figure 5D and F ) , suggesting an arrangement that is flexible . Possibly , the NSPr could be arranged in an orthogonal ‘picket fence’ orientation as proposed for lipopeptides , nanostructured [beta]-sheet peptides , and single helix ApoA1 mimetic peptides . ( Tao et al . , 2013; Privé , 2009; Islam et al . , 2018 ) . However , the length of NSPr ( 37 amino acids ) is too long to be orthogonal while maintaining contact with hydrophobic parts of the protein or alkyl chains of annular lipids . Thus , the NSPr perhaps simply lies in a tilted orientation . A tilted orientation would facilitate optimal binding and stoichiometry as the peptide shifts in angle of association , adapting to best fit the target membrane protein template . In conclusion , the peptidisc offers several advantages . The method is cheap , fast and seamlessly integrated in existing protein purification protocols , such as size exclusion and affinity chromatography . The peptide is relatively simple to synthesize and it can be recycled via the ‘on-bead’ method to decrease consumption . The peptidisc is not hindered by issue of buffer instability or heterogeneity as observed with other synthetic scaffold . Since the peptide self-associates to its template and without added lipids , this could be advantageous for structural studies which are affected by compositional heterogeneity . There are of course applications where other scaffold systems are better suited , such as direct protein solubilization with SMA polymers , or control over lipid environment offered by nanodiscs . Nevertheless , the current advantages of the peptidisc surely diminish the challenges associated with biochemical , structural and pharmacological characterization of purified membrane proteins . The peptidisc may emerge as a very practical way to analyse or exploit membrane proteins in a detergent-free environment . 4 Materials and methods Tryptone , yeast extract , NaCl , imidazole , Tris-base , acrylamide 40% , bis-acrylamide 2% and TEMED were obtained from Bioshop , Canada .

Ltd . and Genscript ( each with purity >80% ) . Peptide NSPrbio was obtained from KareBay . The effective purity of the peptides employed is actually higher as mass spectrometry analysis finds that main contaminants ( >10% ) consists of peptides missing the final aspartate residue . To aid accessibility to the academic community , bulk NSPr peptides and core protocols are available at www . peptidisc . com For solubility test experiments , lyophilized NSP and NSPr ( purity of 82% and 85% , respectively ) were resuspended in dH20 at room temperature to final concentrations of 15 mg/mL and 25 mg/mL , respectively . Peptide concentration was determined by absorbance at 280 nm . Residual TFA from peptide synthesis results in a low pH solution ( pH 2–3 ) . For all other experiments , peptides were solubilized in dH2O at 6 mg/mL . Solubilized peptides were stored at 4°C for up to 5 weeks . Immediately before use , the pH of the peptide solution was modified by addition of 20 mM Tris-HCl , pH 8 to form the so-called Assembly Buffer . Immediately before use in peptidisc reconstitutions , peptide concentration in Assembly Buffer was verified by Bradford assay ( Prehna et al . , 2012 ) .

The outer membrane fraction ( OM ) was isolated by ultracentrifugation , resuspended in Buffer A + 1% LDAO at a concentration of 3 mg/mL , and incubated overnight at 4°C with gentle rocking . Insoluble material was removed by an additional ultracentrifugation step , and the clarified lysate was applied onto a Resource 15Q column pre-equilibriated in Buffer EQ + 0 . 1% LDAO .

After extensive washing in Buffer A + 0 . 02% DDM , SecYEG was eluted in Buffer A + 0 . 02% DDM over a 20 mL gradient of 0–600 mM imidazole . The most concentrated fractions were pooled and diluted fivefold in Buffer O ( 50 mM Tris-HCl: pH 8 , 10% glycerol +0 . 02% DDM ) before being applied to a 5 mL Fast Flow S cation exchange column pre-equilibrated in Buffer EQ + 0 . 02% DDM . Bound protein was eluted over a 20 mL gradient from 50 to 600 mM NaCl in Buffer EQ + 0 . 02% DDM . Plasmids pET28 encoding his-tagged MSPD1 and MSP1D1E3 proteins were transformed into BL21 cells and protein expression and purification was performed as previously described ( Dalal et al . , 2012 ) . All proteins , with the exception of BRC , were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately after purification and stored at −80°C for later use . BRC was purified as previously described ( Bradford , 1976 ) . In brief , His-tagged BRC was expressed in Rhodobacter Sphaeroides RcX ( ΔpuhA , ΔpufQBALMX , ΔrshI , ΔppsR ) using plasmid pIND4-RC1 . A preculture of 10 mL in RLB media ( LB medium; 810 µM MgCl2; 510 µM CaCl2 ) +25 µg/mL kanamycin was transferred into 100 ml of RLB-kan and grown overnight at 30°C before transfer into 1 L of freshly prepared RLB-kan . After growth for 8 hr at 30°C , BRC production was induced with 1 mM IPTG for an additional 16 hr . During growth and purification , light exposure was kept to a minimum . Cells were harvested by low-speed centrifugation , resuspended in Buffer A and lysed by French press ( 10 , 000 psi ) . Unbroken cells and cell debris were removed by low speed centrifugation , and the supernatant treated with 1% LDAO overnight at 4°C . After removal of insoluble material by ultracentrifugation , the supernatant was supplemented with 10 mM imidazole and the BRC purified by Ni2+-chelating affinity chromatography . BRC bound to affinity resin was washed overnight at 4°C in 20 column volumes of Buffer B + 0 . 03% LDAO , before elution in Buffer C + 0 . 03% LDAO . The complex was further purified on a Superdex 200 HR 10/300 GL in Buffer A + 0 . 03% LDAO , and stored in the dark at 4°C before use in thermostability assays . MalFGK2 ( 300 µg ) in Buffer E + 0 . 02% DDM was mixed with NSP ( 480 µg ) in Assembly Buffer in a total volume of 100 µL . The mixture was immediately injected onto a 100 µL loop connected to a Superdex 200 HR 5/200 GL column running at 0 . 4 ml/min in Buffer AC ( 50 mM Tris-HCl , pH 8; 100 mM NaCl ) . Fractions were collected , pooled , concentrated using a 100 kDa polysulfone filter ( Pall Corporation , USA ) , and stored at 4°C . For on-column reconstitution of FhuA , 500 µL of the protein ( 1 mg ) was mixed with NSP ( 1 . 8 mg ) in Buffer A + 0 . 05% LDAO , and injected onto a 500 µL loop connected to a Superdex 200 HR 10/300 GL column running at 0 . 5 mL/min in Buffer AC . The target membrane protein ( ~1 . 25 µg ) was mixed with increasing concentrations of NSPr ( 0–2 . 5 µg ) and allowed to incubate for 1–2 min at room temperature . The mixture was then supplemented with Buffer A to bring the final detergent concentration below its CMC ( 0 . 008% and 0 . 01% for DDM and LDAO , respectively ) while keeping the final volume to 15 µL . A solution of glycerol was added to 10% final to facilitate loading on 4–12% CN-PAGE . The electrophoresis was set constant at 25mA for 1 hr at room temperature . Bands were visualized by Coomassie Blue G250 staining . Crude membranes ( 10 mL at 7 . 5 mg/ml total protein content ) containing overexpressed MalFGK2 were solubilized in Buffer A + 1% DDM for 1 hr at 4°C before removal of insoluble aggregate by ultracentrifugation ( 100 , 000 x g , 1 hr , 4°C ) . The solubilized membrane proteins were incubated with 200 µl of Ni-NTA resin ( Qiagen ) pre-equilibriated in Buffer A + 0 . 02% DDM for 1 hr at 4°C . The Ni-NTA beads were collected by low-speed centrifugation ( 3000 x g , 3 min ) , washed twice with 10 CV of Buffer B supplemented with 0 . 02% DDM . Post-washing , 10 CV of Assembly Buffer ( 1 mg/mL NSPr in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8 ) was added to the beads and allowed to incubate for 5 min on ice . The Assembly Buffer was removed and the beads loaded into a gravity column with 10 CV of Buffer B ( 50 mM Tris-HCl , pH 8; 200 mM NaCl , 10% glycerol , 15 mM imidazole ) . The assembled peptidiscs were subsequently treated with 500 µL of Buffer C ( 50 mM Tris-HCl , pH 8; 100 mM NaCl;10% glycerol; 400 mM imidazole ) to elute the peptidisc from the affinity resin . The same procedure was done in parallel , except the NSPr was omitted from the Assembly Buffer and 0 . 02% DDM was included in Buffer A , B , and C . The purified BRC complex ( 1 mg/mL ) was mixed at a 1:1 . 8 ( µg/µg ) ratio with NSPr followed by 10-fold dilution in Buffer A to decrease the LDAO concentration to 0 . 003% . For formation of low-lipid nanodiscs , the purified BRC complex was instead mixed at a 1:2 ( mol/mol ) ratio with MSP1D1 before dilution . Alternatively , an equivalent amount of BRC was diluted in Buffer A supplemented with 0 . 03% LDAO , 0 . 02% DDM , 0 . 1% SMA or 0 . 1% SDS as described . After incubation for 10 min on ice , aggregated proteins were removed by centrifugation ( 13 , 000 x g , 10 min at 4°C ) . Peptidisc formation was confirmed by analysis on CN-PAGE . Proteoliposomes were prepared at a molar protein:lipid ratio of 1:2000 . Total E . coli lipids were dissolved in chloroform , dried under nitrogen and resuspended in Buffer A + 0 . 8% β-OG . Purified MalFGK2 was added to the solubilized lipids , and the detergent was removed by overnight incubation at 4°C with Amberlite XAD-2 adsorbent beads ( Supelco ) . The proteoliposomes were isolated by ultracentrifugation ( 100 , 000 × g , 60 min at 4°C ) and resuspended in 20 mM Tris–HCl , pH 8 before use in ATPase assays . The same procedure was employed for the BRC , but a lipid mixture of DOPC:DOPG ( 80:20 mol/mol ) was utilized in place of total E . coli lipids . Equal volumes of 4% and 12% acrylamide solutions were prepared in advance ( Supplementary file 2 ) . Linear gradient gels were formed by gradual mixing of the two solutions ( 35 mL each ) at a flow rate of 2 ml/min using a 100 mL gradient mixer ( Sigma ) . The cross-linking agents , TEMED and ammonium persulfate , were added immediately before gradient mixing . Once poured , plastic wells ( Biorad ) were inserted and gels allowed to cure for 90 min before storage at 4°C . For clear-native PAGE , anode and cathode buffers consisted of Buffer N ( 37 mM Tris-HCl; 35 mM Glycine; pH 8 . 8 ) . For blue-native PAGE , anode buffer consisted of Buffer N + 180 µM Coomassie Blue G-250 , and cathode buffer contained Buffer N only . Aliquots of MalFGK2-NSPr were analyzed by static light scattering . Static light scattering analysis were performed using a WTC-050S5 column ( Wyatt Technologies ) connected to a miniDAWN light scattering detector and interferometry refractometer ( Wyatt Technologies ) .

Freshly prepared 1 . 5% uranyl formate ( pH 5 ) was added ( 5 µl ) for 1 min and then blotted . Around 200 digital micrographs were collected using a FEI Tecnai G2 F20 microscope operated at 200 kV and equipped with a Gatan Ultrascan 4k × 4 k Digital CCD Camera . The images were recorded at defocus between 0 . 7 and 1 . 4 µm at a magnification of 67 , 000X at the camera and a pixel size of 2 . 24 Å . Contrast transfer function parameters were determined using CTFFIND3 ( Mindell and Grigorieff , 2003 ) . We selected 31188 protein particles using e2boxer from the EMAN2 software suite ( Tang et al . , 2007 ) and extracted with a box size of 96 × 96 pixels . Particles were classified using a likelihood 2D classification with 16 seeds with the RELION-1 . 3 software suite ( Scheres , 2012 ) . A 2D variance of particles contained in side view ( 3175 particles ) was computed with SPARX to estimate the peptidisc diameter variation ( Hohn et al . , 2007 ) . The measurements were done using e2display from the EMAN2 software suite ( Corin et al . , 2011 ) on the side views shown in Figure 2C . FhuA-MSPL156 nanodiscs were prepared as previously described ( Lee et al . , 2016 ) . FhuA-NSPr was prepared by on-column peptidisc reconstitution . About 2 µg of FhuA reconstituted into either MSPL156 or NSPr was incubated with TonB23-329 ( 2 µg ) or ColM ( 5 µg ) in the presence or absence of ferricrocin for 5 min at room temperature . The protein complexes were separated by CN-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie blue staining . Neither monomeric TonB nor ColM migrate on CN-PAGE due to their isoelectric points > pH 8 . 8 . BRC peptidisc , MalFGK2 peptidisc , and FhuA peptidisc were prepared by ‘on-column’ reconstitution in 100 mM ammonium acetate , pH 7 . 0 at protein to NSPr ( g/g ) ratios of 1:1 . 8 , 1:1 . 6 , and 1:1 . 8 , respectively . Mass spectrometry measurements were performed in positive ion mode on a Synapt G2S quadrupole-ion mobility separation-time-of-flight ( Q-IMS-TOF ) mass spectrometer ( Waters , Manchester , UK ) with a nanoflow electrospray ionization ESI ( nanoESI ) source . Borosilicate capillaries ( 1 . 0 mm o . d . , 0 . 68 mm i . d . ) were pulled in-house using a P-1000 micropipette puller ( Sutter Instruments , Novato , CA ) . A voltage of ~1 . 0 kV was applied to a platinum wire was inserted into the nanoESI tip . A source temperature of 60°C and a Cone voltage of 30 V were used . Argon was used in the Trap and Transfer ion guides , at pressures of 2 . 77 × 10−2 mbar and 2 . 84 × 10−2 mbar , respectively , and the Trap and Transfer voltages were 5 V and 2 V , respectively . All data were processed using MassLynx software ( v4 . 1 ) . Spectral deconvolution was performed with the UniDec ( Marty et al . , 2015 ) deconvolution algorithm using the following parameters: m/z range – 7000 to 9500 ( MalFGK2 peptidisc ) , 5500 to 9000 ( BRC peptidisc ) , 5000 to 10000 ( FhuA peptidisc ) ; Subtract minimum - 50 . 0; Gaussian Smoothing - 10 . 0; Bin every 1 . 0; Linear m/z ( constant delta m/z ) ; Charge Range - 20 to 40 ( MalFGK2 peptidisc ) , 10 to 30 ( BRC peptidisc ) , 10 to 30 ( FhuA peptidisc ) ; Mass range - 200 , 000 to 300 , 000 ( MalFGK2 peptidisc ) , 100 , 000 to 180 , 000 ( BRC peptidisc ) , 100 , 000 to 170 , 000 ( FhuA peptidisc ) ; Sample Mass Every 1 . 0 Da; Peak FWHM ( Th ) 4 . 0; Peak Shape Function - Gaussian; Charge Smooth Window - 1 . 0; Mass Difference - 4474 . 0; Mass Smooth Window - 1 . 0; Maximum number of iterations - 1000 . Spectral files were loaded as text files containing intensity and m/z values . Absorption spectra were recorded using a Hitachi U-3010 spectrophotometer . A blank measurement was recorded in Buffer A ( +0 . 03% LDAO for detergent purified BRC ) . Samples were incubated in a PCR thermocycler at the indicated temperature , and then measured at the desired time points in a quartz cuvette at room temperature . Spectra were collected between 600 nm and 1100 nm ( scan time ∼20 s ) at intervals of 1 . 5 min . For comparisons of spectra between conditions , spectra were normalized to a value of 1 . 0 at 804 nm . The BRC complex into the indicated detergent or reconstituted into peptidiscs was incubated at varying temperatures in a PCR thermocycler for 5 min , then 3 µL of the mixture dotted onto nitrocellulose paper pre-wetted in Buffer A . The dot blot was imaged using a LICOR odyssey infrared fluorescence scanner ( excitation 680 nm , emission 700 nm ) . Fluorescence intensity was quantified by Image J . The MalFGK2 and BRC peptidiscs were prepared by on-column reconstitution on a Superdex 5/25 column equilibrated in Buffer A , followed by one additional gel filtration step to ensure full removal of free NSPr . MalFGK2 ( 1 µg ) , FhuA ( 2 µg ) , and BRC ( 2 µg ) peptidiscs were analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE . Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue G-250 , and destained overnight before fluorescence measurement ( excitation 680 nm , emission 700 nm ) on a LICOR Odyssey scanner . The band corresponding to the NSPr peptide was quantified by densitometry using Image J and compared to a standard curve of NSPr ( 0–2 µg ) loaded on the same gel . The determined NSPr amount was then subtracted from the total amount of protein loaded on the gel to determine the amount of reconstituted membrane protein in the peptidisc . Membrane protein content in peptidisc ( g ) = total protein in peptidisc ( g ) - measured NSPr content ( g ) . We used these calculated mass measurements and the molecular weight ( MW ) for NSPr ( 4 . 5 kDa ) , MalFGK2 ( 173 kDa ) , FhuA ( 80 kDa ) and BRC ( 94 kDa ) to calculate NSPr stoichiometry as follows;NSPrStoichiometry=MWMembraneprotein ( g/mol ) MWNSPr ( g/mol ) ×MeasuredNSPrcontent ( g ) Membraneproteincontentinpeptidisc ( g ) Each experiment was repeated in triplicate on three different gels . We note that detergent-purified FhuA co-purified with a contaminant , thought to be short chain lipopolysaccharides , that migrated to the same position as NSPr , therefore FhuA was reconstituted using NSPr labelled with a biotin group ( NSPrbio ) . To quantify NSPrbio , western blots were incubated with streptavidin conjugated to Alexafluor 680 in phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) , followed by several washes in PBS + 0 . 1% Tween . Western blots were imaged on a LICOR Odyssey scanner fluorescence ( excitation 680 nm , emission 700 nm ) , and the bands corresponding to NSPrbio quantified in Image J . The MaFGK2 and BRC peptidiscs were prepared on-bead , and the FhuA peptidisc was prepared on-column . MalFGK2 ( 40 µg ) , FhuA ( 40 µg ) , and BRC ( 80 µg ) peptidiscs were diluted to a final volume of 200 µL of Buffer A , then mixed with 800 µL of a 2:1 solution of methanol:chloroform for 10 min at 25°C in glass screw cap vials . 200 µL of chloroform and 200 µL of distilled water were added sequentially , vortexed briefly , and the resulting two phase system separated by low-speed centrifugation ( 3000 r . p . m . , 10 min ) . The organic phase was dried under nitrogen , and stored at −20°C . Total phosphate content was determined by a modified version of the malachite green assay ( Lanzetta et al . , 1979 ) . Malachite green reagent was prepared as follows: ammonium molybdate ( 4 . 2 g ) was dissolved in 100 mL of 4M HCl , then mixed with 300 mL malachite green ( 135 mg ) dissolved in distilled water . The solution was mixed for 1 hr at 4°C , filtered , and stored at 4°C before use . Dried lipid extracts were subsequently incubated with 1 mL of 70% perchloric acid for 3 hr at 130°C , and then 20 µL of the resulting solution mixed with 500 µL of the malachite green reagent for 5 min at room temperature before absorbance measurement at 660 nm . Phosphate standards ( KH2PO4 ) were diluted into perchloric acid and used to prepare a standard curve with phosphate concentrations ranging from 0 . 01 nmol to 1 nmol PO4 . For thin layer chromatography ( TLC ) analysis , dried lipids were resuspended in 30 µL of chloroform , and 10 µL were dotted onto a TLC Silica gel 60 ( Millipore ) . The TLC was developed in a solution of 35:25:3:28 chlorofrom:triethylamine:dH2O:ethanol . Plates were dried in an oven for 5 min at 150°C . Lipids were visualized by lightly wetting plates in a solution of 10% Cu2S04 in 8 . 5% phosphoric acid , followed by heating for 5 min at 150°C . The MalFGK2 ATPase activity was determined by monitoring the release of inorganic phosphate using the malachite green method ( Lanzetta et al . , 1979 ) . Protein and peptide concentrations were determined by Bradford assay ( Prehna et al . , 2012 ) . SMA polymer containing 2:1 styrene to maleic acid ratio was prepared following the procedure described by Dörr et al . ( 2014 ) . In brief , 10% of SMA 2000 ( Cray Valley ) , was refluxed for 3 hr at 80°C in 1M KOH , resulting in complete solubilization of the polymer . Polymer was then precipitated by dropwise addition of 6M HCl accompanied by stirring and pelleted by centrifugation ( 1500 x g for 5 min ) . The pellet was then washed 3 times with 50 mL of 25 mM HCl , followed by a third wash in ultrapure water and subsequent lyophilization . Lyophilized SMA was later re-suspended at 10% wt/vol in 25 mM Tris-HCl , and the pH of the solution adjusted to 8 with 1M NaOH . Peptide hydrophobic moment and electropotential was calculated using the 3D-HM calculator ( Reißer et al . , 2014 ) . Sequences corresponding to NSP or NSPr were calculated with the C-terminus specified as ( COO- ) and N-terminus specified as ( NH3+ ) . UV absorbance of solubilized peptides was measured by Nanodrop ."}

Most DNA molecules consist of two single strands of DNA that are held together by hydrogen bonds in the familiar double-helix structure . Of the various types of damage that DNA molecules are prone to , double-strand breaks are among the most dangerous because they can lead to cancer if they are not repaired . DNA molecules use four bases—adenine , cytosine , guanine , and thymine—to store genetic information . In single-stranded DNA these bases are attached to a backbone made of alternating sugar and phosphate groups . A crucial feature of double-stranded DNA is that the sequences of bases in the two strands are complementary to each other—adenine is always paired with thymine , and cytosine is always paired with guanine . However , the hydrogen bonds that hold the pairs of bases together are quite weak , which means that the two strands of the double helix can be pulled apart quite easily . The ease with which these bonds can be formed and broken is crucial for many genetic processes . One way to repair a double strand break is to replace the damaged stretch of DNA with an undamaged stretch from another DNA molecule . This process of swapping DNA molecules , which is called strand exchange , is catalyzed by a protein that is able to interact with two DNA molecules at the same time . An important first step within this process is identifying the stretch of DNA that can be used to repair the break . Ragunathan et al . now report evidence from experiments on Escherichia coli that support a model in which the protein catalyst ( RecA in the case of E . coli ) combines with a single strand of DNA to form a filamentous DNA–protein complex ( RecA filament ) that can then slide along a double-stranded DNA molecule to search for a complementary sequence of base pairs . High-resolution fluorescent imaging reveals that the RecA filament is able to sample several hundred base pairs before the filament dissociates from the DNA and rebinds at a different location . The sliding was largely driven by electrostatic interactions between the RecA filament and the double-stranded DNA , and the filament was capable of identifying matching sequences that contained as few as six matching bases . Ragunathan et al . estimate that sliding is about two orders of magnitude faster at finding matching sequences compared to mechanisms that do not involve sliding , such as models that rely solely on chance encounters between DNA molecules and the RecA filament . By showing that a DNA–protein complex can slide along another DNA molecule to search for a target , these results could lead to new insights into other systems in which it is necessary for protein-nucleic acid complexes to locate a particular sequence of bases .", "article": "1 Introduction The ubiquitous presence of DNA damaging agents poses a constant threat to genome integrity and protein machineries are required to repair DNA damage . Homologous recombination is one of the pathways involved in double strand break repair ( Cox et al . , 2000 ) . An important step in homologous recombination is the reciprocal exchange of basepairs between complementary DNA molecules during a reaction called strand exchange , which is catalyzed by RecA in E . coli . Homologs of RecA , Rad51 and Dmc1 in eukaryotes and RadA in archaea , carry out similar functions during DNA repair underscoring the central role of proteins catalyzing strand exchange across all forms of life ( Bianco et al . , 1998 ) . The strand exchange reaction involves three steps: ( 1 ) pre-synapsis , ( 2 ) synapsis , and ( 3 ) heteroduplex extension via branch migration . Pre-synapsis involves the assembly of RecA monomers on single stranded ( ss ) DNA in the presence of ATP with a stoichiometry of 3 nt per monomer ( Di Capua et al . , 1982; Dombroski et al . , 1983 ) . RecA forms a filament which stretches the ssDNA to a length of 1 . 5 times the length of B-form DNA ( Stasiak et al . , 1981; Dunn et al . , 1982; Stasiak and Egelman , 1986 ) . During synapsis , the RecA filament finds a homologous double stranded ( ds ) DNA and catalyzes the exchange of complementary base pairs to form a new heteroduplex product . Subsequently , branch migration mediates the extension of the heteroduplex product ( Cox and Lehman , 1981 ) . Homology search is the first step in synapsis and is arguably the most mysterious aspect of the strand exchange reaction ( Barzel and Kupiec , 2008 ) . A RecA filament has to rapidly and accurately find a homologous sequence in the presence of a vast excess of non-homologous dsDNA . The multivalent nature of the RecA filament enables it to sustain contact with a long dsDNA while allowing for frequent dissociation events that permits rapid sampling of different segments of the DNA , thus facilitating homology search ( Forget and Kowalczykowski , 2012 ) . Experiments involving the mechanical manipulation of the incoming dsDNA upon binding to the RecA filament identified structural intermediates which facilitate homology recognition and provided insight into mechanisms by which RecA can discriminate between homologous and non-homologous DNA sequences ( Danilowicz et al . , 2012; De Vlaminck et al . , 2012; Peacock-Villada et al . , 2012 ) . However , random 3D collision between a RecA filament and the dsDNA even when aided by intersegmental transfer is unlikely to result in precise alignment of matching sequences . For this reason , RecA filament sliding on dsDNA , even over a short distance range of ten to hundreds of bp would significantly accelerate the search for homology . Although many proteins are now known to diffuse along the DNA via 1D sliding ( Blainey et al . , 2006; Wang et al . , 2006; Gorman et al . , 2007; Bonnet et al . , 2008; Liu et al . , 2008; Roy et al . , 2009; Zhou et al . , 2011 ) RecA filament diffusion on DNA has not been observed before and in fact an early study ruled out a role for long range ( approximately several kb ) 1D sliding during homology search ( Adzuma , 1998 ) . Here , we utilized the high spatio-temporal resolution of single molecule FRET ( Ha et al . , 1996 ) to examine the possibility of RecA filament sliding during homology search . Using two and three color FRET measurements , we show that RecA filament slides along dsDNA , primarily mediated by electrostatic interactions . Furthermore , by using sequences with short stretches of homology , we could monitor repeated events of homology recognition and disengagement in real time without full dissociation of RecA filament from dsDNA . RecA-mediated homology search is the first example of a DNA bound multi protein complex which can slide on another DNA during target search process . It may also serve as a canonical example for other proteins ( e . g . , telomerase and Argonaute ) which are bound to nucleic acid sequences that act as ‘guide’ strands conferring target site specificity . 2 Results For short ( <80 bp ) homologous dsDNA substrates , homology search is completed rapidly ( within 30 ms ) once the dsDNA encounters a RecA filament ( Ragunathan et al . , 2011 ) . Therefore , we used a non-homologous dsDNA to avoid stable product formation and monitor RecA filament in the act of homology search . We immobilized a partial dsDNA with a 5′ 39 nt ssDNA tail on a passivated quartz surface via biotin–neutravidin interaction ( Figure 1A ) . The DNA is labeled with a FRET acceptor ( Cy5 ) at the ssDNA/dsDNA junction . We first formed a stable RecA filament on the DNA by using ATPγS as the cofactor . Then , we added a solution containing non-homologous dsDNA ( LdsDNA = 39 bp ) and ATPγS while simultaneously removing free RecA from solution , allowing us to observe the interaction solely between the incoming non-homologous dsDNA ( free of RecA ) and a single isolated RecA filament . RecA filaments formed under these conditions are stable and can carry out the strand exchange reaction with a homologous dsDNA ( Ragunathan et al . , 2011 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 00067 . 003Figure 1 . Dynamic interactions between RecA filament and non-homologous dsDNA . ( A ) A schematic of the single molecule FRET based assay to detect interactions between RecA filament and non-homologous dsDNA . After RecA filament formation on ssDNA ( Lfilament = 39 nt ) labeled with an acceptor ( red ) , a non-homologous dsDNA ( LdsDNA = 39 bp ) labeled with a donor was added . DNA docking results in appearance of donor ( green ) signal with FRET reporting on the changes in distance .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 00067 . 006 Docking of non-homologous dsDNA to the RecA filament is detected as an abrupt appearance of fluorescence signal from the background level . After docking , we observed large and rapid fluctuations in FRET detected as anti-correlated changes of donor and acceptor intensities . The FRET fluctuations are indicative of extensive distance changes between the donor on the dsDNA and the acceptor on the RecA/ssDNA filament . Single molecule time traces show multiple dsDNA binding and dissociation events to the same filament because the observed interactions are transient without forming a stable product ( Figure 1B ) . The lifetime of the binding events is exponentially distributed with an average lifetime of 3 . 5 s ( Figure 1C ) . Filaments formed with ATP displayed similar FRET fluctuations upon docking of non-homologous dsDNA and exhibit comparable dissociation times ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C ) . Hence , the fluctuations observed here do not require ATP hydrolysis . Using different lengths for the ssDNA tail ( Lfilament = 50 or 99 nt ) did not significantly change the lifetime of the encounter complex ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2A ) . In contrast , increasing dsDNA length increased the lifetime presumably due to a larger number of contacts between the dsDNA and the RecA filament ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2B ) . We determined the lifetime of the transient encounter complex as a function of magnesium or sodium concentrations . Rapid FRET fluctuations persisted under all the solution conditions tested while the lifetime of the complex decreased with increasing magnesium or sodium concentrations suggesting that the interaction is electrostatic in nature and can be weakened by increased screening ( Figure 1D–F ) . Indeed , eliminating negative charge from the RecA C-terminus ( Lusetti et al . , 2003 ) by deletion of acidic residues resulted in an increased lifetime of dsDNA bound to the RecA filament ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3 ) . We considered two possible explanations for the large FRET fluctuations observed upon docking of dsDNA to the RecA filament . The first involves limited unwinding of the dsDNA ( Bianchi et al . , 1985 ) by the RecA filament resulting in separation of the duplex ends . Repeated melting and annealing transitions at the labeled end of the dsDNA could in principle result in FRET fluctuations . We tested this possibility using a dsDNA ( LdsDNA = 39 bp ) labeled at one duplex end ( donor and acceptor fluorophores on the two opposing strands ) so that local melting would cause a FRET decrease and vice versa . When the dsDNA docks to an unlabeled RecA filament immobilized on the surface , we observed stable high FRET ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) suggesting that separation of the duplex ends is not the source of FRET fluctuations described in Figure 1 . The second explanation involves 1D sliding ( or diffusion ) of the RecA filament along dsDNA . In order to test the sliding model , we examined whether changes in the length of the RecA filament would affect the time scale of FRET fluctuations since such a change would modulate the encounter frequency between the donor and the acceptor fluorophores . In contrast , conformational changes either within the dsDNA or the protein would presumably exhibit the same time scale of FRET fluctuations independent of RecA filament length . Shorter RecA filaments ( Lfilament = 21 nt ) exhibited more rapid FRET changes and of smaller amplitudes ( Figure 2A ) compared to longer filaments ( Lfilament = 99 nt ) which showed larger and slower changes in FRET ( Figure 2B ) . To quantify the time scale of FRET fluctuations , we determined cross-correlation of the donor and acceptor fluorescence intensities for four different filament lengths ( Lfilament = 21 , 39 , 69 and 99 nt ) and a single length of non-homologous dsDNA ( LdsDNA = 39 bp ) . The average cross correlation time increased with increasing filament lengths ( Figure 2C ) , supporting the 1D sliding model . Furthermore , the histogram of FRET efficiencies ( E ) shifted towards lower FRET values for increasing filament lengths ( Figure 2D ) . This observation also supports the 1D sliding model because the two fluorophores would spend a smaller fraction of time in close proximity if the filament is longer . To estimate the diffusion coefficient of the 1D sliding process , we performed Monte Carlo simulations of dsDNA diffusing along a RecA filament ( ‘Experimental procedures’ and Figure 2—figure supplement 2 ) . Given its large persistence length of about 800 nm ( Hegner et al . , 1999 ) , we treated the RecA filament as a rigid rod . We then simulated time traces of donor and acceptor intensities of dsDNA bound to RecA filament of various lengths using different pre-assigned diffusion coefficients ( Dslide ) and then calculated the average cross correlation times for each case . By comparing the simulation results with the experimental data we estimated the diffusion constant Dslide for 1D sliding of dsDNA relative to the RecA filament to be approximately 0 . 9 × 10−3 μm2/s or 7700 bp2/s . Additionally the time scale of sliding ( as measured by the cross correlation time ) does not change as a function of sodium or magnesium ion concentrations in solution while the sliding time scale increases twofold when ATPγS is replaced by ATP ( Figure 2—figure supplement 3A–B ) . However , the use of ATP as a co-factor , especially in experiments involving short ssDNA substrates is complicated by the dissociation of RecA monomers from the ssDNA ends leading to filament instabilities which could potentially disrupt sliding along the RecA filament track . 10 . 7554/eLife . 00067 . 007Figure 2 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 00067 . 010 To further test the 1D sliding model , we designed a three-color FRET assay . Here , the immobilized RecA filament is labeled with two different acceptor fluorophores , Cy5 at the ssDNA/dsDNA junction and Cy7 in the middle of the ssDNA embedded within the RecA filament ( Figure 3A ) . The two acceptors are separated by 33 nt , which upon RecA binding results in a large separation and negligible FRET between them ( Joo et al . , 2006 ) . The sliding model predicts anticorrelated changes between the two FRET efficiencies , one between Cy3 and Cy5 ( ECy3-Cy5 ) and the other between Cy3 and Cy7 ( ECy3-Cy7 ) because when Cy3 on the dsDNA approaches Cy5 , it should move away from Cy7 and vice versa . We observed large and rapid fluctuations in FRET from Cy3 to Cy5 ( ECy3-Cy5 ) and FRET from Cy3 to Cy7 ( ECy3-Cy7 ) ( Figure 3B , bottom panel ) . Consistent with the sliding model , the time trace of ECy3-Cy5 and ECy3-Cy7 exhibits anticorrelation between the two FRET efficiencies . The timescale of fluctuations determined from the cross-correlation of the two FRET efficiencies ( Txcorr-3color = 0 . 04 s ) ( Figure 3C ) is similar to that measured using the two color assay ( Figure 2C ) . The scatter plot of ECy3-Cy5 vs ECy3-Cy7 and calculation of Pearson's correlation coefficient for the two FRET efficiencies ( rpearson = −0 . 6 ) provide further support for a negative correlation between ECy3-Cy5 and ECy3-Cy7 ( Figure 3D ) . Hence , cumulatively the two and three color FRET results support the sliding model . 10 . 7554/eLife . 00067 . 011Figure 3 . Three color FRET observations support RecA filament sliding .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 00067 . 011 Can the sliding of RecA filament along dsDNA be a physiologically relevant activity , that is , can the RecA filament recognize a homologous sequence during sliding ? To answer this question , we embedded two repeats of an identical sequence at positions HS1 and HS2 within an otherwise non-homologous ssDNA ( Figure 4A ) . If the target dsDNA contains base pairs which are homologous to the short repeat sequence , it may be possible to observe back and forth sliding events between the two homology sites ( HS1 and HS2 ) without full dissociation of the dsDNA from the RecA filament . Such an observation would indicate that RecA filament sliding allows for homology recognition and base pairing . In all cases , HS1 and HS2 are complementary to a sequence in close proximity to the donor labeled end of the target dsDNA and the location and spacing between the two homology sites were chosen to be within a FRET sensitive regime ( approximately 20–80 Å ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 00067 . 012Figure 4 .

Recognition of homology site 1 ( HS1 ) or homology site 2 ( HS2 ) results in the appearance distinct FRET states whose values depend on their relative distances from the acceptor .

Rate enhancement due to sliding vs probability of binding ( pbind ) to a target site for different values of the sliding distance ( s ) . The rate enhancement of target search due to sliding is given by the ratio of the rate of association of RecA filament with the target site in the presence of sliding to the rate of association with the target site in the absence of sliding ( D = 0 ) . In this hypothetical model , RecA filaments can bind non-specifically to DNA but do not slide . kaslidekaD=0=1+2s1+2s ( 1−pbind ) / ( 1+2s2pbind ) pbind is the probability of binding with the target site in each nonspecific encounter and is dependent on the microscopic rate constant associated with the recognition of a target site . Kaslide and KaD=0 are the association rates with and without sliding respectively .

To test if the dsDNA may flip its orientation relative to the RecA filament during homology search , we moved the donor fluorophore to the end opposite to the labeling position used for the experiments shown in Figure 4 . Single molecule FRET time traces were obtained following dsDNA docking to a RecA filament formed on a DNA strand containing two identical homology sites with 8 nt homology at each site . ( A ) Orange highlight denotes the DNA segment which is complementary to HS1 and HS2 . Homology recognition positions the unlabeled end of the dsDNA in close proximity to the acceptor dye resulting in stable low FRET . Time trace of fluorescence intensities ( top panel ) and corresponding FRET values ( bottom panel ) are shown . A pulse of red illumination ( three frames , time resolution = 30 ms ) with no green illumination was applied in order to verify the presence of a fluorescently active acceptor . Pulses of red illumination are indicated as red shaded portions in the single molecule time trace . ( B ) Binding in the opposite orientation results in lack of homology recognition leading to rapid FRET fluctuations which are not interrupted by stable low FRET states . If flipping was possible , homology recognition at the unlabeled end would result in the low FRET states interspersed with rapid FRET fluctuations . ( C ) Histogram of all single molecule time traces exhibiting FRET displays a broad distribution . ( D ) A poly T ssDNA ( Lfilament = 50 nt ) with an acceptor fluorophore ( Cy5 ) at the junction was immobilized . Non-homologous dsDNA was labeled at the 5′end of the opposite strand . Single molecule FRET time exhibits rapid FRET fluctuations due to lack of homology recognition . ( E ) Histogram of single molecule time traces exhibiting FRET displays a broad distribution . The similarity in the time traces and FRET histograms shown in ( B and C ) and ( D and E ) suggest that the rapid FRET fluctuations with a broad distribution observed are due to dsDNA sliding on RecA filament without being perturbed by homology recognition events . Given that flipping does not occur , we conclude that a dsDNA that binds to a RecA filament in the wrong orientation cannot establish the correct orientation without full dissociation and rebinding . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 00067 . 016 We confirmed that dsDNA docking to a RecA filament formed on a ssDNA homopolymer sequence ( poly-T sequence , Lfilament = 50 nt ) preserves the large and rapid FRET fluctuations ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 and Figure 2B ) . We then introduced two identical sequences of length , Lh = 5 nt , at HS1 and HS2 positions which are complementary to a 5 bp sequence within the target dsDNA ( LdsDNA = 39 bp ) . Binding of the dsDNA to the RecA filament formed on the ssDNA with the two 5 nt repeats displayed rapid FRET fluctuations across a broad range of FRET values ( Figure 4B , E ) similar to that observed using a poly-T DNA sequence ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) . In contrast , when we increased the length of homology at HS1 and HS2 by a single nucleotide to Lh = 6 nt , single molecule time traces displayed transitions between discrete FRET states ( Figure 4C ) . The same trend was observed upon further increasing the homology length to Lh = 7 nt ( Figure 4D ) . The resulting FRET histograms for 6 and 7 nt homology lengths showed distinct FRET peaks ( Figure 4F , G ) . In order to confirm that the observed FRET peaks arise from base pairing and recognition at specific homology sites , we analyzed different ssDNA sequences containing only one of the two 6 nt homology sites ( HS1 or HS2 ) and obtained a distinct FRET peak at either approximately 0 . 9 or 0 . 5 , respectively ( Figure 4H , I ) . Thus , we assigned the highest FRET state ( approximately 0 . 9 ) to homology recognition and base pairing at HS1 and the mid FRET state ( approximately 0 . 5 ) to homology recognition and base pairing at HS2 . The lowest FRET state , E ∼ 0 . 1 , is likely to correspond to dsDNA sliding outside the boundary of HS1 and HS2 in a FRET insensitive regime . Given that this location lacks stable base pairing interactions , we referred to the low FRET state as the non-homologous state ( NH ) . Although the gap between HS1 and HS2 is 5 nt , it is noteworthy that the total distance traversed by dsDNA to exhibit complete basepairing is ( Lh + 5 ) nt . Thus , for the smallest Lh of 6 nt , this translates to a distance of approximately 50 Ǻ ( 11 nt × 3 . 4 Ǻ × 1 . 5 ) . Given the rapid movements of the dsDNA between adjacent homology sites and the fact that both the dsDNA and RecA filament are stiff at the length scales of our experiments , we cannot think of mechanisms other than sliding to explain the observed transitions . We used a statistical approach based on Hidden Markov Model ( HMM ) analysis to make unbiased assignments of the various FRET states present within each single molecule time trace . The FRET transitions obtained from HMM analysis were then plotted in the form of a transition density plot ( TDP ) which is a 2D histogram reflecting the frequency of transitions between the various FRET states . For Lh = 6 nt , the TDP obtained from 236 molecules exhibiting 13 , 020 transitions displays three distinct FRET states , E ∼ 0 . 1 , 0 . 5 and 0 . 9 ( Figure 4J ) . Furthermore , the HMM/TDP analysis gave the transition rates and the number of transitions between the different FRET states . The rate of departing HS1 or HS2 was threefold lower than that of leaving NH , showing that even 6 bp homology can significantly stabilize joint molecule formation ( Figure 4L ) . Similarly , we fitted the data for Lh = 7 nt using HMM analysis ( 191 molecules , 3819 transitions ) and extracted the transition rates and number of transitions from the resulting TDP ( Figure 4K ) . As expected , we observed a slower rate of leaving HS1 and HS2 for Lh = 7 nt compared to Lh = 6 nt ( Figure 4L ) . Also , the dissociation rate of dsDNA bound to HS1 was higher than that of dsDNA bound to HS2 possibly because HS1 is located at the filament end where the terminal RecA monomer at the ssDNA–dsDNA junction binds with altered kinetics ( Joo et al . , 2006 ) as opposed to HS2 which is embedded within the RecA filament and benefits from complementary basepairing with the homology site and stabilizing interactions with neighboring RecA monomers . Interestingly , transitions did not occur solely between neighboring sites ( NH<->HS2 and HS1<->HS2 type transitions ) but also involved transitions of the type NH->HS1 indicating that the RecA filament might overlook a region of homology during the sliding process . Homology recognition and base pairing of dsDNA at either HS1 or HS2 during sliding is a stochastic process . For a dsDNA initially bound to a non-homologous site ( NH ) , the efficiency with which the first homology site the dsDNA encounters , HS2 , is recognized before the more distant homology site , HS1 , is recognized is given by , ErecognitionNH->HS2=NNH->HS2 ( NNH->HS2+NNH->HS1 ) , where NNH->HS1 and NNH->HS2 denote the number of transitions from NH->HS1 and NH->HS2 respectively . For 6 nt homology ( Lh = 6 nt ) the efficiency of homology site recognition , ErecognitionNH->HS2 is approximately 55% . This efficiency increased for 7 nt homology ( ErecognitionNH->HS2 for Lh = 7 nt is approximately 77% ) . Cumulatively , our data suggest that the efficiency of homology recognition by the RecA filament increases with the number of homologous nucleotides available for basepairing . We could not perform a similar analysis for Lh = 8 nt since dsDNA bound to HS1 and HS2 positions in this case exhibited stable FRET states and transitions between them were rare ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2 ) . 3 Discussion Our study establishes RecA filament sliding as a possible mechanism to assist homology search during strand exchange reaction . Until now , there has been no example of a multi-protein complex bound to DNA such as the RecA filament which is capable of sliding along a second DNA strand to locate a matching sequence of bases . We estimated the diffusion constant , Dslide , for RecA filament sliding to be approximately 0 . 9 × 10−3 μm2/s or 7700 bp2/s . Because the lifetime of heterologous synapses ranges from 0 . 5 to 10 s ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2B ) ( Mani et al . , 2009; Forget and Kowalczykowski , 2012 ) , we estimate that dsDNA would diffuse over a length of 60–300 bp during each encounter with a RecA filament prior to its dissociation . Using the estimated diffusion coefficient and sliding distance , we calculated the effective rate enhancement of target search due to sliding which is given by the ratio of the rate of association of RecA filament with the target site in the presence of sliding to the rate of association with the target site in the absence of sliding ( D = 0 ) ( Hammar et al . , 2012 ) . In this hypothetical model , RecA filaments can bind non-specifically to DNA but do not slide ( Figure 4—figure supplement 3 ) . Though , we do not know the exact microscopic rate constants which determine the binding probability of the RecA filament to the target site ( pbind ) , we can estimate that even for a recognition probability as low as approximately 1% , sliding leads to a rate enhancement in homology search by approximately 200-fold . If no sliding is allowed and homology must be recognized via fortuitous 3D contact that aligns the dsDNA and filament in perfect registry , homology recognition would be about two orders of magnitude slower . Therefore , 1D sliding combined with intersegmental transfer proposed by Forget and Kowalcyzkowski ( 2012 ) can dramatically accelerate homology search . We cannot rule out the possibility that changes in angle between the dsDNA and the RecA filament ( off-axis motions ) might affect the observed FRET changes . Incorporating such effects of off-axis motions into the model would increase the time scale of linear sliding but the effect will be small because control experiments such as the DNA length dependence ( Figure 2C ) showed that on-axis motion is the dominant source of FRET fluctuations . Although our experimental scheme cannot probe for small and dynamic off-axis motions between the RecA filament and dsDNA , we can at least rule out the extreme possibility of ‘dsDNA flipping’ in which case the dsDNA may undergo a 180° change in orientation while remaining bound to the RecA filament ( Figure 4—figure supplement 4 ) . Therefore , a dsDNA that binds to a RecA filament in the wrong orientation cannot establish the correct orientation required for homology recognition and basepairing without full dissociation and rebinding . We also demonstrated that homology recognition and base pairing processes can occur during sliding . Our results showed that as few as 6 nt of complementary base pairs are sufficient to act as the unit of homology recognition for RecA mediated homology search . It is noteworthy that recognition of a homology site is a stochastic process and the efficiency of homology recognition by the RecA filament depends on the length of homology which is encountered at a particular site . Furthermore , we show that adding even a single nucleotide to the minimum recognition unit of 6 nt improves recognition efficiency by approximately 1 . 5-fold . Proteins mediate target search reactions by a combination of 1D sliding and 3D diffusion based processes ( Gorman and Greene , 2008 ) . While intersegmental transfer serves to bring non-contiguous segments of dsDNA close to each other , 1D sliding during homology search could help RecA reorganize the initial synaptic complex in cis without the need for a RecA filament to fully dissociate and rebind to a nearby homology site located within a short distance ( up to few hundred base pairs ) . Given the ability of the RecA filament to slide between nearby homology sites ( Figure 4 ) , sliding could serve as a mechanism to rapidly scan neighboring sequences for the existence of an optimal seed sequence from which base pair propagation and heteroduplex extension reactions can proceed . An earlier report demonstrated sliding of Rad51 oligomers ( not a Rad51 filament bound to ssDNA ) without any clear functional role attributed to the observed sliding activity ( Graneli et al . , 2006 ) . Because of significant structural and functional similarities between RecA and Rad51 ( Conway et al . , 2004 ) , it is likely that sliding might also play a role in homology search mediated by Rad51 . 4 Materials and methods DNA oligos used in our measurements were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies ( IDT , Coralville , IA ) . The oligos were suspended in T50 buffer ( 10 mM Tris-Cl , 50 mM NaCl , pH 8 . 0 ) . The DNA sequences used in our measurements are specified in Supplementary file 1 . Double strand DNA was prepared by mixing complementary DNA molecules and heating to 90°C followed by slow cooling to room temperature over a period of 2 hr . dsDNA was purified from free ssDNA using a 12% native PAGE gel to ensure the absence of free ssDNA in our dsDNA preparations . The partial duplex DNA molecules for immobilization were prepared by annealing with the biotin_DNA sequence . All DNA molecules were labeled at the terminal ends ( 5′ or 3′ ) with Cy3 or Cy5 ( labeling performed by IDT ) as specified in the experimental scheme . For internally labeled DNA oligos , Cy3 N-hydroxysuccinimido ( NHS ) ester and Cy5 NHS ester ( GE Healthcare ) were internally labeled to a dT of ssDNA modified via a C6 amino linker ( IDT , Coralville , IA ) . The quartz ( Finkenbeiner , Waltham , MA ) surface is passivated with Polyethylene glycol ( m-PEG-5000; Laysan Bio Inc . ) and 1–2% biotinylated PEG ( biotin-PEG-5000; Laysan Bio Inc . , Arab , AL ) . The coating of the quartz imaging surface with PEG ( Roy et al . , 2008 ) eliminated effects due to non-specific binding of proteins . Acceptor labeled reference ssDNA molecules were immobilized on the passivated surface by means of a biotin–neutravidin interaction . After washing away excess of acceptor molecules , the reference ssDNA was incubated with 1 μM RecA ( Epicenter biotechnologies , Madison , WI ) and 1 mM ATPγS ( EMD Calbiochem , Billerica , MA ) in an incubation buffer containing 25 mM Tris Acetate pH 7 . 5 , 100 mM Sodium Acetate and 1 mM Magnesium Acetate . In some cases , 1 mM ATP was used instead of ATPγS . RecA ΔC17 protein was a generous gift from Dr . M . M . Cox ( University of Wisconsin ) . After incubation for 15 min to ensure complete filament formation on ssDNA ( Lfilament ) molecules , the buffer in the chamber was exchanged with a solution of non-homologous dsDNA ( 1 nM ) and 1 mM ATPγS in a strand exchange buffer ( 25 mM Tris Acetate pH 7 . 5 , 100 mM Sodium Acetate , 10 mM or 1 mM Magnesium Acetate ) supplemented with an oxygen scavenging system ( 1 mg/mL glucose oxidase , 0 . 8% glucose , 0 . 04 mg/mL catalase and 3 mM Trolox ) . Imaging was initiated as soon as the buffer exchange was complete . All measurements were carried out at room temperature ( 23 ± 1°C ) . Excitation of the donor , Cy3 , was carried out using a Nd:YAG laser ( 532 nm , 75 mW; Crystalaser , Reno , NV ) by means of prism type total internal reflection microscopy ( Roy et al . , 2008 ) . After filtering the scattered excitation light using a 550 nm long pass filter , fluorescence emission from the donor and the acceptor was refocused onto an EMCCD camera ( Andor , UK ) . The Cy3 and Cy5 emissions were split into two channels using a 630 nm dichroic mirror . In the case of three color measurements involving Cy3 , Cy5 and Cy7 , an additional dichroic mirror ( 730 nm ) was used to split the emission across three emission channels . The time resolution for all single molecule strand exchange experiments was 30 ms unless otherwise specified . The data acquisition was carried out using home built software written in Visual C++ . The movies obtained with the CCD were analyzed first using IDL and the intensities of the fluorophores and the time traces was visualized using customized MATLAB programs ( Joo and Ha , 2008; Roy et al . , 2008 ) . The dwell time analysis was carried out by a home-written MATLAB program . The background intensity in the donor and acceptor channel was subtracted followed by leakage subtraction of the donor signal to the acceptor channel . Details regarding the acquisition and analysis are based on previously published methods . After visually inspecting the acquired data , we manually selected the relevant time periods for analysis and used Origin 8 . 0 to plot the data . Cross-correlation analysis was performed as previously described ( Kim et al . , 2002 ) by calculating cross-correlation functions for donor and acceptor time traces for a given molecule . Fitting the averaged cross-correlation functions to a single exponential function allows to estimate the average cross correlation time for each measurement . Three color data analysis was performed as previously described ( Hohng et al . , 2004; Roy et al . , 2009 ) . Following leakage correction for Cy3 , Cy5 and Cy7 intensities , we additionally corrected Cy7 intensity by utilizing a gamma factor ( to correct for differences in optics and detection efficiency ) . γ=ΔICy5ΔICy7ΔICy5 and ΔICy7 represent the ratio of the change in intensity in Cy5 and Cy7 channels which is calculated by following the change in intensity in the two channels following Cy7 photobleaching . ECy3->Cy5 , the FRET efficiency corresponding to Cy3–Cy5 interaction and ECy3->Cy7 corresponding to the Cy3-Cy7 interaction was calculated asED-A , i=IA , iΣIA , i+ID , where ID and IA are the donor and acceptor intensities respectively . The suffix , i , denotes the two acceptors Cy5 and Cy7 utilized in this measurement . We carefully designed the three color measurement to ensure that the two acceptors Cy5 and Cy7 spaced far apart from each other . such that ECy5->Cy7 ∼ 0 and the presence of a stable RecA filament ( by using ATPγS ) results in the spacing between Cy5 and Cy7 remaining unchanged during the course of the measurement . Software for acquiring and analyzing single molecule FRET data is freely available for download from https://physics . illinois . edu/cplc/software . Monte Carlo ( MC ) simulation of the free diffusion along dsDNA was written in MATLAB . Since the persistence length of RecA-ssDNA was reported to be approximately 784 nm ( approximately 2300 bp ) ( Hegner et al . , 1999 ) , the RecA-DNA filaments in our experiments can be simply treated as a rod in one dimension . Equal probabilities of moving forward or backward were generated by the program . The step size of the MC simulation was set to be small enough ( 0 . 1 or 0 . 01 bp , in our case ) to mimic continuous sliding of the RecA filament along dsDNA . The distance between the donor and acceptor fluorophores and their corresponding FRET value was calculated after each step . Since RecA binding to ssDNA results in an average rise between successive nucleotides of d = 5 . 1 Å/bp , L could be expressed byL=r2+ ( d×|x−xo| ) 2 , where x and xo respectively represent the position of non-homologous dsDNA and the static acceptor along the dsDNA . Total intensity of each data bin , 30 ms , is set to be 500 a . u . , matching our typical data intensity in TIRF experiments . Gaussian white noise with a peak intensity of 40 a . u . is applied . Finally , same cross correlation ( CC ) analysis as described before was applied to the MC simulated traces for calibration purpose ( τ , dwell time of CC analysis; D , diffusion coefficient ) ."}

We used fMRI in rhesus monkeys to identify brain regions underlying head gaze following and to assess their relationship to the ‘face patch’ system , the latter being the likely source of information on face orientation . We trained monkeys to locate targets by either following head gaze or using a learned association of face identity with the same targets . Head gaze following activated a distinct region in the posterior STS , close to-albeit not overlapping with-the medial face patch delineated by passive viewing of faces . This ‘gaze following patch’ may be the substrate of the geometrical calculations needed to translate information on head orientation from the face patches into precise shifts of attention , taking the spatial relationship of the two interacting agents into account .", "plain language summary": "Gaze following—working out where someone else is looking , and then switching your attention to that position—is an important part of social behavior and learning . Additionally , it is thought to be an important step towards recognizing that others have a mind of their own . Humans mostly use eye position to work out the ‘gaze direction’ of someone else , whereas non-human primates rely instead on the orientation of the face . However , the neural circuits that control gaze following are thought to be similar in both . Gaze following is a complex process that requires the brain to process a lot of different information . A face must be recognized , and its orientation worked out . A series of complex geometrical calculations must then be performed to work out the direction of the gaze , and how this relates to the position of the observer . Finally , the object of interest needs to be recognized and the attention of the observer focused on it . In the monkey brain , there are six interconnected areas called face patch regions that respond when a monkey is shown a face . However , researchers do not understand how monkeys translate the information about face orientation gathered by these regions into information about where to look during gaze following . Marciniak et al . performed functional magnetic resonance imaging on monkeys to track the flow of blood to different regions of the brain—the higher the blood flow , the more that area of the brain is working . To identify the location of their face patch regions , the monkeys first looked at faces . When the monkeys then performed a gaze following task , a region of the brain close to—but not overlapping—the face patches was activated . Marciniak et al . suggest this is the ‘gaze following patch’ where the brain performs the demanding calculations to translate face orientation into a position to look at . As gaze following is important in social interactions , understanding the neural circuits behind it could help us understand social disorders .", "article": "1 Introduction Successful social interactions require understanding of peer dispositions , desires , beliefs and intentions . A major step in developing this theory of ( the other one's ) mind ( TOM ) is our ability to shift our attention to the same location and/or object the other one is interested in , that is to establish joint attention ( Baron-Cohen , 1995 ) . By associating our own object-related aspirations and intentions with the object , we may arrive at a viable theory of the other one's mind . In order to shift our attention to the right place or object , we rely on spatial information provided by peer body such as the direction of a pointing finger or the orientation of the head and the shoulder girdle . In case of humans , arguably the most important bodily cue , reliably providing extremely precise spatial information ( Bock et al . , 2008 ) , is peer eye gaze , a cue that can be easily retrieved even from quite some distance because of the high contrast border between the eye's dark center and periphery . The eyes of macaque monkeys and many other nonhuman primates ( NHP ) lack comparable contrasts ( Kobayashi and Kohshima , 1997 ) , which is why eye gaze seems to be of little importance in this group ( Lorincz et al . , 1999 ) . While monkeys seem to lack a full-fledged TOM ( Anderson et al . , 1996 ) ( Flombaum and Santos , 2005 for a different view ) , they are nevertheless able to establish joint attention with conspecifics , largely relying on head gaze , that is the orientation of peer head ( =face ) . Importantly , not only human but also monkey gaze following seems to be geometric: the observer identifies peer focus of attention by following his/her gaze towards the object of interest ( Emery et al . , 1997; Emery , 2000 ) . In other words , rather than simply using the directional information provided by a gaze cue to shift attention out from the center until an object of potential interest is encountered , geometrical gaze following implies that a gaze vector is defined which is used to search for the object of interest ( Butterworth and Jarrett , 1991 ) . Another important feature shared by the gaze following of monkeys and man is the dependence on social context . For instance , human observers tend to prefer gaze cues of those whom they feel close to Liuzza et al . ( 2011 ) , while monkeys are particularly eager to follow the gaze of higher status conspecifics ( Shepherd et al . , 2006 ) . The availability of geometric gaze following in monkeys and man and the modulatory influence of context supports the idea that monkey and human gaze following may actually be closely related , sharing homologous substrates , although the choice of the relevant social cue—eye vs head—differs . In any case , perceiving peer eye or head gaze and converting it into a gaze vector is only a first step in a sequence of demanding computations that ultimately lead to the establishment of joint attention . This is a consequence of the fact that objects of interest may lie anywhere relative to the demonstrator and the observer . Only if the object were midway between the two , joint attention could be established by simply mirroring the demonstrator's gaze vector . However , as this specific location will be an exception rather than the rule , the object position will have to be transformed from a demonstrator-centered frame of reference ( FOR ) into an observer-centered FOR before a successful shift of attention can be programmed . Previous work on gaze following suggests that the computational steps leading from the extraction of eye and/or head direction to shifts of attention are based on a distributed network of areas located in the superior temporal sulcus and the posterior parietal cortex . For instance , single unit recordings from monkey area LIP suggest that it is the major substrate of the shifts of attention which are prompted by social cues providing spatial information ( Shepherd et al . , 2009 ) as well as by non-social spatial cues ( Bisley et al . , 2011 ) . On the other hand , BOLD imaging studies of human cortex have consistently singled out an area in the posterior superior temporal sulcus ( pSTS ) specifically activated by the processing of eye gaze cues leading to subsequent shifts of attention ( Materna et al . , 2008a ) . BOLD imaging is also able to delineate a patch of cortex in the monkey STS activated by head gaze following , arguably offering similar functionality as the human pSTS region and perhaps even being homologous ( Kamphuis et al . , 2009 ) . Yet , what this specific functionality might be remains unclear . An obvious possibility is that this 'gaze following patch' may contribute to extracting relevant facial features . This possibility is supported by the fact that previous work on face processing has established a set of six disparate but interconnected 'face patches' distributed along the rostro-caudal extent of the monkey STS , that is found in the same general region as the gaze following patch ( Tsao et al . , 2003 , 2008 ) . As previous work on face processing has suggested that these face patches form a hierarchically organized network with functionally specialized nodes ( Moeller et al . , 2008; Freiwald and Tsao , 2010 ) , we reasoned that one of these nodes might actually correspond to the gaze following patch . Using fMRI to delineate the passive face patch network and the gaze following patch in the same rhesus monkeys , we here show that , surprisingly , this expectation is not met . Rather than being part of the face patch network , the gaze following patch remains outside the network , albeit close to one of its nodes , the medial face patch . 2 Results In the first experiment , the two monkey subjects ( 'observers' ) were exposed to the portraits of fpur monkey individuals turning their head at one out of four different targets arranged along the horizontal . The two observers were instructed to either use head gaze orientation to identify the spatial target ( gaze following ) or , alternatively , to exploit learned associations between the identity of the seen faces and the individual targets ( identity-matching condition ) while ignoring head gaze ( Figure 1A , B ) . The target choice was indicated by precise saccades to one of the four targets ( Figure 1C ) . In other words , the two conditions were the same in terms of the visual information provided by the presented portraits as well as the motor behavior the visual stimuli prompted . However , they differed with regard to the facial cues used to prompt shifts of attention . We compared the accuracy of behavioral responses as measured by the percentages of correct choices for the gaze following and the identity-matching task , using data sets underlying the fMRI analysis . The accuracy levels were not significantly different in the two tasks ( Figure 1D ) . Saccade latencies were also not different ( Figure 1E ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 03222 . 003Figure 1 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 03222 . 003 The two control tasks used to rule out that monkeys might have managed to circumvent true gaze following in the gaze following task by resorting to learned associations between the position of the portraits on the screen and the spatial ( or ordinal ) position of the targets , were carried out only outside the scanner . We assigned responses to three possible categories , the first one consistent with gaze following , the second one comprising responses reflecting a workaround strategy ( control experiment 1: learned spatial associations; control experiment 2: learned order associations ) and the third one , neither consistent with category 1 nor 2 ( Figure 2A , B; ‘Materials and methods’ ) . In each and every case the number of responses in the gaze following category by far surpassed the numbers in the two other categories ( Figure 2C , D ) . The dominance of gaze following was statistically highly significant ( Figure 2C , D ) . These behavioral results clearly demonstrated that the observers M1 and M2 followed the gaze of the monkey portrait in the gaze following task . To solve the identity-matching task , the two monkeys obviously used individually adjusted strategies to identify the correct target . Depending on the behavioral context , they relied primarily on associations of individual identities with absolute spatial position or on relative spatial order ( Figure 2—figure supplements 1–4 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 03222 . 004Figure 2 .

Design of the control experiments testing for learned associations between facial identity and the spatial position of the target . It was performed outside the MRI scanner in order to shed light on the strategies utilized to solve the identity matching task . The observer was confronted with a sequence of normal identity matching trials ( I ) with occasional catch trials ( II , 6–12% share ) in which the demonstrator portrait was shifted horizontally ( shifts of −10° , −5° , 5° and 10° with respect to the default central position , the cartoon assumes −5° shift ) . In any case , the observer was asked to generate a saccade towards the target singled out by facial identity . In the case of ordinary identity matching trials the observer was rewarded contingent on the response . In the case of catch trials , a reward was granted on 50% of the catch trials , independent of the target chosen , provided the observer had stayed on the chosen target for at least 1 s . These responses were later classified into three strategy categories ( III ) . ( 1 ) The 'learned absolute spatial associations' category ( blue outline ) : target chosen according to its absolute spatial position associated with a given demonstrator facial identity , ( invariant in space after demonstrator's portrait shift ) . ( 2 ) The 'learned relative spatial associations' category ( red outline ) : target chosen according to its relative distance associated with a given demonstrator portrait's identity ( now shifted horizontally together with the demonstrator portrait; the cartoon assumes a shift of the target from 10° to 5° ) . ( 3 ) The 'other' category ( gray outline ) . Dashed lines in the figures indicate the observer's eye gaze .

Design of the control experiment testing for associations between the facial identity and the ordinal position of targets . Again it was performed outside the MRI scanner in order to shed light on the strategies utilized to solve the identity matching task . Also here the observer was confronted with a sequence of normal identity matching trials ( I ) with occasional catch trials ( II , 6–12% share ) . In catch trials the outer targets stayed in their standard locations of −10° and 10° respectively , whereas inner targets ( normally at −5° and 5° respectively ) were shifted further out to −15° and 15° eccentricity respectively . As a consequence of this shift , the 10° eccentricity targets maintained their standard spatial position but changed their ordinal position ( from 1 and 4 to 2 and 3 ) ( II ) . Again , the responses in catch trials later classified into three categories ( III ) : ( 1 ) The 'learned order associations' strategy ( target chosen according to its ordinal position in the target order with respect to a given demonstrator's identity , shifted from 10° to 15° on the cartoon , blue outline ) . ( 2 ) The 'learned absolute spatial associations' category ( target chosen according to its absolute spatial position associated with a given demonstrator's identity , keeping his position at 10° on the cartoon , red outline ) , ( 3 ) The 'other' strategy .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 03222 . 008 To identify brain regions specifically activated when the observers relied on gaze orientation , we looked for voxels showing significantly larger BOLD responses to gaze following than to identity matching . Analyzing the whole brain of M1 for the 'gaze following > identity matching' BOLD contrast , the only region showing a significant contrast was a patch of voxels ( ='gaze following ( GF ) patch' ) located unilaterally on the lower bank of the right STS , between the interaural line and 2 mm posterior to it ( A0-P2 ) , near to the dorsal end of the inferior occipital sulcus ( Figure 3 ) . We reasoned that the absence of a significant BOLD contrast on the opposite site might have been the consequence of a poorer signal-to-noise ratio ( SNR ) on the left side , possibly due to the positioning of the eye-tracking camera in front of the left eye . To test it , we performed additional experiments in M1 with a focal coil centered on the posterior left STS , expected to be less affected by the camera . Yet , also with this coil we did not obtain a significant BOLD contrast in the area sampled by the coil , which included the region corresponding to the activated GF patch on the opposite side . Interestingly , despite the fact that the focal coil was centered on the left STS , it allowed us to confirm the right posterior STS BOLD contrast obtained in a whole-brain analysis of the data collected with the bilateral coil ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) . Finally , also the possibility that the unilateral BOLD pattern might be secondary to differences in the behavior directed at the two sides can be excluded . A comparison of responses to the demonstrator's gaze directed to the left and to the right respectively did not reveal any differences in accuracy ( ‘Materials and methods’ ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 03222 . 009Figure 3 .

L = left , R = right . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 03222 . 010 Since the only significant BOLD activation yielded by the whole-brain analysis of M1 was in the STS , we focused our scanning onto the temporal lobes of M2 , using a bilateral and a unilateral coil configuration ( ‘Materials and methods’ ) . By this approach we revealed a significant BOLD contrast for gaze following compared to identity matching in the lower bank of the STS on both sides , around 1 mm anterior to the interaural line ( A1 ) , near the dorsal end of the inferior temporal sulcus ( Figure 3 ) . The GF patch in the right hemisphere of M2 was shifted by 1–2 mm anterior to the coordinates of the GF patch in M1 . It is important to emphasize that the patches were singular in both monkeys and located in the same general part of the STS . This strongly suggests that the slight shift is a manifestation of interindividual variability and thus does not question the spatial identity of the GF patch in the two monkeys . However , it is harder to explain the fact that M2 in the left STS had 3 disparate patches of gaze following-associated BOLD . In terms of their location , the posterior-most patch , which exhibited a much stronger peak BOLD signal than the other two , corresponds to the GF patch on the right side in terms of coordinates . On the other hand , the peak BOLD responses of the two more anterior patches located in the left STS , around A4 and A8 respectively , were much weaker , although consistent across the usage of the two different coil systems . We will reserve the term 'GF patch' to the posterior patch , consistently showing gaze following-associated BOLD activity and use the qualifier 'anterior' when discussing the two anterior patches in the left STS of M2 . For the 'identity matching > gaze following' BOLD contrast we reached significance only at a level of p<0 . 05 ( uncorrected ) . In M1 the activity was found unilaterally on the lower lateral bank of the right STS around 17 mm anterior to the interaural line ( A17 ) . In M2 it was bilateral in the medial part of the STS around 22 mm anterior to the interaural line ( A22 ) . Analyzing the whole brain of M1 and focusing on the temporal lobes of M2 , we identified a pattern of face-specific BOLD activations consisting of a number of distinct patches . Their coordinates and their spatial layout corresponded to the face patches described by previous work ( Tsao et al . , 2003 , 2008; Moeller et al . , 2008 ) and at least partially confirmed by subsequent studies ( Pinsk et al . , 2005; Bell et al . , 2009; Ku et al . , 2011 ) : three bilateral anterior face-patches ( anterior medial , AM; anterior lateral , AL; anterior fundus , AF ) , two middle bilateral face-patches ( middle lateral , ML and middle fundus , MF ) and one bilateral posterior face patch ( posterior lateral , PL ) ( Figure 4 ) . The results were consistent across the two monkeys and consistent across the two different receiver coil systems used in M2 ( focal unilateral coil vs bilateral coil ) . The least clear patches were AM , AF and PL , as the BOLD activation for those voxels reached significance only at a level of p<0 . 05 ( uncorrected ) , whereas the other clusters ( ML , MF and AL ) reached significance already on a level of p<0 . 005 ( uncorrected ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 03222 . 011Figure 4 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 03222 . 012 To explore the relationship of the GF patch ( Experiment 1 ) to the face patches found in Experiment 2 , we projected the BOLD patterns obtained in the two experiments onto coronal sections and onto a partially unfolded 3D representation of the individual monkey's brain , based on anatomical MRI images . The GF patch in the posterior STS did not overlap with any of the face patches we identified ( Figure 4 ) . Actually , the GF patch was posterior ( with respect to the interaural line ) relative to the middle face patches ( ML and MF ) and anterior to the posterior face patch ( PL ) . Moreover , despite the slight difference between the location of the GF patch in the two monkeys the relative distance between this patch and the middle face patch ( ML ) matches in the two monkeys . In other words , the middle face patches of the two monkeys showed a comparable spatial offset to the GF patch . Unlike the major ( posterior ) GF patch , the additional anterior gaze following patches found in the left hemisphere of M2 only , overlapped with the MF face patch in this monkey . Interestingly , the weak anterior patch we had found for the opposite , 'identity matching vs gaze following' contrast , overlapped with anterior face patches: in M1 the unilateral identity patch on the lower bank of the STS around A17 right overlapped with the anterior lateral face patch ( AL ) in this monkey . In M2 the bilateral identity patches on the medial part of the STS around A22 overlapped with the anterior medial face patch ( AM ) . 3 Discussion We asked monkeys to use head gaze orientation of a portrayed conspecific to identify the spatial target the portrayed monkey was looking at , and to overtly shift attention to the same target . If cued by an alternative instruction , the same subjects exploited learned association between portrait identities and specific target locations to shift attention while ignoring gaze . Rather than to engage in geometrical head gaze following , the experimental animals might have learned to associate the head orientation of the portrayed monkey with particular target positions , either defined in absolute or in relative terms . We could rule out that the experimental animals relied on a workaround strategy based on such learned associations by presenting catch trials in behavioral control experiments in which spatial targets were presented in new associations with the portraits . In these catch trials , the experimental animals clearly preferred the target defined by head gaze of the portrayed monkey , rather than being misdirected to targets defined by one of the associations with portraits experienced in the training set . Hence , we can be sure that our experimental animals deployed geometrical head gaze following ( Emery et al . , 1997; Emery , 2000 ) . Using gaze direction rather than identity to shift attention was associated with a distinct patch of BOLD activity ( GF patch ) in a region of the posterior STS , on its lower bank around A1-P1 , near the dorsal end of the inferior temporal sulcus , corresponding to cytoarchitectonic area TEO ( Bonin and Bailey , 1947; Ungerleider and Desimone , 1986 ) and area PITd , the latter defined based on topographic and connectional data ( Felleman and Van Essen , 1991 ) . The location of the GF patch in this study is more posterior than BOLD activity , interpreted as being gaze following related , in two other monkeys used in a previous study by Kamphuis et al . ( 2009 ) . In that study , gaze following-related activity was found between A4 . 4-6 . 4 in one animal and A0 . 8-A3 . 3 in the other one . In other words , the anterior deviation of the location of the gaze following activity in the second monkey of Kamphuis et al . relative to the GF patch in the present study is not much larger than the interindividual differences in the present study ( M1:A0-P2 , M2: A2-P1 ) . Hence , we may safely assert agreement . The question is if the much more anterior location of gaze following-related BOLD activity in the first monkey studied by Kamphuis et al . is a reflection of more substantial interindividual variability or , alternatively , a consequence of a more fundamental difference between this monkey and the others . Actually , a limitation of the Kamphuis et al . study was that because of a lack of behavioral controls the authors could not exclude that the experimental animals might not have resorted to a workaround strategy based on learned associations between portraits and targets . Moreover , the two conditions compared in order to identify gaze following-related BOLD activity involved subtle visual differences . Hence , a possibility is that the pattern evoked in the Kamphuis et al . study may have been influenced by variables other than gaze following and we may speculate that these variables may have played a larger role in the odd monkey . Whereas in one monkey the GF patch could be delineated bilaterally in the STS in corresponding locations , much to our surprise , the gaze following-related activity in the other monkey was confined to the right hemisphere . Our attempts to lead this unilaterality back to differences in the quality of the MRI signal on the two sides or to differences in the behavior directed at the two sides , failed . Whatever the reason for the unilaterality may be , it seems specific to gaze following as testing the same monkey in a passive face perception task to delineate the face patch network did not reveal any major hemispheric differences . Previous behavioral studies on gaze following in healthy human subjects and patients with lesions ( Ricciardelli et al . , 2002; Akiyama et al . , 2006a , 2006b ) supports a specific role of the right hemisphere in gaze following and social cognition in general ( Brancucci et al . , 2009 for review ) . On the other hand , fMRI studies of gaze following in humans have yielded mixed results , with some showing mainly right hemisphere STS activation ( Pelphrey et al . , 2003 , 2004 , 2005; Calder et al . , 2007; Laube et al . , 2011 ) and others bilateral pSTS activation ( Puce et al . , 1998; Hoffman and Haxby , 2000; Materna et al . , 2008a , 2008b ) . Hence , it is tempting to see certain analogies between the human data and our monkey findings and to conclude that gaze following in monkeys and man may in principal be bihemispheric , though the substrates on the left side are deployed to individually varying degrees . The idea of true hemispheric differences in monkeys receives further support from the fact that the left STS of monkey M2 not only showed a GF patch with coordinates matching those of the patch in the right hemisphere but in addition two more anterior patches without equivalents in the right hemisphere of this monkey and none of the two hemispheres of monkey M1 . Actually , recent work on audio-vocal communication in macaque monkeys , emphasizing an advantage of the left hemisphere ( Heffner and Heffner , 1984; Ghazanfar and Hauser , 2001; Poremba et al . , 2004 ) , supports the idea that there is some hemispheric specialization in macaque monkeys . In any case , more subjects will have to be studied to decide if the seeming unilaterality in monkey M1 is more than an idiosyncrasy . Using the same face patch localizer paradigm as used in previous work ( Tsao et al . , 2003; Moeller et al . , 2008; Tsao et al . , 2008 ) , we delineated the set of face patches with comparable coordinates and spatial layout . The only difference with respect to the later studies of Tsao et al . ( Moeller et al . , 2008; Tsao et al . , 2008 ) was a somewhat weaker and less consistent activation of the anterior and posterior face patches . This difference is most probably a consequence of methodological differences: these later studies ( Moeller et al . , 2008; Tsao et al . , 2008 ) relied on MION-based measurements of activity-related changes in blood volume , well-known to be more sensitive by a factor of 3 than the BOLD method deployed by us , using the same 3T scanner ( Leite et al . , 2002 ) . Actually , when relying on BOLD imaging of the monkey face patch system and deploying a comparably high significance threshold , also an earlier study of Tsao et al . ( 2003 ) identified only a fraction of the face patches which were later demonstrated with MION . In this earlier study the strongest activity was found in the face patches in the fundus and lower bank of the middle STS ( corresponding to ML and MF in Moeller et al . , 2008; Tsao et al . , 2008 ) and the face-patch located in rostral TE ( corresponding to AL in Moeller et al . , 2008; Tsao et al . , 2008 ) . The patch in the STS in area TEO ( corresponding to PL in Moeller et al . , 2008; Tsao et al . , 2008 ) was not reliable across different days and other anterior face patches ( AF and AM ) were not reported . This pattern fits our results . Nevertheless , we clearly identified all the medial and posterior face patches described before ( Moeller et al . , 2008; Tsao et al . , 2008 ) which were in the vicinity of our GF patch . This is important as our major finding is the complete separation of the GF patch from any of the neighboring face patches with ML/MF being closest to the GF patch . The face patch system in monkeys is largely bilateral ( Tsao et al . , 2003 , 2008 ) . The fact that unlike face-related activity , the gaze following-related activity was unilateral in one of the two monkeys studied , further supports the notion of two distinct and anatomically separated systems . On the other hand , the two weak BOLD responses observed inconsistently much more anterior in conjunction with gaze following overlapped with the MF face patch . This overlap may suggest that MF may be more important for processing information on facial orientation than on facial identity . Physical proximity does not necessarily imply connectivity and close functional relationship . Yet , the properties of neurons in ML/MF are suggestive of a functional relationship: many face-selective cells are tuned to specific face ( =head ) orientations ( Freiwald et al . , 2009; Freiwald and Tsao , 2010 ) . This is exactly the kind of information head gaze following builds on . To identify the goal of the other one's gaze in the frame of reference of the observer or , alternatively , in a world-centered frame of reference shared by both agents , the spatial relationship of the two agents and the relationship of potential goal objects relative to the two agents needs to be taken into account also . Hence , it is intriguing to speculate that the GF patch could be the substrate of the geometrical calculations needed to establish this goal representation , to this end adding the required contextual information to the elementary face ( =head ) orientation information taken over from the ML/MF ( Freiwald et al . , 2009 ) . This idea receives additional support from the fact that microstimulation of parietal area LIP causes stimulation-induced BOLD responses in a part of the STS whose coordinates seem to correspond to those of our study GF patch ( Crapse et al . , 2013 ) . Area LIP is a well-established center of overt and covert shifts of attention guided by a wide variety of cues , including head gaze ( Shepherd et al . , 2009; Bisley et al . , 2011 ) . Using a comparable approach to delineate the cortical substrates of eye gaze following in humans , gaze following related BOLD activity was described bilaterally in the posterior STS ( 'pSTS region' ) ( Materna et al . , 2008a ) , later shown to be activated also by following other biological cues like finger pointing ( Materna et al . , 2008b ) and head orientation ( Laube et al . , 2011 ) . Importantly , presenting distracting eye gaze cue in conjunction with head gaze following led to a clear modulation of the BOLD signal in the pSTS ( Laube et al . , 2011 ) . We have not studied if changing eye orientation relative to the head changes gaze-related activity in the GF patch in monkeys . This must not be expected in view of the fact that monkeys seem to pay very little attention to the other one's eye when trying to establish joint attention . However , independent of the differing weights attributed to eye and head gaze in humans and monkeys , the geometrical calculations needed to pinpoint a spatial goal shared by the two interacting agents are comparable . This consideration may suggest that the regions in the monkey and human STS activated by gaze following are analogous and possibly even homologous . In contrast to the absence of overlap between the GF patch and the neighboring face patches , the BOLD activity related to the usage of facial identity for target localization in the anterior parts of the STS overlapped with activity evoked by the passive observation of faces . The identity-associated signal coincided with AM in M2 and AL in M1 . The anterior location of our identity matching BOLD activation fits the previous electrophysiological finding of identity-selective neurons in the anterior inferotemporal gyrus ( Hasselmo et al . , 1989; Eifuku et al . , 2004; Freiwald and Tsao , 2010 ) . In accordance with the notion that these patches are involved in establishing facial identity , it was recently demonstrated that the percept of facial identity is disrupted by microstimulation of AM ( and ML ) face patches ( Moeller and Tsao , 2013 ) . In summary , by requiring monkeys to use head gaze to locate spatial targets we could identify a highly specific region in the posterior STS ( GF patch ) well separated from those parts of the STS known to process visual information on faces and heads . We propose that this region corresponds to the pSTS of humans devoted to eye gaze following . We furthermore suggest that this region may be the substrate of the geometrical calculations needed to translate head orientation into precise shifts of attention . 4 Materials and methods Two rhesus monkeys ( Macaca mulatta ) : monkey M1 ( 6 years , 8 kg ) ; monkey M2 ( 8 years , 11 kg ) were implanted with three cf-PEEK ( carbon-fiber-enforced polyetheretherketone ) tripods , each attached to the skull with six ceramic screws ( Thomas Recording ) . Surgeries were carried out under combination anesthesia with isoflurane and remifentanyl with monitoring of all relevant vital parameters ( body temperature , CO2 , blood oxygen saturation , blood pressure , ECG ) . After surgery , monkeys were supplied with opioid analgesics ( buprenorphin ) until they fully recovered . Every effort was made to minimize discomfort and suffering . The study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health . All of the animals were handled according to the guidelines of the German law regulating the usage of experimental animals and the protocols approved by the local institution in charge of experiments using animals ( Regierungspraesidium Tuebingen , Abteilung Tierschutz , permit-number N1/08 ) . The monkeys were placed in an MR-compatible primate chair in a horizontal ( 'sphinx' ) posture . To immobilize the monkey's head , it was fixed to the chair by screwing the tripods to an acryl cap with an integrated massive cf-PEEK rod , which then was connected to the chair's frame . Before scanning they were trained in a mock scanner having the same geometry , projection screen and offering a similar acoustic environment as the real scanner . Hearing protection was guaranteed in the mock as well as in the real scanner by custom-made earmuffs with thick plastic foam filling . Habituating and subsequently training on the behavioral tasks took 6 months in M2 and 1 year in M1 until the mean accuracy scores in each task for the training session reached 80% . Eye position was tracked in real time using a scanner-compatible low-cost CMOS-infra-red camera ( C-MOS-Kameramodul1 ( C-CAM-A ) , Conrad Elektronik , Germany ) with infra-red emitting LEDs illuminating the monkey's eyes . The custom-made software running on a standard PC determined orientation of the center of the pupil with a spatial resolution of 0 . 5° visual angle and a temporal resolution of 50 Hz . Camera and power supply cables were equipped with radio frequency ( RF ) -eliminating filters to minimize RF interactions in the real scanner ( Kamphuis et al . , 2009 ) . Fluid rewards were supplied via a long and flexible tube , with the control unit , valve and reservoir installed outside the scanner room . Monkeys were scanned in a horizontal clinical scanner , 3T MRT ( Trio , Siemens , Erlangen , Germany ) . Functional images were acquired using two custom-made linear receiver surface coils ( diameter 13 cm , 'Helmholtz-configuration'; whole-brain scanning in M1 and STS-ROI scanning in M2 , later referred as 'bilateral coil' ) or one small surface coil ( diameter 3 cm; STS-ROI scanning in M2 and additional left STS-ROI scanning in M1 , later referred as 'focal coil' ) , placed above the temporal lobe ( centered on the posterior STS ) . Each functional time series consisted of gradient-echoplanar whole-brain images ( repetition time ( TR ) = 2000 ms; echo time ( TE ) = 28 ms; flip angle = 70°; 64 × 64 matrix; 1 . 31 × 2 . 42 × 1 . 31 mm voxels; 22 horizontal slices ) or STS-ROI images ( repetition time ( TR ) = 1000 ms; echo time ( TE ) = 28 ms: flip angle = 70°; 64 × 64 matrix; 1 . 31 × 2 . 42 × 1 . 31 mm voxels; 11 horizontal slices ) . For the purpose of the first experiment ( 'gaze following' paradigm ) 10 , 364 whole brain volumes in 80 functional runs ( see 'Visual stimuli' section for definition of a single functional run ) were scanned in six scanning sessions ( separate days of measurement ) in monkey M1 , using the bilateral coil . Additionally , 4400 STS volumes were scanned ( 55 functional runs , 2 scanning sessions ) using the focal coil , centered on the left posterior STS in M1 . In M2 a total of 12 , 280 right STS volumes were scanned in 75 functional runs: 6276 vol in 36 functional runs during 3 scanning sessions using the focal coil and 6004 in 39 functional runs during 3 scanning sessions with the bilateral coil . A total of 10 , 501 left STS volumes were scanned in 67 functional runs ( 4497 vol in 28 functional runs during 3 scanning sessions using the focal coil; 6004 vol in 39 functional runs during 3 scanning sessions with the bilateral coil ) . In the second experiment ( 'passive face perception' paradigm ) a total of 4626 vol were scanned in 28 functional runs ( 3 scanning sessions ) in M1 using whole-brain volumes and the bilateral coil . In M2 a total of 6106 STS volumes in 29 functional runs during 3 scanning sessions were collected from the right hemisphere ( 2724 vol in 13 functional runs during 1 scanning session using the focal coil; 3382 vol in 16 functional runs during 2 scanning sessions using the bilateral coil ) and a total of 6297 STS volumes in 30 functional runs during 3 scanning sessions on the left hemisphere ( 2915 vol in 14 functional runs during 1 scanning session using the focal coil; 3382 vol in 16 functional runs during 2 scanning sessions using the bilateral coil ) ."}

We often eat not simply because we are hungry , but because we have learned to eat at specific times of day or in response to factors in our environments ( for example , an advert that reminds of us of something tasty ) . Despite this , few researchers have investigated how biological signals from the gut communicate with the brain to enable this type of learned , or “conditioned” , feeding behavior . Brain cells called neurons communicate with each other in specific circuits that can cross between different brain regions . Hsu et al . have now developed a “disconnection neuropharmacology” approach , which alters whether the neurons in different brain regions can communicate with each other , to investigate the effects signaling molecules have on brain activity and behavior . Using this approach in rats revealed a new circuit in the brain that controls learned feeding behavior through ghrelin , a hormone that is released from the stomach and increases appetite . Hsu et al . found that the hippocampus , a brain region important for learning and memory control , uses ghrelin as a signal to engage in learned feeding behavior . Neurons in the hippocampus that respond to ghrelin communicate with other neurons in a region of the brain called the lateral hypothalamus ( known for its role in feeding ) that produce a signaling molecule called orexin . This circuit therefore links memory and feeding behavior . Future work will investigate the neural circuits between the hippocampus and other brain regions that are important for feeding behavior , and the hormones that are important for triggering activity in these circuits .", "article": "1 Introduction Feeding behavior rarely occurs as a direct result of an immediate metabolic or nutrient deficiency . Rather , most animals ( including humans ) have habitual feeding patterns , consuming a fixed number of meals at approximately the same time each day . Environmental stimuli associated with learned meal anticipation elicit preparatory biological ‘cephalic’ responses ( e . g . , pancreatic insulin release ) that occur prior to food consumption ( Woods and Ramsay , 2000; Woods et al . , 1970 ) . These types of conditioned biological responses are advantageous when environmental factors place constraints on eating ( e . g . , predator threat , limited periods of food availability , and social or professional obligations ) because they promote consumption of a large quantity of food within a relatively short time period . One important biological signal associated with conditioned appetite and feeding is ghrelin , a hormone derived from P/D1 cells in the stomach that is the only known circulating hormone that increases food intake ( Tschöp et al . , 2000; Cowley et al . , 2003 ) . While often referred to as a ‘hunger’ hormone , ghrelin is perhaps more aptly described as a meal-anticipatory hormone based on findings from both humans and rodents showing that ghrelin levels rise before an anticipated feeding bout independent of energy deprivation levels ( Frecka and Mattes , 2008; Cummings et al . , 2001; Drazen et al . , 2006 ) . Genetic deletion of the ghrelin receptor ( growth hormone secretagogue receptor 1A; GHSR ) eliminates food anticipatory activity under meal entrainment feeding schedules ( Blum et al . , 2009; Davis et al . , 2011 ) , further supporting the notion that ghrelin acts as a conditioned meal-anticipatory signal . The mechanisms through which ghrelin communicates with the central nervous system to control learned aspects of food intake regulation are poorly understood . The hippocampus is a brain region historically associated with visuospatial and episodic memory function that has more recently been linked with the control of various feeding-relevant behaviors ( Benoit et al . , 2010; Davidson et al . , 2007; Kanoski , 2012; Parent et al . , 2014 ) , including conditioned meal anticipation ( Poulin and Timofeeva , 2008; Inglis et al . , 1994; Henderson et al . , 2013 ) . GHSR is expressed abundantly in hippocampal neurons ( Mani et al . , 2014 ) , and we recently demonstrated that pharmacological activation of GHSR by ghrelin in ventral/temporal subregions of the hippocampus ( vHP ) potently stimulates food intake by increasing both meal frequency and meal size ( Kanoski et al . , 2013 ) . However , the extent to which endogenous vHP GHSR signaling controls conditioned anticipatory feeding behavior has not been investigated . The lateral hypothalamic area ( LHA ) is implicated in the control of fundamental motivated behaviors , including food intake ( For review see: [Stanley et al . , 2011; Leinninger , 2011; Berthoud and Münzberg , 2011] ) . Classic studies show that LHA electrical ablation results in profound hypophagia ( Teitelbaum and Epstein , 1962; Anand and Brobeck , 1951 ) , whereas LHA electrical stimulation robustly increases food intake ( Delgado and Anand , 1953 ) . The LHA has direct connections with brain regions involved in the regulation of energy balance , including the hypothalamic arcuate and paraventricular nuclei ( Hahn and Swanson , 2015 ) , and the medial nucleus of the solitary tract ( Ciriello et al . , 2013 ) . In addition , the LHA is also directly connected with several brain regions that regulate ‘higher-order’ cognitive aspects of feeding behavior , including the vHP , amygdala , nucleus accumbens ( ACB ) , and ventral tegmental area ( VTA ) ( Hahn and Swanson , 2015; Hahn and Swanson , 2010; Cenquizca and Swanson , 2006; Hahn and Swanson , 2012; Goto et al . , 2005 ) . Of note , vHP pyramidal neurons in field CA1 and the subiculum are a major source of direct and exclusively ipsilateral input to the LHA , especially the dorsal perifornical LHA ( dpLHA ) ( Hahn and Swanson , 2015; Cenquizca and Swanson , 2006; Hahn and Swanson , 2012; Kishi et al . , 2000 ) . The dpLHA also has abundant expression of the neuropeptide orexin ( ORX/hypocretin ) ( Swanson et al . , 2005; Hahn , 2010 ) , which in addition to an established role in behavioral arousal ( Hagan et al . , 1999; Chemelli et al . , 1999 ) , also has a central orexigenic role in the control of ingestive behavior ( Willie et al . , 2001; Rodgers et al . , 2002; Sakurai , 2014; Thorpe et al . , 2005; Sweet et al . , 2004; Olszewski et al . , 2009 ) . We hypothesize that LHA ORX neurons are a critical downstream substrate of vHP ghrelinergic appetitive neural responding , because [1] orexin receptor 1 ( Ox1R ) signaling is required for ventricular ghrelin-induced hyperphagia ( Cone et al . , 2014 ) , and [2] LHA ORX neurons are activated in anticipation of feeding under meal entrainment schedules ( Jiménez et al . , 2013 ) . In the present study we investigate the neural substrates through which ghrelin communicates conditioned appetite and feeding behavior to and within the brain . We hypothesize the existence of a neural pathway whereby peripherally-derived ghrelin ( secreted in anticipation of feeding ) activates GHSR-expressing vHP glutamatergic ( pyramidal ) neurons , which in turn activate orexin-expressing dpLHA neurons to stimulate appetite and feeding via CNS Ox1R signaling . We employed a combination of methods to facilitate a correlative approach , including neural pathway-tracing , immunohistochemistry , behavioral neuropharmacology , meal entrainment conditioning , and excitotoxic unilateral lesion-mediated neural ‘disconnection’ between pharmacological vHP GHSR activation and the dpLHA . The results of these experiments suggest novel mechanisms linking mnemonic processes with gut-brain communication to control feeding behavior . 2 Results Figure 1 depicts a representative 100nl vHP injection site . Rats restricted to 4 hr chow access per day ( meal entrainment schedule ) learned to gradually increase their chow consumption over the 8 day training period ( significant main effect of Day , p<0 . 01 ) ( Figure 2A ) . Bilateral parenchymal delivery of the selective GHSR antagonist , JMV2959 ( 10 μg ) to vHP neurons significantly reduced 4 hr chow intake in meal-entrained rats ( p<0 . 05; Figure 2B ) . However , the same dose of JMV2959 had no effect on 4 hr rebound feeding following 20 hr food restriction in control rats that were not meal entrained ( Figure 2C ) . Moreover , the JMV2959-induced intake reduction observed in meal-entrained rats appears to be specific to conditioned feeding behavior as opposed to being based on higher baseline kcal consumption in meal entrained vs . control rats . This is supported by results showing that vHP JMV2959 administration did not reduce 4 hr Western diet intake in non-meal entrained , non-food restricted rats under conditions in which total kcal intake exceeded levels observed in meal-entrained rats ( Figure 2D ) . Collectively these findings indicate that endogenous vHP ghrelin signaling is critical in the control of conditioned feeding behavior . 10 . 7554/eLife . 11190 . 003Figure 1 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 11190 . 005 Like the vHP , the LHA is another brain region that expresses GHSR , and activation of these receptors increases feeding ( Mani et al . , 2014; Olszewski et al . , 2003 ) , Moreover , orexin-producing neurons in the LHA are activated by external food-related cues and by LHA administration of ghrelin ( Olszewski et al . , 2003; Petrovich et al . , 2012 ) . Thus , to determine whether endogenous LHA ghrelin signaling also contributes to conditioned feeding responses , we repeated the meal entrainment and non-entrained , 20 hr food deprivation procedures in LHA cannulated rats . Animals restricted to 4 hr chow access per day again learned to increase their chow consumption over the 8 day training period ( significant main effect of Day , p<0 . 01 ) ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1A ) . Bilateral delivery of JMV2959 had no effect on 4 hr chow intake in meal entrained rats , nor did LHA JMV2959 application influence 4 hr chow intake in 20 hr food deprived , non-meal entrained rats ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1B , C ) . These findings suggest that unlike vHP ghrelin signaling , LHA ghrelin signaling does appear to be critical for the manifestation of conditioned feeding behavior . A vHP to LHA pathway hypothesized to play a role in GHSR signaling for the control of conditioned feeding behavior , was investigated using retrograde pathway-tracing and immunohistochemistry . Following injection of either Fluorogold or cholera toxin B subunit ( CTB ) into the dpLHA , abundant exclusively ipsilateral retrograde labeling was seen in the vHP field CA1 and subiculum ( i . e . , no Fluorogold- or CTB-immunoreactive cells were observed in the ventral CA1 contralateral to tracer injections ) , consistent with previous findings ( Hahn and Swanson , 2010; Hahn and Swanson , 2012; Cenquizca and Swanson , 2006 ) . Further investigation of CTB and Fluorogold retrogradely-labeled vHP neurons found that most were also immunoreactive for GHSR [representative dpLHA CTB injection site depicted in Figure 3A; retrogradely-labeled CTB immunoreactive soma in the vHP depicted in Figure 3C; inset location delineated in Figure 3B] . Consistent with previous literature revealing extensive GHSR mRNA expression in the vHP CA fields ( Mani et al . , 2014; Zigman et al . , 2006 ) , our immunohistochemistry analyses confirmed robust GHSR protein expression in vHP CA1 pyramidal neurons ( Figure 3D ) . Quantification of the percentage of back-labeled CTB and Fluorogold immunoreactive soma also expressing GHSR revealed 84 . 11% ( SEM = 0 . 07 ) colocalization in rats injected with CTB in the LHA , and 86 . 22% ( SEM = 0 . 03 ) colocalization in rats that were injected with Fluorogold in the LHA ( representative CTB and GHSR co-labeled soma depicted in Figure 2E ) . These data indicate that the vast majority of vHP neurons that provide an ipsilateral input to the dpLHA also express GHSR . 10 . 7554/eLife . 11190 . 006Figure 3 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 11190 . 006 To explore the functional relevance of the exclusively unilateral vHP to dpLHA communication in vHP ghrelin-mediated hyperphagia , rats with unilateral excitotoxic ( NMDA ) or sham lesions in the dpLHA were implanted with bilateral vHP-targeted cannulae ( representative unilateral dpLHA lesion depicted in Figure 4 with NeuN immunohistochemistry ) . Food intake was measured after unilateral vHP administration of ghrelin ( 300 pmol ) to rats with dpLHA lesions or sham lesions that were either ipsilateral or contralateral to the side of ghrelin administration ( i . e . vHP to LHA communication either eliminated or intact ) . Ghrelin delivered to the vHP contralateral to the LHA lesion ( or sham lesion ) significantly increased chow intake in both groups , whereas ghrelin delivered to the vHP ipsilateral to the LHA lesion ( or sham lesion ) significantly increased food intake only in the Sham group ( Figure 5A–D; *indicates p<0 . 05 vs . vehicle treatment , Ŧ indicates p<0 . 07 vs . vehicle treatment ) . A repeated-measures overall ANOVA was also performed with ‘lesion group’ as a between subjects variable and ‘drug’ as a repeated measures variable . There was no overall significant ‘group’ effect on food intake at any point , whereas the overall ‘drug’ effect was significant at all time points ( p<0 . 001 ) . Furthermore , there was a significant interaction between ‘group’ and ‘drug’ at the 5 hr time point [F ( 1 , 15 ) =4 . 93 , p<0 . 05] , whereas this interaction just missed significance at the 1 hr and 3 hr time points . These results show that vHP neural communication with the dpLHA is required for vHP ghrelin-mediated feeding effects . 10 . 7554/eLife . 11190 . 007Figure 4 .

PHAL was injected by iontophoresis into the vHP field CA1 ( representative injection site depicted in Figure 6A ) . Double-label immunohistochemistry for PHAL and ORX revealed several instances of PHAL-labeled axons with numerous varicosities in close apposition to ORX-expressing neurons within the dpLHA ( representative examples shown in Figure 6C , inset location delineated in Figure 6B ) . Subsequent triple-label immunohistochemistry for PHAL , ORX , and the presynaptic marker synaptophysin indicated that the apparent terminal appositions were putative sites of synaptic input from vHP CA1 neurons to ORX-expressing neurons ( representative examples shown in Figure 6D ) . These data confirm an input to the dpLHA from the vHP field CA1 , and indicate further that this input targets ORX-expressing neurons . 10 . 7554/eLife . 11190 . 009Figure 6 . vHP CA1 neurons provide input to dpLHA ORX-expressing neurons .

Immediately afterwards , the rats received unilateral parenchymal vHP injections of ghrelin ( 300 pmol ) or vehicle on separate test days . Treatments were counter-balanced using a within-subjects design . Ghrelin significantly increased chow intake in rats pretreated with vehicle in the LV , but had no effect relative to vehicle on intake in rats pretreated with SB334867 ( Figure 8A , B; *indicates p<0 . 05 vs . vehicle treatment , Ŧ indicates p<0 . 07 vs . vehicle treatment ) . These data indicate that vHP-mediated feeding effects involve downstream Ox1R signaling . 10 . 7554/eLife . 11190 . 012Figure 8 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 11190 . 012 3 Discussion Ghrelin levels rise in anticipation of feeding ( Frecka and Mattes , 2008; Cummings et al . , 2001; Drazen et al . , 2006 ) and ghrelin receptor null mice show blunted meal anticipatory responding under meal entrainment feeding schedules ( Blum et al . , 2009; Davis et al . , 2011 ) . Compared to equivalent levels of food restriction , the anticipation of eating in meal entrained rats had a greater stimulatory effect on ghrelin release ( Drazen et al . , 2006 ) , indicating that ghrelin acts as a meal anticipation hormonal signal that facilitates the consumption of large quantities of food . This notion is also consistent with data showing a role for ghrelin in stimulating gastric motility ( Masuda et al . , 2000; Peeters , 2003 ) and increasing meal size ( Kanoski et al . , 2013; Lee et al . , 2011; Swartz et al . , 2014; de Lartigue et al . , 2010; Faulconbridge et al . , 2003 ) . Here we identify and characterize a novel neural substrate extending these previous findings by demonstrating that vHP ghrelin signaling is physiologically relevant for conditioned feeding behavior . After exposure to a meal entrainment schedule in which rats were restricted to 4 hr food access each day , pharmacological blockade of vHP GHSR signaling prior to food access significantly reduced 4 hr chow consumption . Comparatively , vHP GHSR blockade had no effect on a 4 hr chow intake in equally food-restricted rats that had not undergone the meal entrainment learning . Moreover , the intake reduction appears to be specific to conditioned feeding behavior as opposed to being based on higher baseline kcal consumption in meal entrained vs . control rats . This is supported by results showing that vHP JMV2959 administration did not reduce Western diet intake in non-food deprived , non-meal entrained animals under conditions where baseline kcal intake of the Western diet was actually higher than in meal-entrained rats consuming chow . However , another study showed that peripheral GHSR antagonist ( Compound 26 ) delivery failed to suppress feeding in meal-entrained mice ( Perello et al . , 2010 ) , yet we note that this previous study utilized a different GHSR antagonist , a different species , and a different route of administration ( peripheral ) . Collectively , these findings build on previous work showing that pharmacological vHP GHSR activation increases meal frequency and size ( Kanoski et al . , 2013 ) . Here we establish the endogenous relevance of vHP GHSR signaling to a specific component of feeding – conditioned feeding . We hypothesize that pharmacologically induced hyperphagia following vHP ghrelin injections occurs , at least in part , by augmenting the saliency of conditioned food-relevant interoceptive stimuli and/or external cues that are present in the environment . To investigate neural pathways downstream to vHP ghrelin-mediated feeding behavior , we focused on the dpLHA region that contains abundant ORX-expressing neurons ( Swanson et al . , 2005; Hahn , 2010 ) , and provide evidence of an input to dpLHA ORX-expressing from GHSR-expressing neurons in the vHP ( field CA1 ) . Our data confirm the existence of an exclusively ipsilateral direct input to the dpLHA from the vHP field CA1 , and further demonstrate that ~85% of vHP field CA1 neurons retrogradely labeled from the dpLHA are immunoreactive for GHSR . These findings suggest that vCA1 ghrelin-responsive neurons send a direct input to the dpLHA , thereby highlighting the dpLHA as a downstream target for vHP ghrelin-mediated feeding . Based on research showing an extensive population of orexin producing neurons in the dpLHA ( Swanson et al . , 2005; Hahn , 2010; Sakurai et al . , 1998; Chen et al . , 1999 ) , as well as functional and neuroanatomical interactions between ghrelin and Ox1R signaling ( Cone et al . , 2014; Olszewski et al . , 2003; Perello et al . , 2010; Solomon et al . , 2007; Toshinai et al . , 2003 ) , we next investigated the relationship between vCA1 and dpLHA orexin neurons . A direct connection from the vHP to dpLHA neurons was confirmed by the presence of PHAL-immunoreactive axons in the dpLHA following vHP field CA1 PHAL injections . Several instances of PHAL-labeled axons with varicosities and terminal boutons were recorded in close apposition to dpLHA ORX-expressing neurons . Triple-labeling for PHAL , ORX and the presynaptic marker synaptophysin indicated that some of these close appositions were putative sites of synaptic input . Next , we tested whether vHP GHSR activation engages dpLHA orexin neurons . Immunohistochemical analysis of Fos and orexin expression in the dpLHA in rats treated with vHP ghrelin or vehicle injections revealed Fos expression in approximately 70% of dpLHA orexin-expressing neurons . Taken together , these findings indicate a functional pathway involving GHSR-expressing vHP field CA1 neurons and their downstream communication to dpLHA orexin neurons . To investigate the functional relevance of a putative vHP field CA1 ghrelin to LHA orexin connection further , we combined behavioral neuropharmacology ( vHP ghrelin injection ) with an excitotoxic unilateral LHA lesion-mediated neural disconnection approach ( adapted after [Petrovich et al . , 2002] ) . This approach takes advantage of an exclusively ipsilateral connection between the vHP and the LHA . Results show that vHP ghrelin administration ipsilateral to unilateral LHA lesions ( vHP GHSR to LHA communication eliminated ) blocks vHP ghrelin-activated hyperphagia that occurs in rats with sham lesions , and that also occurs when vHP ghrelin injections are given contralateral to the unilateral dpLHA lesion ( vHP GHSR to LHA communication intact ) . These data indicate that vHP to dpLHA communication is critical for vHP ghrelin-mediated feeding effects . A limitation in interpreting these findings with regard to the control of conditioned feeding behavior is that these experiments utilized pharmacological activation of vHP ghrelin receptors during free feeding conditions , and therefore the endogenous relevance of this neural circuitry during conditioned or entrained feeding requires further research . However , our data from Exp . 1 provide strong support for the endogenous relevance of vHP ghrelin signaling system for conditioned food intake . We hypothesize that the robust hyperphagic response following vHP GHSR activation during free feeding conditions is based , at least in part , on pharmacologically activating conditioned feeding behavior in the presence of food-associated cues . In other words , pharmacological vHP GHSR activation is potentially bolstering the saliency of internal ( e . g . , circadian , metabolic ) or external cues within the animal’s environment ( e . g . , food hopper ) that have the capacity to promote feeding behavior based on learned associations with feeding . Consistent with this framework , vHP GHSR activation increases meal frequency in response to external environmental stimuli ( auditory , visual ) that were associated with palatable food access , whereas vHP ghrelin signaling does not augment feeding in response to control stimuli with no prior food association ( Kanoski et al . , 2013 ) . However , because present data do not directly assess the functional importance of vHP ghrelin to LHA orexin neural circuitry in conditioned feeding , we acknowledge that this pathway might also mediate aspects of non-conditioned appetite and feeding behavior . Indeed , ghrelin signaling in other brains regions appears to stimulate non-conditioned appetitive responding ( Skibicka et al . , 2011; Skibicka et al . , 2013 ) . For example , ICV or intra-amydala administration of the same GHSR antagonist used in this study ( JMV2959 ) reduces free feeding in fasted ( non-entrained ) animals ( Salomé et al . , 2009; Alvarez-Crespo et al . , 2012 ) . Neurons in the LHA also express GHSR , and LHA orexin-producing neurons are activated by external food-related cues as well as by direct LHA ghrelin administration ( Olszewski et al . , 2003; Petrovich et al . , 2012 ) . These findings suggest that in addition to the vHP , the LHA might also be a target for ghrelinergic conditioned feeding responses . However , our present data reveal that intra-LHA JMV2959 ( including a dose that was effective in the vHP ) had no effect on food intake in meal-entrained and non-meal-entrained animals , suggesting that while ghrelin signaling in various brain regions stimulates non-conditioned feeding behavior , vHP ghrelin signaling is a potentially unique neural substrate for learned aspects of feeding behavior . We note that it is also possible that vHP ghrelin to LHA orexin neural circuitry mediates non-conditioned aspects of feeding , however , this notion requires further investigation . Our neuroanatomical data are consistent with previous research showing that vHP output to the LHA primarily targets the dpLHA region ( Hahn and Swanson , 2010; Hahn and Swanson , 2012; Kishi et al . , 2000 ) that was targeted with our unilateral NMDA lesions . While the anatomical and behavioral data in the current study suggest that vHP neurons communicate ghrelinergic signaling to the dpLHA directly , we recognize that multisynaptic pathways are also likely be involved . In addition to providing an input to the LHA , vHP field CA1 neurons also provide an input to several other feeding-related brain regions , including the amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex ( mPFC ) ( Ishikawa and Nakamura , 2006; Cenquizca and Swanson , 2007 ) . These regions also provide a topographically organized input to the LHA ( Hahn and Swanson , 2015; Hahn and Swanson , 2012 ) , and neural connectivity between the amygdala-LHA and mPFC-LHA has been shown to be critical for conditioned cue-potentiated feeding ( Petrovich et al . , 2002; Petrovich et al . , 2005 ) . Additional studies are required to determine the functional relevance of these other pathways to vHP ghrelin-mediated appetite . We examined the requirement of downstream Ox1R signaling for vHP ghrelin-mediated feeding effects , demonstrating that central Ox1R blockade ( via LV injections of an Ox1R antagonist ) attenuated the hyperphagic effects of vHP ghrelin signaling . However , because ventricular injections spread throughout the CNS and Ox1R s are expressed throughout the brain , ( Hervieu et al . , 2001; Marcus et al . , 2001 ) , we can only speculate as to the mediating sites of Ox1R activation . Recent research has shown that blockade of Ox1Rs in the VTA attenuates food intake induced by LV ghrelin ( Cone et al . , 2014 ) . Given these findings , and the role of VTA dopaminergic signaling in various aspects of feeding behavior ( Cone et al . , 2014; Skibicka et al . , 2013; Nieh et al . , 2015; Liu and Borgland , 2015; Narayanan et al . , 2010; Cacciapaglia et al . , 2011 ) , we hypothesize that VTA Ox1R signaling is a critical downstream target of vHP ghrelin to dpLHA orexin signaling , however , this remains to be tested . Previous literature has also shown that central orexin signaling has roles in sleep/wake and arousal in addition to regulating feeding behavior ( Hagan et al . , 1999; Chemelli et al . , 1999 ) . The current study did not directly assess the relationship between vHP ghrelin signaling and orexin mediated arousal . It is possible that the enhanced saliency of external food-related cues following vHP ghrelin signaling is mediated by increased arousal , as well as potential changes to circadian activity , from downstream activation of central Ox1R's ( possibly in the locus coeruleus ) . Further studies are required to test these possibilities , as well as the role of downstream Ox1R signaling in other aspects of feeding behavior ( Zhu et al . , 2002; Goforth et al . , 2014; Zheng et al . , 2007; Parise et al . , 2011; Harris et al . , 2005; Cason and Aston-Jones , 2013; Thorpe and Kotz , 2005; Thorpe et al . , 2006 ) . Based on the present results and the findings of related previous research , we propose the following model in which vHP ghrelin signaling engages conditioned feeding behavior ( Figure 9 ) : [1] Ghrelin is secreted from the stomach in response to cues ( internal or external ) related to meal anticipation , [2] Ghrelin crosses the blood brain barrier and enters the central nervous system , [3] vHP GHSR-expressing neurons are activated by ghrelin , [4] These vHP ghrelin-activated neurons engage downstream dpLHA orexin-expressing neurons , [5] Activation of this neural pathway increases appetite and feeding behavior . Together , our data highlight novel neurobiological mechanisms by which ghrelin engages higher-order brain circuitry , that in turn controls hypothalamic systems necessary for the regulation of appetite . 10 . 7554/eLife . 11190 . 013Figure 9 .

Louis , MO ) on either 12 hr:12 hr light/dark cycle ( lights on at 8:00 AM ) or 12:12 hr reverse light/dark cycle ( lights off at 10:00AM ) . For all surgical procedures , rats were anesthetized ( ketamine 90mg/kg and xylazine , 2 . 8 mg/kg ) , and sedated ( acepromazine . 0 . 72 mg/kg ) . All procedures were approved by the Institute of Animal Care and Use Committee , at the University of Southern California . Experiments involving central drug injections were as follows: ( Exp . 1 ) bilateral vHP injection of a ghrelin receptor ( GHSR ) antagonist ( JMV2959 , EMD Millipore , Billerica , MA ) ; ( Exp . 3 ) unilateral dpLHA injections of NMDA ( Sigma-Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) ; ( Exp . 3 and 5 ) unilateral vHP injection of ghrelin ( Bachem , Torrance , CA ) ; ( Exp . 6 ) bilateral vHP injection of ghrelin and lateral ventricle injection of an orexin receptor type 1 ( Ox1R ) antagonist ( SB334867 , Tocris Bioscience , Ellisville , MO ) . Drugs were dissolved in artificial cerebrospinal fluid ( aCSF ) , except SB334867 which was dissolved in DMSO . Drugs were delivered using a microinfusion pump ( Harvard Apparatus , Holliston , MA ) connected to a 33-gauge microsyringe injector , via indwelling guide cannulae . Flow rate was calibrated and set to 5 µl/min; injection volume was 100 nl/hemisphere for Exp . 1 , 3 and 6 . Injection volume for NMDA lesions were 200 nl ( dose: 4 μg ) . Ventricular injections in Exp . 6 were 1 ul in volume . Injectors were left in place for 30 sec post-injection . Guide cannulae ( 26-gauge , Plastics One , Roanoke , VA ) for bilateral vHP drug injections were implanted at the following stereotaxic coordinates ( Paxinos and Watson , 2007 ) : -4 . 9 mm anterior/posterior ( AP ) , 4 . 8 mm medial/lateral ( ML ) , 6 . 1 mm dorsal/ventral ( DV ) ; they were then affixed to the skull with jewelers screws . Coordinates for lateral ventricular injections of Ox1R antagonist SB334867 were -0 . 9 mm AP , 1 . 8 mm ML , 2 . 6 mm DV . Coordinates for excitotoxic ( 4 ug , NMDA , 200 nl ) LHA lesions , were -2 . 9 mm AP , 1 . 1 mm ML , -8 . 9 mm DV . Injectors for drug administration projected 2 mm beyond guide cannulae . Coordinates for LHA injections were -2 . 9 mm AP , +/- 1 . 0 mm ML , -6 . 7 mm DV . Placement of vHP and LHA cannulae placement was determined post-mortem by injection ( via guide cannulae ) of a blue dye ( 100 nl 2% pontamine sky blue ink ) . Data from animals with dye restricted to the vHP were included in the analysis ( a representative vHP injection site is shown in Figure 1 ) . In total , 12% of rats with vHP cannulae were excluded from the analysis because of misplaced cannulae , determined by the presence of blue dye as noted above . The extent of unilateral NMDA dpLHA-targeted lesions was determined postmortem by immunohistochemical detection of the neuronal marker NeuN . Rats showing pronounced ( 65% ) loss of NeuN labeling within the dpLHA compared to a contralateral sham ( aCSF ) injection in the same animal were included in data analysis ( two rats with minimal or misplaced lesions were excluded ) . Targeting of the OX1R antagonist SB334867 to the lateral ventricle ( Exp . 6 ) was verified 1 week post-injection of the antagonist by elevation of cytoglucopenia resulting from injection ( at the same coordinates ) of 210 μg ( 2 μl ) of 5-thio-D-glucose ( Ritter et al . , 1981 ) . A post-injection elevation of at least 100% of baseline glycemia was required for subject inclusion ( 1 rat was excluded ) . Experiments involving neural pathway-tracing were as follows: ( Exp . 2 ) Retrograde tracing from the dpLHA following unilateral pressure injection of either Fluorogold ( FG , Fluorochrome LLC , Denver , CO; 2% in 0 . 9% NaCl ) , or cholera toxin B subunit conjugated to ( red fluorophore ) Alexa Fluor 594 ( CTB-AF594 , 0 . 25% in 0 . 9% NaCl , Life Technologies , Carlsbad , CA; Cat . No . C-22842 ) . Pressure injections were performed using a microinfusion pump as described above; injection volumes were 100 nl ( Exp . 4 ) . Anterograde tracing from the vHP field CA1 following unilateral iontophoretic injection of Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin ( PHAL , Vector Labs , Burlingame , CA; 2 . 5% in 0 . 1 M sodium phosphate-buffered saline , pH 7 . 4 ) was performed using a precision current source ( digital midgard precision current source , Stoelting ) as described previously ( Hahn and Swanson , 2010 ) . PHAL immunoreactive axons in the LHA confirmed the exclusively ipsilateral nature of vHP to LHA projections ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1; representative vHP PHAL injection site , Figure 6 ) . Experiments 2–5 included immunohistochemical ( IHC ) analyses . Animals were anesthetized , then perfused transcardially with ice-cooled 0 . 9% saline , followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0 . 1 M borate buffer of pH 9 . 5 . The brains were removed and immersed in the same ( unused ) fixative containing 12% sucrose for 20–24 hr at 4ºC . The brains were then blocked transversely at the level of the caudal midbrain , and each block was flash-frozen in dry-ice cooled hexane before being sectioned frozen on a sliding microtome ( transverse plane , 30 µm thickness , 5 series ) . Sections were stored in antifreeze solution at -20°C until further processing ( Antifreeze solution: 30% ethylene glycol , 20% glycerol in 0 . 02 M potassium phosphate-buffered saline—KPBS ) . The following primary antibodies were used: ( Exp . 2 ) anti-CTB ( raised in goat ) and anti-GHSR ( goat ) ; ( Exp . 4 ) anti-PHAL ( goat ) , anti-ORX1a ( rabbit ) , and anti-synaptophysin ( mouse ) ; ( Exp . 5 ) anti-cFos ( sheep ) and anti-ORX1a ( rabbit ) . Antibody incubations were done at 4ºC ( washes and other steps at room temperature ) . Primary antibody incubation was overnight ( ~18 hrs ) . Primary antibodies were diluted in the following solution: KPBS containing 1% donkey serum and 0 . 1% Triton X-100; this step was followed by KPBS washes ( 8 changes , 10 mins each ) . Overnight secondary antibody incubation: Biotinylated secondary antibodies or secondary-fluorophore conjugates were diluted in KPBS containing 0 . 1% Triton X-100; this step was followed by KPBS washes ( 6 changes , 10 mins each ) . Overnight tertiary incubation ( if biotinylated secondary antibodies were applied: Streptavdin-fluorophore conjugate was diluted in KPBS; this step was followed by KPBS washes ( 3 changes , 10 mins each ) . Sections were mounted onto glass slides , allowed to dry , and coverslipped , using 50% glycerol in KPBS mountant . Coverslip edges were sealed with clear nail polish . Controls for IHC: For each primary antibody used , a standard control was performed in which the primary antibody was omitted from the protocol ( to control for non-specific signal resulting from subsequent antibody and signal-detection reagents ) . In addition , for GHSR primary antibodies , an adsorption / neutralization was performed using the GHSR peptide sequence ( a propriety sequence derived from a portion of the complete GHSR sequence ) . Following this adsorption , GHSR labeling was abolished . Photomicrographs were acquired using either a Nikon 80i and ( Nikon DS-QI1 , 1280X1024 resolution , 1 . 45 megapixel ) under epifluorescent illumination , or as optical slices using a Zeiss LSM 700 UGRB Confocal System ( controlled by Zeiss Zen software ) . All photomicrographs in the figures are oriented such that: up = dorsal , down = ventral , left = medial , right = lateral . Rats were implanted bilaterally with vHP-targeted cannulae ( n=11 ) . After recovery from surgery , they were put on a meal-entrainment schedule where they were limited to food access for 4 hr daily , beginning at 10:00 AM ( start of dark cycle ) , for 8 days . One day after the last training day , immediately prior to lights off , the meal-entrained rats were injected via their bilaterally implanted cannulae with either 0 µg , 1 µg , or 5 µg of a ghrelin receptor ( GHSR ) antagonist ( JMV2959; total doses: 0 µg , 2 µg , 10 µg ) . Dose selection for JMV2959 was based on previous reports ( Skibicka et al . , 2011; Alvarez-Crespo et al . , 2012 ) . Treatments were separated by 2–3 intervening day using a counterbalanced within-subjects design . Food intake was recorded 4 hr post-injection ( food spillage accounted for ) . To control for the effects of vHP GHSR antagonism on food intake independent of meal-entrainment , 2 additional groups of rats ( n=8/group ) were 20 hr food deprived before receiving vHP injections of vehicle or JMV2959 ( 10 μg ) and having their food intake recorded ( as described above ) . A between-subjects design was used to avoid conditioning effects with repeated food restriction . Given the baseline differences in food intake between meal-entrained and control rats , to control for a lack of observable effects based on low kcal intake ( i . e . , floor effect ) in controls , a separate cohort of non-food restricted rats ( n=11 ) were first habituated to 1 ~3 g pellet of a ‘Western diet’ a day ( 45% kcal fat , enriched with sucrose; Research Diets D12451 ) for 5 days , given at random times to avoid conditioning effects . Two days later , animals received vHP injections of 0 µg , 1 µg , or 5 µg JMV2959 ( total doses: 0 µg , 2 µg , 10 µg ) using a counter-balanced within subjects design ( treatments separated by 2–3 intervening days ) and food intake was recorded as described above . To determine whether endogenous LHA ghrelin signaling also contributes to conditioned feeding responses , we repeated the meal entrainment ( n=9 ) and non-entrained , 20 hr food deprivation ( n=15 ) procedures described above with bilateral , intra-LHA injections of JMV2959 ( total doses: 0 μg , 2 μg , 10 μg ) . Each rat ( n=6 ) received a unilateral injection of CTB and a unilateral contralateral injection of FG targeted to the dorsal perifornical LHA ( dpLHA ) . Seven days later , rats were fixation-perfused , and brains removed and processed as described . Fluorogold was examined using its native fluorescence . Detection of CTB by IHC followed the steps described above , except the following antibodies and fluorophores were used: anti-CTB primary antibody ( mouse monoclonal , 1:500 , Abcam , Cambridge , MA Catalog #ab62429 ) ; biotinylated anti-mouse secondary antibody ( 1:500 , donkey polyclonal , Jackson Immunoresearch , West Grove , PA ) ; streptavidin DyLight 549 tertiary reagent ( 1:500 , Jackson Immunoresearch; overnight ) . For IHC detection of GHSR the following antibodies were used: Anti-GHSR1 primary antibody ( goat , polyclonal; 1:500 , Santa Cruz , Santa Cruz , CA , Catalog #sc-10362 ) ; anti-goat Alexa Fluor 488 secondary antibody ( donkey polyclonal , 1:500 , Jackson Immunoresearch ) . Rats received unilateral NMDA injections targeted to the dpLHA ( n=10 ) or sham lesions ( n=7 ) and cannulae targeting the bilateral vHP . 2 hr into the rats light cycle ( lights on at 8 AM ) , 0 pmol or 300 pmol ghrelin was administered to the vHP ipislateral to the dpLHA lesion . Unilateral ghrelin doses were determined based on pilot studies ( data not shown ) and previous literature ( Kanoski et al . , 2013 ) , where the maximally effective dose for hyperphagia was chosen . In a separate experiment , the same cohort received 0 pmol or 300 pmol ghrelin to the vHP contralateral to the dpLHA lesion . Treatments were separated by intervening 1 day using a counterbalanced mixed design , with sham or lesion as a between-subjects variable , and drug as within-subjects . Chow intake was recorded at 1 , 3 , and 5 hr after injections ( food spillage accounted for ) . Rats ( n = 4 ) received iontophoretic injections of PHAL targeting the vHP . Seven days later , the rats were euthanized and tissue was harvested and processed according to procedures outlined in Materials and methods . IHC detection of PHAL proceeded according to the above described procedures using goat anti-PHAL primary antibody ( 1:5000 , Vector Labs , Catalog #AS-2224 ) , followed by a donkey anti-goat secondary antibody conjugated to Cy3 ( 1:500 , Jackson Immunoresearch , 4 hr ) . Material from the experiment with a PHAL injection site that was most restricted to the vHP field CA1 region of interest was selected for subsequent IHC analysis of vHP connection interactions with dpLHA orexin neurons . IHC detection of orexin was performed as described using a rabbit anti-ORX1 primary antibody ( 1:1000 , Phoenix Pharmaceuticals , Burlingame , CA; Catalog #H-003-30 , 18 hr ) , was followed bya donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to AMCA ( 1:500 , Jackson Immunoresearch , ) . IHC detection of synaptophysin was performed as described using a mouse anti-synaptophysin primary antibody ( 1:1000 , PROGEN Biotechnik , Heidelberg , Germany; Catalog #61012 , 18 hr in room temperature ) , followed by a donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 ( 1:500 , Jackson Immunoresearch ) . Rats received either unilateral vHP ghrelin ( n=5; 300 pmol ) or aCSF vehicle injections ( n=4 ) . 60 min later , animals were euthanized and tissue was harvested and processed according to procedures outlined in Materials and methods . Fos was used as a marker for neuronal activity , and IHC detection was performed according to the procedure above using a sheep anti-Fos primary antibody ( 1:2000 , Cell Signaling , Danvers , MA; Catalog # 2250s , 18 hr ) , followed by a donkey anti-goat secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 ( 1:500 , Jackson Immunoresearch , 4 hr ) . IHC detection of orexin was performed as above using a rabbit anti-Ox1a primary antibody ( 1:1000 , Phoenix Pharmaceuticals , Catalog #H-003-30 , 18 hr ) and was followed up with an incubation of a donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to Cy3 ( 1:500 , Jackson Immunoresearch ) . Quantification of co-localization of Fos and orexin positive cells was calculated by an experimenter blind to the treatment conditions using ImageJ software ( cell count Plugin ) based on the number of co-localized Fos and orexin cells divided by the total number of orexin positive cells . Rats ( n=15 ) received cannulae targeting the both the vHP and LV . 2 hr into light cycle , animals received LV injections of 0 nmol or 30 nmol the orexin-1 receptor antagonist , SB334867 , immediately followed by 0 pmol or 300 pmol ghrelin to the vHP . Dose of SB334867 was determined based on previous literature ( Parise et al . , 2011; Haynes et al . , 2000 ) . Treatments were separated by 1 intervening day using a counterbalanced within-subjects design . Chow intake was measured 1 , 3 , and 5 hr after injections ( food spillage accounted for ) . All statistical analyses employed repeated measures or one-way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) . The α level for significance was 0 . 05 . Statistical analyses were conducted with computer software ( Statistica V7; Statsoft ) . To ensure the minimum sample size required to be reasonably likely to detect the hypothesized effect , power analyses were conducted for each proposed experiment based on our pilot and recently published experiments using Statsoft software ( Statistica 64 , V7 ) . Alpha level was set at 0 . 05 for power analyses; the Root Mean Square Standardized Effect ( RMSSE ) was estimated separately for each experiment"}

During their transition to adapt to life underground , many species have reduced or completely lost their sense of sight , and often have only a small remnant of an eye that can sometimes be completely covered by skin and fur . In addition , the sections of the DNA that usually control how the eyes form have changed in these animals . Since there is less need for a working eye in dark environments , DNA related to the eye is no longer protected from damaging mutations in mammals that live underground . So , by comparing the DNA of mammals that live aboveground and underground , scientists can identify the parts of DNA that help form mammals’ eyes . Previous studies have discovered many sections of DNA responsible for producing the proteins that make up the eye . However , scientists know less about which sections of DNA control when and where these proteins are made . To address this , Partha et al . have studied the DNA of four underground mammals: the star-nosed mole , the cape golden mole , the naked mole-rat and the blind mole-rat . By comparing the DNA of these animals with that of mammals that live above ground , Partha et al . identified sections of DNA that contained an abnormally high number of changes in the blind underground mammals . Many of these sections are involved in forming the eye , including controlling when and where proteins are made . Overall , the findings show that comparing rates of evolution in different species can help uncover sections of DNA that guide and influence how organisms develop . Understanding how the eye is formed is not only of interest to scientists studying evolution and biology; it also has wider applications in healthcare . Many people suffer from unexplained eye abnormalities , and insight into the sections of DNA that control the eye’s development could help medical professionals diagnose these cases and design new treatments .", "article": "1 Introduction The subterranean habitat has been colonized by numerous animal species for its shelter and unique sources of food ( Andersen , 1987; Nevo , 1979 ) . Obligate fossorial species in particular have adopted the underground as a dedicated home , yet the intense demands of life underground often require unique specializations . For one , the air present in tunnels is often low in oxygen ( hypoxic ) and high in carbon dioxide ( hypercapnic ) ( Nevo , 1979 ) . This dark environment also requires the development of enhanced senses to compensate for loss of vision . These and other subterranean specializations have been reported in many independent evolutionary lineages of insects , amphibians , reptiles , and mammals ( Leys et al . , 2003; Lacey et al . , 2000; Albert et al . , 2007; Wilkinson , 2012 ) . Within mammals alone , there are several unrelated subterranean species , including the true moles ( family Talpidae ) , the African golden moles ( Chrysochloridae ) , and the marsupial moles ( Notoryctidae ) . There are also at least three unrelated lineages of subterranean rodents: the naked mole-rat ( Heterocephalus glaber ) , blind mole-rats ( Spalacidae ) , and the pocket gophers ( Geomyidae ) . Fossorial mammals have evolved a number of morphological and physiological traits that are considered adaptations to subterranean life , affecting how they sense their environment , how they move through it , or how they deal with its physiological demands . For one , species that dig with their forelimbs , like the star-nosed mole , have enlarged forelimbs and claws that allow them to tunnel through substrate , whereas species that dig with their teeth , such as the naked mole-rat , have reduced limbs and continuously growing incisors ( Dubost , 1968; Ellerman , 1956 ) . In the absence of light , non-visual sensory systems have been elaborated . These include the sensitive vibrissae ( i . e . , sensory hairs ) of the naked mole-rat and the large and elaborate snout of the star-nosed mole , which has become a remarkable ‘tactile eye’ ( Eloff , 1951; Hill et al . , 2009; Catania , 1999 ) . Fossorial mammals have also evolved an ability to withstand hypoxic conditions that rivals that of species living at high altitude ( Nevo , 1979; Ar et al . , 1977 ) . For example , some species have high erythrocyte counts and high skeletal-muscle myoglobin to facilitate oxygen exchange . Some of these adaptive strategies are shared by different fossorial lineages and as such represent prime examples of convergent evolution ( Nevo , 1979 ) . Yet , some of the most striking convergent transformations in subterranean mammals are the reductions and losses of traits shared among aboveground mammals , of which the most prominent example is the reduction of the eye ( Dubost , 1968; Hill et al . , 2009; Cei , 1946a , 1946b ) . Vision in many subterranean mammals is limited , and the degree of limitation in each species is related to the extent of its underground habitation ( Nemec et al . , 2008; Quilliam , 2009; Sanyal et al . , 1990 ) . For example , star-nosed moles ( Condylura cristata ) that share their time aboveground and underground possess diminutive eyes with thick eyelids ( Catania , 1999 ) , whereas the naked mole-rat , which spends almost all of its time underground , has tiny eyes that are rarely opened ( Hetling et al . , 2005 ) . Even more extreme are the completely subcutaneous eyes of the cape golden mole ( Chrysochloris asiatica ) and the blind mole-rat ( genus Nannospalax ) , which are thought to reflect their strictly subterranean lifestyle ( Sanyal et al . , 1990; Sweet , 1909 ) . While some degree of visual regression is shared between subterranean mammals , not all visual structures and genetic pathways have regressed to the same degree . For instance , the eyes of true moles and mole-rats show anatomical regression and always exhibit a small eye but retain ocular architecture , suggesting that the basic eye developmental programs must be largely intact in these animals ( Carmona et al . , 2008 , 2010; Quilliam , 1966 ) . The convergent loss of vision and visual structures in subterranean mammals allows us to ask which genetic regions – coding or non-coding – contributed to regression in these species and which were conserved . The genetic causes of these malformations have been probed through studies of blind cavefish and evolutionary analysis of retinal genes in subterranean mammals ( Jeffery , 2009; Emerling and Springer , 2014 ) . Pioneering work by Hendriks et al . found the evolutionary rate of the lens and retina protein αA-crystallin to be markedly accelerated in the Middle Eastern blind mole-rat ( Spalax ehrenbergi ) , as would be expected under relaxed constraint ( Hendriks et al . , 1987 ) . Furthermore , Emerling and Springer ( 2014 ) revealed that regressive genetic changes in retinal proteins are unevenly distributed across different visual pathways and eye tissues . Previous studies have placed more emphasis on retinal components of vision and connections to the visual cortex because it is these components that sense light and transmit images to the brain for vision ( Emerling and Springer , 2014; Cooper et al . , 1993 ) . Less emphasis has been placed on the genes contributing to other eye tissues , such as the cornea . The genomes of four subterranean mammals have been sequenced and studied for changes that have occurred in response to their unique environment . The naked mole-rat genome revealed genetic changes in key genes involved in thermogenesis and circadian rhythm , as well as gene loss and deactivating mutations in core visual perception genes ( Kim et al . , 2011 ) . The genome of the blind mole-rat ( Nannospalax gailili ) also yielded diverse insights into its subterranean adaptations , such as an impactful change to the P53 protein that allows cells to escape hypoxia-induced apoptosis , as well as the upregulation of specific pathways involved in the response to hypoxia and hypercapnia ( Fang et al . , 2014 ) . Additionally , parallel evolution was seen in the deactivation of visual perception genes in the blind mole-rat and naked mole-rat . The convergence of such changes provides evidence that they have occurred in response to the subterranean environment rather than as a result of unrelated species-specific conditions or neutral processes , highlighting a potential strategy to discover additional genetic regions showing a similar response ( Losos , 2011; Stern , 2013; Rosenblum et al . , 2014 ) . Previous studies have used convergent evolution to reveal genetic changes that are related to environmental shifts without a priori expectations of which regions might respond . One strategy has been to search for convergent amino acid substitutions at specific protein sites ( Foote et al . , 2015; Liu et al . , 2010; Dobler et al . , 2012 ) . A complementary strategy is to search for convergent changes in selective pressure on larger functional regions , such as genes or regulatory sequences , because evolution at different nucleotides within a gene could nevertheless lead to convergent phenotypic effects . In practice , convergent changes in selective pressure are inferred by studying evolutionary rates , because selective constraint slows evolution , whereas lack of constraint and adaptation speed it . Computational methods employing this strategy search for functional elements whose evolutionary rates changed on those branches exhibiting the convergent environmental change ( Marcovitz et al . , 2016; Hiller et al . , 2012; Chikina et al . , 2016; Lartillot and Poujol , 2011 ) . One demonstration of this approach by our group identified genes that convergently responded when mammalian lineages shifted from a terrestrial to a marine environment ( Chikina et al . , 2016 ) . Another recent study by Prudent et al . ( 2016 ) demonstrated that regions showing convergent rate acceleration in the subterranean environment were enriched in visual perception genes and also contained circadian rhythm genes . Together , these studies show the promise of convergent rates to reveal genes underlying major changes in morphology and physiology that are related to drastic environmental shifts . To investigate the demands placed upon subterranean species by their extreme environment , we searched for genes exhibiting convergent rate changes in four subterranean mammals . We report a large set of genes showing marked relaxation of constraint in subterranean species , which were highly enriched for visual functions . This set also contained many genes of undetermined function , which could be unrecognized causative genes in eye-related diseases . Finally , we pinpointed the eye-specific transcriptional enhancers in the Pax6 gene region using a new variant of our method and demonstrated the potential to detect new eye-specific enhancers at key developmental genes . 2 Results We first sought to identify the genes that responded to conditions in the subterranean environment . Accordingly , we used relative evolutionary rate ( RER ) methods to identify protein-coding genes that evolved at a more rapid rate specifically on subterranean branches of the mammalian phylogenetic tree . Subterranean branches consisted of those leading to the star-nosed mole ( Condylura cristata ) , the cape golden mole ( Chrysochloris asiatica ) , the naked mole-rat ( Heterocephalus glaber ) and the blind mole-rat ( Nannospalax galili ) . Each of these species represents a lineage that independently colonized the subterranean habitat , as each is more closely related to aboveground mammals than they are to each other ( Figure 1A ) . Hence , similar phenotypic changes within these species are regarded as convergent traits . To demonstrate our RER methods , we first present the case of the eye-specific gene LIM2 , which encodes Lens intrinsic membrane protein 2 . First , the amount of amino acid divergence in LIM2 on each mammalian branch was quantified using sequences from 39 species and standard evolutionary models ( Figure 1B ) ( see Materials and methods ) . The resulting LIM2 tree is markedly different from the genome-wide average tree in Figure 1A , and reveals distinctly high amounts of divergence in LIM2 for the four subterranean species . This rapid divergence probably resulted from loss of selective constraint in the dark subterranean environment . To quantify this rate acceleration in the LIM2 tree , we normalized all branch lengths for the expected amount of change as defined by the genome-wide average divergence for each branch . This average , after scaling ( see Materials and methods ) , should reflect both the underlying speciation times in the mammalian phylogeny as well as changes in demographic factors affecting substitution rates . The resulting RER values for each branch are plotted in Figure 1C . An RER of zero indicates that LIM2 evolved at exactly the expected rate on that branch , while positive and negative values reflect faster and slower rates , respectively . By examining RERs it becomes clear that LIM2 changed at abnormally rapid rates in the four subterranean mammals; the rates for all four subterranean species are more rapid than all aboveground species , and this difference is supported statistically ( p=0 . 00084 , Mann-Whitney U test ) . Thus , extending the RER calculations to all other genes , we can distinguish the functions that responded during adaptation to the subterranean environment . Importantly , the convergence of these species allows us to confidently infer genes that responded specifically to subterranean life , because faster rates in all four species are not likely to be due to random fluctuations , as reflected by the low P-value for LIM2 . We performed the same RER analysis on 18 , 980 protein-coding genes to determine which shifted to faster or slower evolutionary rates specifically in subterranean species . We will hereafter refer to such genes as ‘mole-accelerated’ and ‘mole-decelerated’ , respectively ( see Materials and methods ) . At a false discovery rate ( FDR ) of 15% , we identified 55 mole-accelerated genes . We expect mole-accelerated genes to result from either selection for amino acid changes ( i . e . , positive Darwinian selection ) or , alternatively , from a reduction in purifying selection , as suggested for the LIM2 protein . At the other extreme , we identified 1306 mole-decelerated genes at the same FDR . We expect genes to show rate deceleration if there is stronger purifying selection on that gene’s function in the subterranean environment , perhaps as the result of increased importance for fitness . Genes with the strongest evidence of mole-acceleration were consistently associated with function in two organs , eye and skin . To illustrate , 17 of the top 30 mole-accelerated genes are expressed solely in eye tissues or are associated with eye-related disorders , whereas three accelerated genes are associated with skin , hair , and nails ( Table 1 ) . Among the genes showing very strong signals of mole-acceleration , we find proteins tha are specifically expressed in tissues of the eye such as the retina-specific proteins ROM1 and GNAT1 ( Figure 2 ) . The complete list of the 55 mole-accelerated genes similarly contains a large proportion that are related to vision and external tissues ( Supplementary file 1 ) , and they were highly enriched for functional annotations including eye morphology , photoreceptors , visual signal transduction , and eye-related mutant phenotypes ( Table 2 , Supplementary file 2 ) . The strength of this enrichment is clearly illustrated by examining all genes annotated to the Gene Ontology ( GO ) term ‘visual perception’ , because a large fraction of genes that have this annotation are ranked very highly in the list of mole-accelerated genes ( Figure 3A ‘subterranean’ ) . Furthermore , if we were to employ mole-acceleration as a sole predictor of visual function , a search would correctly identify many known visual perception genes with high accuracy , even when searching the entire genome ( Figure 3B ) . This strong enrichment allows us to pose specific hypotheses in subsequent sections about which tissues and genetic pathways were altered during the regressive evolution of the eye . We performed a control analysis to demonstrate that these functional enrichments are unique to subterranean species . We chose four aboveground species ( Control species ) for which there is no reason to expect phenotypic convergence and whose branch lengths are similar to the moles – pika , guinea pig , squirrel and cow . Whereas mole-accelerated genes were enriched in 15 GO categories at a FDR of 15% , control-accelerated genes had no enriched categories at the same FDR ( Supplementary file 2 ) . Furthermore , these control species showed no enrichment of visual perception genes specifically ( Figure 3 ) . There were also 1306 mole-decelerated genes that evolved at significantly slower rates in subterranean species than in other mammals ( Supplementary file 3 ) . Although mole-decelerated genes are individually significant , only one GO category showed significant functional enrichment – GO Biological Process: Nucleic acid binding transcription factor activity – at an FDR of 15% ( Supplementary file 4 ) . A similar control analysis showed 626 genes as being significantly decelerated at an FDR of 15% , and these control-decelerated genes were enriched in 24 GO categories . Therefore , despite there being vastly more mole-decelerated genes than mole-accelerated genes , mole-decelerated genes as a group do not show strong functional enrichment . This result stands in stark contrast to the strong enrichment seen in the mole-accelerated genes . Accelerated rates could have resulted from adaptive evolution or , alternatively , from relaxation of constraint . We distinguished between these scenarios using codon-based evolutionary models to detect signatures of adaptive evolution . We tested whether the nonsynonymous to synonymous rate ratio ( dN/dS ) was significantly greater than 1 – the expectation for positive selection – for any portion of the gene specifically on the subterranean species branches , and also more generally across the entire mammalian phylogeny ( Yang , 2007 ) . Of the top 55 mole-accelerated genes , only one gene rejected a neutral model not allowing dN/dS ratios exceeding 1 in favor of a model allowing positive selection ( dN/dS > 1 ) on subterranean branches ( Supplementary file 5 ) . This gene is involved in connective tissue and hair structure ( KRTAP17-1 ) . The other accelerated genes did not show evidence of adaptive evolution and thus are probably under relaxed constraint . Almost all accelerated genes rejected a model requiring them to have identical constraints in all mammals ( model M1 ) in favor of a model that allowed subterranean-specific relaxation of constraint ( model BS1 ) ( Supplementary file 5 ) . Some of these genes seem to have lost all functional constraint because they show genetic lesions such as stop codons and frameshifts in some subterranean species ( Supplementary file 6 ) . This evidence of relaxed constraint is consistent with the expectation that some vision-related genes have been undergoing regressive evolution . The fossorial lifestyle of subterranean species has selected for traits related to digging and locomotion underground ( Nevo , 1979 ) . Perhaps because of this selective pressure , many of the top mole-accelerated genes encode proteins that are structural components of skin , hair and epithelial connective tissues . The reasons for their acceleration are the result of relaxation of constraint on their coding sequence . Genes encoding keratin proteins 9 , 12 , and 81 ( KRT9 , KRT12 , KRT81 ) were studied using codon models , and the results indicated that they experienced relaxed constraint in subterranean species but not positive selection for amino acid diversification ( Supplementary file 5 ) . They contain early stop codons in multiple subterranean species , which is consistent with complete loss of constraint ( Supplementary file 6 ) . The convergent acceleration and pseudogenization of KRT9 is particularly interesting in relation to burrowing ( Figure 4 ) . In mice , KRT9 expression is confined to footpads , and Krt9−/− null mutants develop footpad calluses due to hyperproliferation of skin ( Fu et al . , 2014 ) . In humans , KRT9 is expressed solely on the palms of hands and the soles of feet , and mutations lead to a skin disorder characterized by hyperkeratosis ( thickening ) of the surfaces of palms and soles – epidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma ( Hennies et al . , 1995 ) . By extension , the loss of KRT9 in subterranean species may also have led to hyperproliferation of footpads , which could carry benefits for tunneling . For example , the star-nosed mole digs with its forepaws , and naked mole-rats collect and remove dirt with their feet ( Jarvis and Sale , 2010; Hamilton , 1931 ) . Such abrasive tasks could place high demands on the footpad surfaces . In addition , mole-acceleration of the POMP gene could similarly have resulted from demands on footpads . A human mutation in POMP is associated with KLICK syndrome , a skin disorder also characterized by hyperproliferation and thickening of palms and footpads ( Dahlqvist et al . , 2010 ) . In addition , we discovered skin- and hair-related genes showing evidence of positive selection rather than of loss of function in subterranean species . Although these genes were not significantly mole-accelerated at a FDR of 15% , they potentially reflect functional changes in response to subterranean adaptation . One such gene , COL4A4 , a gene encoding a subunit of Type IV collagen , was strongly accelerated , did not contain genetic lesions , and showed evidence of positive selection in subterranean species ( Supplementary file 1 , 5 , 6 ) . Type IV collagen is the major structural component of the basal lamina in many tissues , including skin epithelium , and is composed of six subunits , three of which ( COL4A4 , COL4A5 and COL4A3 ) were notably mole-accelerated . On average , the six subunits were more accelerated than 71% of all other genes , which is a significant difference ( p=0 . 0342 , Mann-Whitney U test ) . Whereas Type IV Collagen seems to have responded to the subterranean environment , other major components of the basal lamina , the laminin proteins ( e . g . , LAMA1 ) , were not notably accelerated . In order to compare how specific eye tissues have evolved in subterranean species , we first compiled tissue-specific gene sets using expression data from 91 mouse tissues ( Su et al . , 2004 ) . We identified tissue-specific genes for cornea , iris , lens and retina by selecting those genes with significant differential expression in the tissue of interest but not in other tissues . Using literature , we also compiled a set of 71 important eye developmental genes ( Supplementary file 7 ) . We first asked whether there is a relationship between the degree of tissue-specificity and the degree of mole-acceleration measured as the difference in dN/dS between subterranean and aboveground species ( Figure 5A ) . We found a clear positive correlation between eye tissue-specificity and mole-acceleration , which is consistent with a greater relaxation of constraint on genes with few or no roles outside the eye . Next , we asked which genes with eye-tissue-specific expression showed acceleration and found that genes that are specifically expressed in the cornea ( a protective tissue of the outer eye ) and the iris were not accelerated in subterranean species when compared to a set of randomly chosen genes ( background ) ( Figure 5B and C ) . By contrast , many lens- and retina-specific genes are accelerated . On average , lens genes are more accelerated than 84% of background genes , and retina genes are more accelerated than 82% ( p=9 . 07×10−6 and p=6 . 10×10−10 for lens and retina , respectively , Mann-Whitney U test ) . The contrast between the front and the interior of the eye suggests that the sensory functions of the inner eye , such as phototransduction and the visual cycle , are under relaxed constraint , whereas the protective function of the cornea is not . Indeed , two of these subterranean species have eyes that are open to the environment , such that the cornea may continue to serve as a barrier to pathogens and debris . Eye developmental genes as a whole were not accelerated compared to background , which may reflect the fact that most of them , such as Sonic Hedgehog ( Shh ) , are important in the development of non-eye tissues . However , five eye-specific developmental genes were notably present at the top of the accelerated list ( Vax2 , Nrl , Foxe3 , Crx and Aldh3A1 ) , whereas no eye-specific genes were found lower in the list ( Supplementary file 7 ) . This is consistent with the positive relationship between eye-specificity and relaxation of constraint ( Figure 5A ) . Although we observe specific instances in which eye developmental genes show accelerated rates in subterranean mammals , there is no significant global trend . This is understandable given that a majority of these developmental transcription factors have important roles in the development of non-eye-related tissues . For example , Pax6 is important in the development of pancreas and brain in addition to the eye ( Kleinjan et al . , 2006; Kammandel et al . , 1999; Xu et al . , 1999 ) . Hence the protein-coding sequences of the transcription factors encoded by these genes experience selective pressure against deleterious mutations . However , regulatory regions controlling the expression of these developmental genes in the eye might be under relaxed constraint in subterranean mammals , given the relaxation of the need to maintain the functionality of visual pathways . We hypothesize that these eye-specific cis-regulatory elements ( CREs ) would thus show accelerated rates of evolution in the subterranean mammals . We tested this hypothesis by applying our evolutionary-based method toward identifying eye-specific regulatory elements controlling the expression of the developmental transcription factor PAX6 . We chose the PAX6 system because extensive effort has gone into characterizing the spatiotemporal regulation of its expression ( Kleinjan et al . , 2006; Kammandel et al . , 1999; Xu et al . , 1999; Kleinjan et al . , 2001; Dimanlig et al . , 2001; Griffin et al . , 2002 ) , and there exists comprehensive annotation ofCRE that control the expression of PAX6 in various tissues including the eye . On the basis of existing literature on the transcriptional regulation of Pax6 expression , we identified a 500-kb window containing Pax6 and its neighboring gene Elp4 as our genomic window of interest ( Kleinjan et al . , 2006 ) . Experiments involving transgenic mice revealed various tissue-specific enhancers in a 200-kb region within this genomic window to be important for Pax6 expression . We subsequently identified 150 highly conserved non-coding elements in this genomic window and estimated their evolutionary rates on each mammalian branch . We then calculated the relative rates of the branches using the same projection operator method as was employed for the protein-coding gene trees . We then employed the Mann-Whitney U hypothesis-testing framework to identify non-coding elements that have evolved at an accelerated rate specifically on the subterranean branches ( Materials and methods ) . The results of our analyses show that the three regions showing the strongest signals of convergent acceleration in the subterranean mammals extensively overlap the regions previously annotated to be enhancers important for regulation in eye-specific tissues ( Figure 6A , B ) . ( i ) ‘cre149’ is a 558-basepair ( bp ) region containing the 530-bp region annotated as the ‘alpha , intron 4 retinal’ enhancer ( Kammandel et al . , 1999 ) . ( ii ) ‘cre21’ is a 552-bp region located within the fragment containing HS2 and HS3 of the Distal Regulatory Region , a retina-specific enhancer of PAX6 ( Kleinjan et al . , 2001 ) . ( iii ) ‘cre86’ is a 429-bp region containing the 341-bp long ‘ectodermal enhancer’ , which has been shown to be important in driving the expression of PAX6 in the developing lens ( Dimanlig et al . , 2001 ) . Regions overlapping an enhancer element shown to be regulating PAX6 expression in lens , hindbrain and diencephalon ( the ‘EI’ enhancer element ) do not show significant rate acceleration in the moles ( Kleinjan et al . , 2001 ) . This is in concordance with our expectation that only eye-specific elements show convergent acceleration , and hence the regions overlapping the EI enhancer do not show acceleration given their importance for PAX6 expression in non-eye tissues . Similarly , a 120-bp region overlapping the pancreas enhancer also does not show significant rate acceleration in the moles , as expected ( Kleinjan et al . , 2006; Xu et al . , 1999 ) . In addition to the eye-specific enhancer elements , we observe other regions showing comparable rate acceleration in the moles that are not yet characterized ( Supplementary file 8 ) . These regions are candidate CREs for PAX6 expression in the eye . This preliminary study of the Pax6 transcriptional regulatory module serves to confirm our hypothesis that eye-specific regulatory elements are under relaxed constraint and thus show accelerated rates of evolution in the subterranean mammals . Expanding from our analysis of Pax6 , we performed a large-scale scan for convergently accelerated non-coding elements near transcription factor genes in the mammalian genome . We compiled two sets of transcription factor genes – one comprising 20 genes known to be important in eye development ( the Eye set ) , such as Pax6 , Pax2 , Otx2 , and another set consisting of an equal number of tissue-specific transcription factor genes that are expressed in other tissues and with no evidence of expression in eye ( the Other set ) , which includes Hoxa9 , Pax8 and Sox13 ( Supplementary file 9 ) . We identified 200 conserved non-coding elements near each gene in both sets , totaling to 8000 elements split equally between the two gene sets ( see Materials and methods ) . We subsequently applied our method and calculated the mole-acceleration of each element . This large-scale scan revealed a total of 17 elements as convergently accelerated at an FDR of 10% ( Figure 7A , Supplementary file 10 ) . Fourteen of the 17 elements are found near to genes belonging to the Eye set , reflecting a significant enrichment of mole-accelerated elements near transcription factor genes driving eye development ( Hypergeometric test , p-value=0 . 001 ) . We subsequently checked the genomic locations of these mole-accelerated elements to ensure that they are not clustered at the same locus for instance . These 17 elements are found close to 14 unique genes , with 11 unique genes belonging to the Eye set , and three genes belonging to the Other set , further showcasing the strong enrichment of unique eye developmental transcription factor genes close to mole-accelerated elements ( Hypergeometric test p-value = 0 . 0016 ) . The FANTOM5 consortium has identified putative enhancer sites in the human and mouse genomes based on bidirectional enhancer transcription across tissues as well as at multiple developmental time points ( Andersson et al . , 2014 ) . These putative enhancer sites include genomic regions that are transcribed in the eyeball of mouse embryos at four developmental time points . On the basis of this resource , we compiled two sets of FANTOM5 enhancer sites ( see Materials and methods ) – a set consisting of 900 genomic regions with non-zero expression in the eyeball across four developmental time points ( ‘Eye’ enhancers ) , and another set consisting of 6000 regions with zero expression across the same samples ( ‘Other’ enhancers ) . We subsequently calculated the convergent rate acceleration of these genomic elements in the four subterranean mammals and compared the acceleration observed for the ‘Eye’ enhancers to that of the ‘Other’ enhancers . Our analysis revealed a strong enrichment of FANTOM5 ‘Eye’ enhancers showing convergent rate acceleration in the four subterranean species when compared to the four control species ( Figure 7B ) . We observe 62 FANTOM5 enhancers in total that showed significant mole acceleration at an FDR of 15% ( Supplementary file 11 ) . Fifteen of these correspond to the FANTOM5 Eye enhancers set , reflecting a significant enrichment of detected FANTOM5 eye enhancers using mole-acceleration ( Hypergeometric test p-value=0 . 006 ) . To understand differences in the visual capabilities of mammals systematically , we studied the overall relative rates of evolution of visual genes across all mammals . Our gene set of interest ( 189 genes in total ) was comprised of all genes with ‘Visual perception’ GO term annotation , excluding developmental transcription factors . For each species , we then calculated the mean relative rate across all of the genes ( Figure 8 ) . We observed the four subterranean mammals to be among the accelerated species ( with mean >0 ) , as was our expectation . However , we also observed aboveground species with overall rate accelerations comparable to those of the moles , such as the armadillo , the thirteen-lined ground squirrel , the big brown bat , David’s myotis bat and a shrew . Notably , all of these mammals show varying types of visual regression: the armadillo has poor vision characterized by a lack of cone cells in the retina ( McDonough and Loughry , 2013 ) , and shrews also have poor vision and diminutive eyes , which in some species are hidden in fur ( Nowak , 1999 ) . The nocturnal big brown bat and David’s myotis bat possess reduced eyes and rely on echolocation for navigation ( Koay et al . , 1998 ) . The thirteen-lined ground squirrel displays a rare visual trait: the central region of its retina is dominated by cone photoreceptors in contrast to the retinas of most mammals ( Kim et al . , 2016 ) . These scenarios could have important implications because the ground squirrel is used as a model for vision research ( Li et al . , 2010; Chen and Li , 2012 ) . 3 Discussion The independent transitions of four mammals to a subterranean environment has been accompanied by convergent phenotypic changes that have arisen as a result of adaptation to new environmental stresses in the underground ecotope ( Nevo , 1979; Leys et al . , 2003; Lacey et al . , 2000; Albert et al . , 2007; Wilkinson , 2012 ) . Here , we report a genome-wide effort encompassing both coding and regulatory regions to identify the changes in genotype that have accompanied this phenotypic adaptation by studying changes in their evolutionary rates . Our study reveals that genes showing convergent acceleration in subterranean species are highly enriched for function in visual pathways . The decreased selective pressure on visual pathways in the dim-light subterranean environment leads to a relaxation of constraint on genetic elements involved in various eye-related phenotypes , including eye morphology , photoreception and visual transduction . In addition to accelerated change in genes in visual pathways , we observe an accelerated rate of evolution of many genes involved in skin-related phenotypes in the subterranean mammals . Whereas we see accelerated change in visual genes primarily as a result of relaxation of constraint , we see that some skin-related genes also show accelerated change due to positive selection , perhaps as a result of selection of traits contributing to a fossorial lifestyle . Aside from these two phenotypes , we do not observe a comparably strong enrichment for genes involved in the other environmental challenges associated with a subterranean lifestyle , such as hypoxia , hypercapnia and high infectivity . It is possible that the subterranean mammals may show species-specific adaptations to these stresses , whereas our analysis from a convergent evolutionary perspective reflects changes common to all the species . Closer examination of the accelerated genes that are enriched for vision-related pathways reveals that accelerated genes tend to be lens- or retina-specific . On the other hand , genes encoding specifically for the outer ocular structure , the cornea , do not show significant acceleration , indicating the preservation of developmental programs that are important for ocular architecture . In two of the four moles with non-subcutaneous eyes , the cornea can come into direct contact with the external environment , perhaps necessitating the proper development of the structure in the highly infective subterranean niche . Lens- and retina-specific genes that are involved with the processes of photoreception and phototransduction would be under greater relaxed constraint given the dim-light environment , accruing damaging mutations at a much higher rate . Our analyses also reveal that genes that are associated with congenital eye diseases are accelerated in the four subterranean mammals . For the lens , which is largely made up of crystallins , we find many crystallin genes ( Crybb3 , Cryba1 , Crybb1 , Crygc , Crygs , etc . ) in our accelerated set of genes contributing to various forms of cataracts ( Graw , 2009 ) . Similarly , we find multiple genes involved in ciliopathies to be accelerated , including ‘deleted in primary ciliary dyskinesia’ ( Dpcd ) , Iqcb1 ( a component of primary cilia ) , and ciliary neurotrophic factor ( Cntf ) . Further inspection of the accelerated list of genes could potentially reveal new candidate genes that are important for congenital eye diseases . Genes that are involved in the embryonic development of eyes do not show significant global acceleration , potentially due to their pleiotropic nature: these developmental transcription factors tend to have important regulatory roles in non-eye-related pathways that are not under relaxed constraint . We successfully tested our hypothesis that eye-specific regulatory elements of such genes are under relaxed constraint in the moles , using a novel variant of our approach that calculates convergent rate acceleration at the non-coding level . Although the strong rate acceleration in the three eye-specific enhancers of PAX6 suggests relaxation of constraint in the subterranean mammals , in the absence of functional tests we cannot be sure that the eye-specific activity is truly lost . Furthermore , we found an enrichment of such convergently accelerated non-coding regions preferentially near eye developmental transcription factor genes , identifying potential enhancer elements driving the expression of these genes specifically in the eye . As a large-scale validation approach , we show that rate acceleration in subterranean mammals strongly overlaps regions identified as eye enhancers by the FANTOM5 consortium . These proof-of-principle analyses serve to illustrate the power of convergent-evolution-based tools for the identification of eye-specific regulatory elements . Despite the apparent rapid rate of enhancer evolution across mammals , our methods and those of colleagues showcase the utility of applying evolution-based approaches to conserved non-coding regions in identifying regulatory elements underlying important developmental functions ( Marcovitz et al . , 2016; Villar et al . , 2015 ) . These methods present a unique opportunity to perform genome-wide scans for eye- and other tissue-specific regulatory elements , and potentially serve as complementary approaches to genome-wide assays in the identification of active enhancer elements in the genome . As more genomes are sequenced , we expect these methods to become more powerful in revealing gene regulatory changes underlying convergent phenotypes . Overall , our results suggest that genes and non-coding regions that are involved in vision pathways are accumulating deleterious mutations by neutral processes , given the relaxation of constraint on these pathways in the subterranean environment . However , this does not preclude the possibility that the initial inactivating mutations in these pathways were adaptive in nature . The initial shutdown of eye development may have been caused by positively selected changes , followed by continued regression of structural and physiological eye genes through neutral processes . Indeed , there is evidence of such a progression of events during eye regression in blind cavefish ( Jeffery , 2005 ) . Adaptive forces for reduced eyes may have been driven by the energetic costs of maintaining functioning eyes and the risk of pathogen entry through the eye ( Moran et al . , 2015 ) . We note that our rate-based analysis detects signatures of sequence divergence that are based on what is observed at the end of these processes and does not shed light on the nature of the initial inactivating changes . In addition , our methods detect convergent changes in the rates of evolution of genes and hence are not designed to detect species-specific changes that might contribute to the subterranean adaptation . Our results showcasing acceleration in the rates of convergent evolution of visual genes strongly supports previous reports of visual regression in the subterranean habitat . Emerling and Springer ( 2014 ) studied the regression of retinal genes in three of these four subterranean species and showed that a decrease in the amount of light entering the retina is associated with higher incidence of inactivating mutations in retinal genes . They found a significantly higher number of retinal pseudogenes in the moles compared to that in closely related subaerial species , an observation concordant with our results based on rate acceleration . Genome sequencing efforts for naked mole-rat and blind mole-rat also showed a strong enrichment of pseudogenes in visual pathways that are associated with the degradation of vision in these species ( Cooper et al . , 1993; Kim et al . , 2011 ) . A genome-wide study by Prudent et al . ( 2016 ) detected significant genomic differences in genes involved in vision-related pathways such as eye development and perception of light in two of these four subterranean mammals , namely cape golden mole and blind mole-rat . Using our rates-based framework , we performed a rigorous investigation of convergently evolving genes in a large set of four subterranean species , and elucidated the tissue-specificity and underlying reasons for their convergent rate changes . In a first-of-its-kind demonstration at the non-coding level , we applied our methods successfully to detect eye-specific enhancers showing accelerated evolution in subterranean mammals . Visual regression is not limited to these four mole species , and mammals display specific types of regression and other general differences in visual capabilities . Our analysis of visual gene rates across other species revealed interesting patterns and trends , wherein some aboveground species with poor or remodeled visual systems showed mean rate acceleration comparable to subterranean mammals ( Figure 8 ) . This provides an opportunity to further probe specific differences in the development and function of visual systems in terms of the specific pathways that are relaxed or under constraint across species . In addition , integrating these other species into our rate-based framework can help in fine-tuning the predictive power of the evolutionary-based approaches . Deliberate selection of foreground branches based on specific combinations among these vision-impaired mammals might greatly improve the power of the methods in detecting convergent changes , especially at the non-coding level . In this regard , the availability of rich and diverse phenotypic annotations across mammals further lays the ground for the development of evolutionary-based approaches in functional and phenotypic annotation of non-coding regions ( Marcovitz et al . , 2016; O’Leary et al . , 2011; O'Leary et al . , 2013 ) . 4 Materials and methods Given the absence of Nannospalax galili ( blind mole-rat or BMR ) in the 100-species alignments made available by the UCSC genome browser , we employed a custom approach to add the correct BMR orthologous sequence based on its closest relative on the mammalian species phylogeny , mouse . Using the publicly available BMR gene models ( ftp://ftp . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov/genomes/all/GCF_000622305 . 1_S . galili_v1 . 0/ ) , we first perform ed pairwise reciprocal nucleotide blast of all BMR gene cDNA sequences and the corresponding cDNA sequences of all genes in the mouse mm9 genome . For every mm9 gene sequence , we subsequently identify the correct BMR ortholog using the InParanoid program as follows: the program clusters pairs of sequences from the two queried genomes into groups of orthologs , and the BMR sequence forming the main ortholog pair ( pairs with mutually best hit ) in every group was identified as the correct ortholog ( Remm et al . , 2001 ) . We then performed a profile alignment using the openly available Muscle program to add the identified BMR ortholog to the gene’s multi-species alignment ( Edgar , 2004 ) . For all analyses involving non-coding regions , we utilized a simpler approach to identify the BMR orthologous region . For each non-coding region of interest , we performed blastn with the mm9 orthologous sequence as the query against the BMR assembled genome , with the default Expect ( E ) value of 10 ( NCBI Resource Coordinators , 2016 ) . The resulting best scoring blastn hit in the BMR genome , if any , was added to the non-coding region’s multi-species alignment ( obtained from the UCSC genome browser ) using the profile alignment utility of the Muscle program ( Edgar , 2004 ) . Using the 100-way 100 vertebrate species amino acid alignments from the multiz alignment available at the UCSC genome browser ( Blanchette et al . , 2004; Harris , 2007 ) , those alignments with a minimum of 10 species that are also present in at least two subterranean species were selected for the study . We pruned each alignment to include only the 39 species of interest represented in the proteome-wide average tree ( Figure 1A ) , after adding the BMR ortholog of the corresponding gene sequence to this alignment as described in the previous section . For each resulting amino acid alignment , we estimated branch lengths using the ‘aaml’ program from the phylogenetic analysis using the maximum likelihood ( PAML ) package ( Yang , 2007 ) . Branch lengths were estimated under an empirical model of amino acid substitution rates with rate variability between sites modeled as a gamma distribution approximated with four discrete classes ( for computational efficiency ) and an additional class for invariable sites ( aaml model ‘Empirical + F’ ) ( Whelan and Goldman , 2001; Yang , 1996 ) . Branch lengths were estimated on a published mammalian species tree topology ( Murphy et al . , 2004 ) , modified to include Nannospalax galili whose position in the tree was inferred based on existing literature on its ancestry ( Fang et al . , 2014 ) . For the analyses involving conserved non-coding elements , we identified the elements of interest based on the human phastCons track generated from the 100-way vertebrate multiz alignment , eliminating any region of overlap with the human mRNAs track . For each such element , we obtained an alignment of orthologous regions across our species of interest , pruning from the UCSC 100-way multiz alignment . The previous section further details the procedure employed for adding the BMR orthologous region . We subsequently estimated the branch lengths using the baseml program of the PAML package under the general reversible process ( REV ) model for nucleotide substitution rates , with rate variability between sites modeled as a gamma distribution approximated with four discrete classes and an additional class for invariable sites ( Blanchette et al . , 2004; Rodríguez et al . , 1990 ) . Subsequent to reconstructing the maximum likelihood trees using PAML , we filter out the trees of genetic elements that have zero branch lengths in at least 80% of the species present in the tree . Raw branch lengths in trees retained after this filtering step were transformed into relative rates using a projection operator method ( Sato et al . , 2005 ) . These branch-specific relative rates were then used to perform a Mann-Whitney U test and correlation analysis over the binary variable of ‘subterranean’ or ‘aboveground’ ( i . e . , not subterranean ) branches ( Figure 1A ) . Subterranean branches are those leading to the star-nosed mole ( Condylura cristata ) , cape golden mole ( Chrysochloris asiatica ) , naked mole-rat ( Heterocephalus glaber ) and blind mole-rat ( Nannospalax galili ) . We performed functional enrichment analysis using the GOrilla tool by searching for enriched GO terms in the foreground set of genes compared to the full background set of genes tested for mole convergence ( Eden et al . , 2009 ) . In addition to this , functional information for subterranean-associated genes was mined from the Uniprot and RefSeq databases , and from literature cited directly ( UniProt Consortium , 2007; Pruitt et al . , 2007 ) . Enrichment analysis was performed using the hypergeometric test with the background set of genes restricted to genes that were tested for mole convergence and that had at least one annotation in the corresponding annotation file . Correction for multiple testing was performed using false discovery rate q-values ( Storey , 2002 ) . False Discovery Rate analysis was performed on probabilities resulting from the Mann-Whitney U test . We employed an empirical permutation-based FDR calculation , often the standard approach in genome-wide analysis . We generated 10 , 000 null datasets , obtaining each dataset by randomly permuting the species labels of the relative rates . This process is equivalent to calculating the Mann-Whitney U test and correlation analysis over four random branches vs the rest instead of over the binary variable of ‘subterranean’ vs ‘aboveground’ branches . The subsequent permuted datasets were used to estimate the FDR q-values for each p-value in our subterranean correlation analysis . Genes showing a correlation greater than or equal to 0 . 5 in the Mann-Whitney U test and significant at a FDR of 15% were considered mole-accelerated genes , and the p-value reflecting the strength of this acceleration is referred to as mole-acceleration . Similarly , genes showing a correlation less than 0 . 5 and significant at a FDR of 15% are considered mole-decelerated genes . In order to determine how specific eye tissues have evolved across subterranean species , we first identified tissue-specific gene sets using microarray expression data from 91 mouse tissues ( Su et al . , 2004 ) . We isolated tissue-specific genes for cornea , iris , lens and retina ( including retinal pigmented epithelium ) . These sets were defined as those with significant differential expression only in the tissue of interest compared to all other tissues at an alpha of 0 . 05 ( T-test ) . The subterranean-accelerated genes were subjected to phylogenetic models of codon evolution to test for significant evidence of relaxation of constraint or positive selection over the subterranean mammal branches . Using PAML , we ran codeml using five different models: the branch-site neutral model ( BS Neutral ) , the branch-site selection model ( BS Alt Mod ) , the sites neutral model ( M1 ) , the positive selection model ( M8 ) and its null model ( M8A ) ( Yang , 2007 ) . To assess the significance of relaxation of constraint on subterranean mammal branches , we performed likelihood ratio tests ( LRT ) between BS Neutral and its nested null model M1 . LRTs between BS Alt Mod and its null BS Neutral were used to infer positive selection on subterranean mammal branches . Probabilities were assigned for each of these two LRTs using the chi-square distribution with 1 degree of freedom . Mammal-wide positive selection was inferred using the M8 vs M8A models and their respective LRT , using 1 degree of freedom chi square distribution to assess LRT significance . For calculating the correlation between mole-acceleration and degree of tissue-specificity of genes , we estimated the mole-acceleration of each gene as follows: using a branch-site selection model ( BS Alt Mod ) we estimated two different values of ω ( dN/dS ) – one for the four subterranean branches and one for the rest of the branches on the tree . Mole-acceleration was calculated as the difference in the two ω values that were estimated ."}

Conformational flexibility in regions of intrinsic disorder within A-kinase anchoring protein 79 ( AKAP79 ) delineates PP2B access to phosphoproteins .

Live-cell imaging with fluorescent activity-sensors infers that this region fine-tunes calcium responsiveness and drug sensitivity of the anchored phosphatase .", "plain language summary": "Signaling molecules such as the hormone epinephrine ( also known as adrenaline ) activate a range of responses inside cells . The responses often involve proteins being chemically modified to change how active they are , which in turn controls specific processes happening inside the cell . One type of modification involves certain enzymes adding or removing molecules known as phosphate groups from specific proteins . For example , an enzyme called PP2B ( also known as calcineurin ) is able to remove phosphate groups from a variety of proteins . PP2B plays crucial roles in many different processes in animals including immune responses , nerve cell signaling and heart activity , and is the target of several medicinal drugs that suppress the immune system . Since PP2B plays so many roles in the body , these drugs often have unintended side effects . Therefore , studying how the body regulates this enzyme may help us to understand what causes these side effects . Previous studies have shown that PP2B is activated by calcium ions , which can act as signals in many different situations inside cells . A protein called AKAP79 anchors PP2B to specific locations in the cell so that it only operates where it is needed . Some evidence suggests that calcium ions affect how AKAP79 and PP2B interact , but it is not known how this works . Nygren et al . investigated how the PP2B enzyme and AKAP79 protein interact inside human cells and in cell-free systems . The experiments showed that short regions within the AKAP79 protein are responsible for binding to PP2B . These regions and the flexible structure of the entire AKAP79 protein work together to fine-tune how PP2B responds to calcium ions . In the presence of higher levels of calcium ions , another ‘auxiliary’ region of AKAP79 also binds to PP2B . This auxiliary region binds to a site on the enzyme where an immunosuppressive drug called cyclosporine can also bind . This suggests that AKAP79 binding to PP2B may affect the sensitivity of the PP2B enzyme to cyclosporine . This study demonstrates that the activity of PP2B can be precisely controlled by interactions with proteins such as AKAP79 . Further work on these interactions may help develop more effective drugs that cause fewer side effects in patients .", "article": "1 Introduction Processing information through cell signaling complexes utilizes all four levels of protein structure . Protein-interaction modules delineate the architecture of these macromolecular assemblies by aligning signaling elements in relation to scaffolding components . These structurally distinct protein folds often recognize primary structure determinants embedded within reciprocal binding surfaces ( Scott and Pawson , 2009 ) . Advances in electron microscopy ( EM ) emphasize that protein flexibility is another feature that influences how multivalent enzyme complexes adapt to the continually changing intracellular environment ( Saibil , 2000 ) . For example , intrinsic disorder within regulatory domains of constrained protein kinases guides the phosphorylation of nearby substrates ( Smith et al . , 2013 ) , whereas association of phosphatases with targeting subunits can bias catalytic efficiency toward certain phosphoproteins ( Hendrickx et al . , 2009; Nygren and Scott , 2015 ) . Hence , conformational order and disorder act in concert to fine-tune intracellular signaling scaffolds . Although protein kinases recognize consensus sequence motifs flanking phospho-acceptors ( Yaffe et al . , 2001 ) , compartmentalization via association with anchoring and scaffolding proteins is an equally important determinant of substrate specificity ( Scott et al . , 2013 ) . In parallel , phosphatase-targeting subunits orchestrate where and when dephosphorylation events occur in the cell ( Ceulemans and Bollen , 2004 ) . Additionally , anchored kinases and phosphatases often reside within the same macromolecular complex ( Langeberg and Scott , 2015 ) . Such pre-formed bi-directional signaling units modulate key physiological processes including immune responses , glucose homeostasis , renal water balance and excitatory synaptic transmission ( Clipstone and Crabtree , 1992; Hinke et al . , 2012; Nygren and Scott , 2016; Sanderson et al . , 2012; Whiting et al . , 2016 ) . A unifying molecular principle shared by these wide-ranging physiological responses is that signal termination through targeted phosphatases is the predominant regulatory step . Dephosphorylation resets the system to prime anchored enzyme assemblies for the next pulse or wave of signal . This concept is vividly illustrated in the heart where kinase-phosphatase signaling complexes repetitively respond to synchronized pulses of Ca2+ and cAMP during excitation-contraction coupling ( Bers , 2008; Lygren and Taskén , 2006 ) . We investigate how intrinsic disorder influences the maintenance and mechanics of complexes between the calcium/calmodulin dependent protein phosphatase-2B ( PP2B , also called calcineurin or PPP3 ) and the prototypic anchoring protein AKAP79 . Stable interaction with PP2B proceeds through a PxIxIT-like motif that was originally identified in the NFAT transcription factors and the regulator of calcineurin ( RCAN ) , whereas transient contact engages other binding surfaces including LxVP-related sequences ( Dell'Acqua et al . , 2002; Park et al . , 2000; Rodríguez et al . , 2009; Roy and Cyert , 2009; Roy et al . , 2007 ) . We show that intrinsic disorder within dormant AKAP79-PP2B assemblies permits a range of extended configurations that are condensed into globular signaling complexes following activation with calcium . Cellular validation for this model is provided by live-cell imaging with fluorescent reporters of anchored PP2B activity . 2 Results Bioinformatic analyses indicate that AKAP79 consists of defined protein interaction modules linked by regions of intrinsic disorder . Analysis with IUPred ( Dosztányi et al . , 2005 ) and PONDR ( Li et al . , 1999 ) predict extended regions of disorder within the first 350 amino acids of AKAP79 , whereas the C-terminal portion of the anchoring protein is more ordered ( Figure 1A and B ) . This is consistent with evidence showing that the C-terminal region encompasses the PKA-binding helix ( blue; Carr et al . , 1991; Gold et al . , 2006 ) . The ANCHOR and SLiMPred programs identify regions that are predicted to adopt static conformations upon association with protein binding partners ( Dosztányi et al . , 2009; Mooney et al . , 2012 ) . These include known binding sites within AKAP79 for protein kinase C/calmodulin ( green ) and PP2B ( red ) ( Coghlan et al . , 1995; Dell'Acqua et al . , 2002; Faux and Scott , 1997; Klauck et al . , 1996; Oliveria et al . , 2007 ) . Short linear motifs of unknown function were also evident , including a prominent peak at residues 122–136 of the anchoring protein ( Figure 1C and D , orange ) . These predictive approaches were a prelude to structural analyses of selected AKAP79 sub-complexes . His-tagged MBP-AKAP79 , GST-PP2B holoenzyme and GST-calmodulin ( CaM ) were expressed in bacteria and purified by affinity chromatography on the appropriate resins ( Figure 1E ) . GST tags were removed by proteolytic cleavage . A macromolecular complex was assembled upon incubation of AKAP79 with molar excesses of PP2B holoenzyme and CaM overnight at 4˚C . Separation by size-exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 column provided a reconstituted AKAP79 complex containing all protein components as assessed by SDS-PAGE analysis ( Figure 1F and G , lanes 4–7 ) . Limited degradation of certain protein components occurred during assembly of the macromolecular complex . MS/MS sequencing has previously detected PP2B degradation products of 30 and 45 kDa and there is also an untagged AKAP79 form at ~75 kDa ( Gold et al . , 2011 ) . The apparent molecular mass of this protein complex was 450–550 kDa ( Figure 1F ) . However , quantitative analysis with in-line multi-angle light scattering ( SEC-MALS ) revealed a monodispersed complex of 160 kDa ( Figure 1J ) . This corresponds to a 1:1:1:1 ratio of protein components within the AKAP79-PP2B-CaM sub-complex . Further characterization by SDS-PAGE confirmed the presence of each protein component ( Figure 1H ) , while analysis by native PAGE detected a macromolecular complex in excess of 480 kDa ( Figure 1I ) . Since intrinsically disordered proteins often elute from size-exclusion columns early , we suggest that AKAP79 complexes are disordered . Dormant PP2B is auto-inhibited by a helical segment of its A subunit . Binding of Ca2+/CaM relieves inhibition to expose the active site of the phosphatase ( [Li et al . , 2011] , Figure 2A ) . An important question is whether tethering to AKAP79 alters the activation of PP2B . Therefore , AKAP79/PP2B holoenzyme complexes formed either in the presence of the calcium chelator EDTA or with excess Ca2+/CaM were separated by size-exclusion chromatography ( Figure 2B and C ) . Both complexes eluted from the HiLoad Superdex 200 s column with slightly differing retention times . However , although we sometimes observed the active complex ( containing CaM ) eluting slightly earlier than the dormant complex , the retention time discrepancies were not replicable , due to the fact that these purification steps were carried out to be preparatory rather than analytical . The protein composition of peak fractions ( shaded areas ) was analyzed by SDS-PAGE ( Figure 2D ) . A modified GraFix glutaraldehyde fixation protocol was used to preserve the integrity of each purified complex for subsequent structural analyses ( Kastner et al . , 2008 ) . Migration as a single high-molecular weight band on SDS-PAGE confirmed the stabilization of macromolecular assemblies . These high molecular weight complexes did not have degradation products ( Figure 2D ) . Immunoblot analyses confirmed the presence of each protein component in the cross-linked macromolecular assemblies ( Figure 2E–G ) . We observed that the anti-PP2B B subunit antibody had some cross reactivity with CaM , which led to a slightly stronger western blot signal in the active complex than in the dormant complex . Samples were applied to EM grids and uranyl formate-stained prior to image acquisition and random conical-tilt analyses ( Figure 2H and I ) . Particles of 150–200 Å in diameter were auto picked from micrographs using the DoG ( Difference of Gaussians ) Picker program ( Voss et al . , 2009 ) . Random conical-tilt ( RCT ) images were acquired at 55˚ angles and paired to cognate un-tilted particles using TiltPicker ( Figure 2H and I , [Voss et al . , 2009] ) . Reference-free class averaging of dormant AKAP79/PP2B sub-complexes yielded a refined data set of 10 , 652 elements . The reference-based alignment program SPIDER generated 25 representative classes , each containing ~500–1100 particles ( Figure 3A ) . Conformational diversity within these structural classes was immediately evident . To validate this observation we measured the principle axis ( length ) of each class and weighted this value by the number of particles in the class ( Figure 3B ) . Particles segregated into two populations with mean lengths of 184 ± 16 Å ( n = 7499 ) and 228 ± 5 Å ( n = 3153 , Figure 3B , blue ) . Three-dimensional rendering of selected RCT classes exhibited a range of configurations ( Figure 3C–E ) . These models , although of similar width and depth ( Figure 3C–E , bottom ) vary in length from 160 to 240 Å ( Figure 3C–E , top ) . Thus , dormant AKAP79-PP2B holoenzyme complexes exist in a variety of flexible and extended topologies . In contrast , active AKAP79/PP2B/CaM complexes are more uniform . Reference-based alignment of a refined data set of 20 , 461 elements yielded 25 representative classes that segregated into a single population of active particles with a mean length of 178 ± 17 Å ( Figure 3F and G , orange ) . Three-dimensional rendering of representative AKAP79/PP2B/CaM classes reveals more compact and globular complexes ( Figure 3H–J ) . Yet both the dormant and the active macromolecular units occupy similar volumes ( 7 . 4 × 105 Å3 ) , when isosurface thresholds are set to match 2-D averages . This implies that additional intermolecular contacts residing within the active AKAP79/PP2B/CaM complex sustain a more globular topology . Multimodal subunit mapping was used to position individual protein components within a 3D model of the active AKAP79/PP2B/CaM assembly . First , Fab fragments of IgG against the MBP tag localized the N-terminus of AKAP79 in a density at the top of a predominant class average ( Figure 4A–G ) . Second , a 1 . 8 nm nanogold-NiNTA conjugate labeled the His-tag on the C-terminus of the anchoring protein ( Figure 4H–M ) . Gold particles decorated the core of the active AKAP79/PP2B/CaM complex ( Figure 4J and M ) . Third , Fab fragments against Flag-tagged A subunit of PP2B localized the catalytic subunit of the phosphatase in the lower lobe of the macromolecular assembly ( Figure 4N–R ) . This data was compared with unlabeled RCT models and consolidated into a composite color-coded model depicting the topology of an active AKAP79/PP2B/CaM complex processively rotated by 90˚ ( Figure 4S–V and Figure 4—video 1 ) . The predicted location of CaM ( blue ) is also indicated . A combined chemical cross-linking and mass spectrometry approach was employed to further define the intermolecular contacts between AKAP79 and the PP2B holoenzyme . Purified dormant and active assemblies were subjected to chemical cross-linking using 10 mM biotin-aspartate proline-PIR n-hydroxyphthalimide ( BDP-NHP ) at room temperature for 1 hr . After denaturation and trypsin digestion , cross-linked peptides were analyzed by liquid chromatography Mass Spec ( LC-MS3 ) . Real time Analysis for Cross-linked peptide Technology ( ReACT ) , an algorithm to identify and assign sequences to cross-linked peptide pairs , charted protein-protein interaction surfaces within these macromolecular assemblies ( Weisbrod et al . , 2013 ) . Distinct interaction maps were derived for the dormant and active AKAP79/PP2B complexes ( Figure 5A and B; Supplementary file 1 ) . In the dormant complex , a consensus PP2B interaction motif located between residues 337–343 of AKAP79 ( PIAIIIT ) was the only site of contact with the phosphatase ( Figure 5A red and Supplementary file 1 ) . In contrast , a total of four additional AKAP79-PP2B A subunit interfaces were evident in the active complex ( Figure 5B , red ) . These ancillary AKAP-interactive peptides reside within the lower lobe of the catalytic subunit of PP2B ( Figure 5C and D , green , blue , teal and lime ) and are proximal to a previously defined binding surface for the PIAIIIT motif ( Li et al . , 2012 ) . This consolidates the finding that the active AKAP79-PP2B-CaM complex is more compact ( Figure 3 ) . ReACT also identified a cross-link between lysine 126 on AKAP79 and lysine 165 on the B subunit of PP2B ( Figure 5B , orange ) . This peptide pair was exclusively detected in the active complex . We can therefore infer that amino terminal regions of the anchoring protein contact the B subunit of the active phosphatase holoenzyme ( Figure 5C and D , orange peptide ) . A recognizable feature of the AKAP79 peptide is the sequence Leu-Lys-Ile-Pro , which resembles a consensus LxVP phosphatase interaction module ( Rodríguez et al . , 2009; Sheftic et al . , 2016 ) . Interestingly , this sequence is located within a disordered region of the anchoring protein predicted to form a short linear interaction motif ( Figure 1D and E , orange bar ) . Moreover , comparison with a structure of PP2B in complex with the immunosuppressive agent cyclosporin/cyclophilin suggests that this segment of AKAP79 may target the same binding surface as the drug complex ( Figure 5E–F , [Jin and Harrison , 2002] ) . Molecular modeling predicts that the core Leu-Lys-Ile-Pro ( LKIP ) motif on AKAP79 slots into this drug-binding pocket on PP2B ( Figure 5G ) . Yet , one distinction is that residues downstream of this motif contact PP2B ( Figure 5G ) . This is in contrast to conventional PP2B interacting partners that utilize determinants upstream of the LxVP motif to enhance the binding affinity for targeting subunits ( Sheftic et al . , 2016 ) . In vitro biochemical approaches were used to further characterize the new PP2B binding surface on AKAP79 . Solid-phase spot-arrays of 20-mer peptides spanning the entire anchoring protein ( each displaced by three residues ) were screened for interaction with PP2B ( Figure 6A and B ) . Analyses were carried out in the presence of Ca2+/CaM or EDTA to determine which interactive surfaces were calcium dependent . Residues 122 to 136 of AKAP79 formed a Ca2+ responsive PP2B-binding region ( Figure 6B ) . Notably , determinants flanking the core Leu-Lys-Ile-Pro quadrapeptide ( residues 125–128; LKIP ) contributed to Ca2+-dependent phosphatase anchoring , since pretreatment with EDTA abolished all protein-protein interactions ( Figure 6B ) . Control arrays confirmed tonic PP2B interaction through the well-defined PIAIIIT motif ( Figure 6C , [Dell'Acqua et al . , 2002; Li et al . , 2012; Oliveria et al . , 2007] ) . Taken together these studies define a region of AKAP79 between residues 122 and 136 that interfaces with the B subunit of the active PP2B holoenzyme . Next , GST pull-downs with purified PP2B established whether the LKIP motif is a principle binding-determinant for active PP2B . Purified fragments encompassing residues 1–153 , 154–296 , and 297–427 of AKAP79 were screened for interaction with the phosphatase ( Figure 6D ) . Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that the N-terminal fragment bound to the phosphatase only in the presence of Ca2+/CaM ( Figure 6D , top panel , lane 2 ) . Protein-protein interaction was abolished in the presence of an LxVP competitor peptide derived from the transcription factor NFAT ( Figure 6D , top panel , lane 4; [Park et al . , 2000] ) . Binding was also lost upon chelation of calcium ( Figure 6D , top panel , lane 3 ) . Likewise , PP2B binding was abolished when experiments were repeated with a mutant N-terminal fragment of AKAP79 that lacked the LKIP motif ( Figure 6D , top panel lanes 5–8 ) . Control experiments confirmed tonic PP2B binding though the PIAIIIT motif located in the C-terminal fragment of the anchoring protein ( Figure 6D , top panel lanes 13–16 ) . The middle fragment does not interact with the phosphatase under any conditions ( Figure 6D , top panel lanes 9–12 ) . Ponceau staining served as a loading control ( Figure 6D , bottom panel ) . In parallel , phosphatase activity measurements using the small molecule substrate ( diFMUP ) demonstrated that AKAP79 associated-PP2B retained full activity ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1 ) . AlphaScreen assays were used to measure the binding affinity of PP2B for fragments of the anchoring protein . In order to calculate Kd values , untagged PP2B and Ca2+/CaM were used as competitors of AKAP79-phosphatase complexes . An N-terminal fragment of AKAP79 encompassing the LKIP motif bound PP2B with a Kd of 81 μM ( n = 4 ) as compared to binding affinities of 5 . 6 μM and 12 μM for the PIAIIIT region and the full-length AKAP respectively ( both n = 4; Figure 6E ) . These measurements further indicate that the PIAIIIT motif is the primary determinant for PP2B anchoring , whereas the LKIP region provides an auxiliary interaction . Mechanistic and crystallographic analysis of PP2B has identified two aromatic amino acids ( W352 and F356 ) that form a binding pocket for LxVP motifs ( Figure 6F ) ( Rodríguez et al . , 2009 ) . When both residues were substituted with alanine ( W352A/F356A ) , we noted that this mutant had reduced binding to the N-terminal fragment of AKAP79 in GST pulldown assays ( Figure 6G , top panel; lane 6 ) . Control experiments confirmed that the AKAP79 fragments encompassing the PIAIIIT motif retained the ability to bind wildtype and mutant PP2B ( Figure 6G top panel , lanes 7 and 8 ) . Together , these results indicate that the LKIP region on AKAP79 utilizes a similar mode of interaction analogous , but not identical to LxVP motifs . A recent study has suggested that residues immediately upstream of the LxVP core motif ( −1 and −2 positions ) contribute to PP2B-selective binding ( Sheftic et al . , 2016 ) . One clear distinction in the AKAP79/PP2B interface is that the anchoring protein utilizes distal PP2B binding determinants both upstream and downstream of the LKIP motif . A FRET biosensor of PP2B activity towards anchored substrates was used to investigate dynamic and bipartite interaction with AKAP79 inside cells ( Mehta et al . , 2014; Mehta and Zhang , 2014 ) . We reengineered the original calcineurin activity reporter ( CaNAR ) to utilize AKAP79 as the sole binding partner for PP2B . CaNAR reporter variants lacking the LKIP motif ( AKAP79∆L-CaNAR ) ; the PIAIIIT site ( AKAP79∆P-CaNAR ) and a double mutant ( AKAP79∆L∆P-CaNAR ) were also generated . Characterization included expression in HEK293 cells to confirm membrane targeting of each CaNAR construct ( Figure 7B ) and western blot analysis of AKAP79 immune complexes to detect co-precipitation of the phosphatase ( Figure 7C ) . These latter studies detected co-fractionation of PP2B only with AKAP79-CaNAR and AKAP79∆L-CaNAR ( Figure 7C , top panel , quantification in Figure 7D ) . Treatment with 1 μM ionomycin , which increases calcium permeability , augmented detection of PP2B ( Figure 7C , top panel , lanes 7 and 8 ) . Thus , engaging the LKIP motif favors a stable interaction with AKAP79 . Live-cell imaging was conducted over a time course of 12 min . Changes in YFP/CFP FRET ratio served as an index of PP2B activity ( Figure 7E and F ) . A sustained rise in FRET was evident upon stimulation with 1 μM ionomycin in cells expressing AKAP79-CaNAR ( Figure 7E , grey , n = 26 ) . Qualitatively similar FRET responses were observed with the AKAP79∆L-CaNAR reporter although the maximal effect was slightly reduced ( Figure 7E and F , orange , n = 31 ) . FRET responses were negligible in cells expressing AKAP79∆P-CaNAR that lacks the PIAIIIT motif ( Figure 7E and F , red , n = 14 ) . Maximal FRET responses from wild-type and AKAP79∆L-CaNAR constructs were not significantly different ( Figure 7F ) , yet rates of anchored PP2B activation varied . The AKAP79∆L-CaNAR variant reached half maximal response in 2 . 41 ± 0 . 24 min as compared to 3 . 58 ± 0 . 20 min for the full-length reporter ( Figure 7G ) . This change in kinetics did not depend on the expression level of the CaNAR reporter as determined by linear regression analysis of the data ( R-squared values of less than 0 . 1 , Figure 7—figure supplement 1 ) . We hypothesized that these differences are a consequence of increased sensitivity to calcium in the AKAP79∆L-CaNAR variant . Accordingly , when experiments were repeated with a ten-fold lower concentration of ionomycin ( 100 nM ) , the AKAP79∆L-CaNAR reporter exhibited statistically higher maximal FRET responses than the native reporter ( Figure 7H–J ) . Control imaging with the genetically encoded calcium indicator RCaMP confirmed that total calcium responses were equivalent in the presence of both modified CaNAR reporters ( Figure 7—figure supplement 1 ) . Collectively , these results indicate that the LKIP motif serves to desensitize PP2B towards low levels of calcium , while still allowing the anchored phosphatase to maintain maximal activity when calcium concentrations are elevated . Our modified CaNAR fusion reporter does not contain PP2B anchoring motifs ( LxVP or PxIxIT ) , therefore , our results suggest that the decrease is not due to competition for LxVP motifs . Rather , it is likely that upon Ca2+/CaM influx , engagement of the LKIP motif on AKAP79 stabilizes a conformation of PP2B that does not relieve auto-inhibition as readily as non-anchored phosphatase . Thus , we propose that the LKIP motif in AKAP79 serves to fine-tune the calcium sensitivity of anchored and active PP2B . Finally , we investigated whether interaction with AKAP79 affects the sensitivity of PP2B to immunosuppressant drugs . Rationale for this experiment was provided by evidence that the LKIP region of AKAP79 binds at the immunophilin-drug binding site on PP2B ( Figure 5E–G ) . Competition experiments performed with cyclosporin A/cyclophilin A cocktails ( 2 μM ) diminished binding of PP2B to the N-terminal region of AKAP79 as assessed by western blot ( Figure 8A–B; top panel , lane 4 ) . In contrast , the immunosuppressant drug had no effect on PP2B binding to AKAP79 fragments encompassing the PIAIIIT sequence ( Figure 8A–B , top panel , lanes 5–8 ) . Coomassie blue staining of AKAP79 fragments served as a loading control ( Figure 8A , bottom panel ) . Importantly , these results indicate that the LKIP motif and flanking determinants on AKAP79 not only modulate calcium responsive PP2B anchoring , but also may influence the clinical action of immunosuppressant drugs . 3 Discussion Although it is well established that anchored phosphatases and kinases modulate local signaling events , much less is known about structural and mechanistic features that contribute to this process . Using a combined negative-stain EM and chemical cross-linking strategy we discover that conformational flexibility within AKAP79-PP2B complexes is a fundamental element of their molecular action . A key facet of this emerging concept is that anchored signaling enzymes are not only tethered to subcellular organelles , but intrinsic disorder within ancillary targeting components confers a dynamic range of enzyme action . For example , flexible linker regions within each regulatory subunit ( RII ) of anchored Protein Kinase A ( PKA ) confer a ∼200 Å radius of motion to the associated catalytic subunits ( Smith et al . , 2013 ) . More recently we have shown that these anchored PKA holoenzymes remain intact , active and proximal to substrates within these newly defined signaling islands ( Smith et al . , 2017 ) . In other cellular contexts , association with AKAPs exerts allosteric effects that protect PKC isoforms from ATP-competitive inhibitors ( Hoshi et al . , 2010 ) . This may explain the mixed success of clinical trials with certain PKC inhibitors and how phosphorylation-dependent regulation of ion channels in the sympathetic nervous system is refractory to these small-molecule antagonists of PKC ( Bosma and Hille , 1989; Mochly-Rosen et al . , 2012 ) . These observations indicate that protein-protein interactions contribute to the substrate preference of these often-promiscuous enzymes , and in a broader context point towards intrinsic disorder and conformational flexibility as inherent specificity determinants of anchored enzyme scaffolds . Our findings expand on this concept , showing that unstructured regions within the prototypic anchoring protein AKAP79 contribute to targeting and modulation of protein phosphatase 2B . We have discovered short linear motifs ( SLiMS ) interspersed between regions of flexibility within AKAP79 that tailor phosphatase targeting interactions to permit local and dynamic control of protein dephosphorylation . Another new concept uncovered by our EM analyses is that phosphatase activation induces a topological reorganization of AKAP79-PP2B assemblies . We base this conclusion on single-particle EM evidence in Figure 3 showing that upon addition of Ca2+/calmodulin , dormant AKAP79-PP2B assemblies transition from an assortment of extended multi-lobal conformations into more globular structures . The crosslinking studies in Figure 5 implicate the PIAIIIT motif at residues 337–343 of AKAP79 as a stable PP2B-anchoring determinant that forms the conformational core for dormant assemblies . However , the bi-modal distribution in particle sizes highlighted in Figure 3C may reflect the differential deployment of other SLiMs that act synergistically with the PIAIIIT anchoring motif ( Grigoriu et al . , 2013; Rodríguez et al . , 2009; Roy et al . , 2007 ) . This configuration is radically altered upon activation with Ca2+/CaM as the aforementioned topological variants consolidate into a single population with a mean particle length of 178 Å . Hence , additional SLiMs are engaged within the active assembly to drive the formation of a more compact , but fully active phosphatase-anchoring protein unit . Crosslinking data presented in Figure 5B supports this finding , identifying four additional interactive surfaces between AKAP79 and the lower lobe of the catalytic core of the active phosphatase . In this study we focused on an 11-amino acid calcium-dependent interaction surface within AKAP79 that contacts the B subunit of PP2B . Although peptide array mapping in Figure 6 identifies binding determinants throughout this region , the predominant contact site is a Leu-Lys-Ile-Pro sequence located between residues 125–128 of the anchoring protein . There are several interesting features of this interactive surface . This sequence closely resembles an LxVP targeting motif that has been previously implicated in a variety of PP2B actions ( Escolano et al . , 2014; Nygren and Scott , 2016; Sheftic et al . , 2016 ) . The LxVP motif was originally identified as a rudimentary PP2B substrate recognition site that enhances dephosphorylation of the RII subunit of PKA ( Blumenthal et al . , 1986 ) . Subsequently , LxVP motifs were shown to augment PP2B binding and dephosphorylation of the NFAT transcription factors ( Grigoriu et al . , 2013; Rodríguez et al . , 2009 ) . More recently , a variation on this theme was reported in the MAP kinase scaffolding protein KSR2 where an LxVP motif is utilized in conjunction with intrinsic disorder to ensure efficient dephosphorylation of serine and threonine residues at sites distal to the PP2B binding site ( Brennan et al . , 2011; Dougherty et al . , 2009 ) . A parallel situation may arise in AKAP79 macromolecular assemblies , as flexibility surrounding the PP2B-binding regions of the anchoring protein may provide a means to extend the range of anchored phosphatase action . Scrutiny of type I phosphatase ( PP1 ) -targeting subunit co-crystal structures shows that the LKIP motif on AKAP79 is analogous to the MyPhonE or SILK motifs ( Hendrickx et al . , 2009 ) . These secondary binding determinants act in concert with RVxF targeting elements to manage the PP1 catalytic subunit in a variety of subcellular compartments ( Egloff et al . , 1997; Roy and Cyert , 2009 ) . Live cell imaging with AKAP79-CaNAR FRET reporters ( Figure 7D and E ) expand this concept by showing that a protein-protein interaction through LKIP sets distance parameters for anchored phosphatase activity that are contingent on the prior association of the PP2B A subunit with the PIAIIIT motif . Hence , the cooperative action of multiple enzyme-binding surfaces , along with the malleability of the AKAP , creates an elastic and adaptive signaling environment that permits the phosphatase to reach nearby substrates . Molecular docking using the Rosetta FlexPepDock program uncovers another intriguing feature of the LKIP motif on AKAP79 . This predictive approach reveals that the LKIP sequence recognizes a binding surface on PP2B utilized by the immunosuppressant drug cyclosporin ( Figure 5E–G; [Jin and Harrison , 2002] ) . This is borne out by competition experiments presented in Figure 7H showing that excess cyclosporin antagonizes AKAP79-phosphatase interaction . This finding may have implications for how this signaling complex operates in a variety of pathological contexts . For example , tissue-specific ablation of PP2B from β-cells generates a diabetic state that includes defects in NFAT transcriptional signaling , diminished insulin biosynthesis and a loss of islet mass ( Bernal-Mizrachi et al . , 2004; Heit et al . , 2006 ) . Likewise , organ transplant patients who continually receive the PP2B inhibitor drugs cyclosporin and FK506 as immunosuppressives often experience increased blood glucose levels and hypertension as hallmarks of a clinical syndrome known as new-onset diabetes after transplant ( Heisel et al . , 2004 ) . AKAP150 knockin mice that lack the PIAIIIT motif and incorrectly target the active phosphatase display improved glucose handling and heightened insulin sensitivity ( Hinke et al . , 2012 ) . This argues that mislocalization of PP2B is the predominant molecular event underlying these advantageous , albeit tissue-specific , metabolic phenotypes that counteract the symptoms of type II diabetes . Thus , small molecules or peptidomimetics that perturb PP2B tethering , but do not affect the catalytic activity , may boost insulin sensitivity ( Matsoukas et al . , 2015 ) . This theory is further consolidated by animal studies that deliver cell-permeable PxIxIT and LxVP peptides to achieve immunosuppression with fewer side effects ( Elloumi et al . , 2012; Escolano et al . , 2014; Noguchi et al . , 2004 ) . In conclusion , the structural insights in this study offer fresh mechanistic perspective on how AKAP79 assemblies influence calcium signaling . Live-cell imaging experiments in Figure 7 show that engagement of the LKIP sequence attenuates anchored phosphatase activity at low levels of calcium . Importantly , these effects are relieved upon increased calcium influx . Thus , proximity or direct association with L-type calcium channels , as reported by others , may profoundly influence the temporal action of the anchored phosphatase . This is particularly relevant in the cardiovascular system , where transient calcium fluctuation is pronounced within the vicinity of L-type calcium channel-AKAP79/150 clusters ( Nieves-Cintrón et al . , 2016; Nystoriak et al . , 2014; Nystoriak et al . , 2017 ) . A similar situation may arise in the brain where neuronal NMDA receptors , L-type calcium channels in the postsynaptic density of excitatory synapses and GABA receptors embedded within inhibitory synapses are reversibly controlled by AKAP79/150 associated pools of PKA , PKC and PP2B ( Brandon et al . , 2003; Colledge et al . , 2000; Jurado et al . , 2010; Li et al . , 2012; Oliveria et al . , 2007; Sanderson et al . , 2012 ) . With this in mind , we postulate LKIP motifs on AKAP79/150 differentially regulate PP2B responses to calcium stimulation and hence balance the role of CaMKII phosphorylation at synapses ( Derkach et al . , 1999; Mulkey et al . , 1994 ) . Our discovery that flexibility is a defining feature of AKAP79 complexes points toward a mechanism whereby combinatorial recruitment of binding partners tailors the overall conformation of the macromolecular assembly . Such structural versatility represents a new means to shape AKAP79/150 kinase-phosphatase assemblies for their customized physiological roles . 4 Materials and methods For all predictions , the amino acid sequence of human AKAP79 was used . Disorder predictions were obtained using default parameters on IUPred ( iupred . enzim . hu ) and PONDR ( pondr . com ) ( Dosztányi et al . , 2005; Li et al . , 1999 ) . Predictions of short linear interaction motifs were obtained using ANCHOR ( anchor . enzim . hu ) and SLiMPred ( bioware . ucd . ie ) ( Dosztányi et al . , 2009; Mooney et al . , 2012 ) . Graphs were prepared using Prism 6 . 0 ( GraphPad Software ) . All proteins were transformed and expressed in BL21 ( DE3 ) pLysS cells ( Life Technologies ) . AKAP79 was expressed as an MBP fusion in a modified pMAL c5x backbone ( NEB ) . In addition , a 10x His-tag was placed at the C-terminus of the AKAP79 sequence . AKAP79-transformed BL21 cultures were grown in Terrific Broth ( Sigma ) until OD600 = ~0 . 5 , and expression was then induced with 0 . 4 mM IPTG at 37˚C for 4 hr . Cells were then pelleted , frozen at −20˚C and thawed and resuspended in 30 mL/liter of culture Buffer A ( 200 mM NaCl , 20 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 5 ) 4 mg/mL lysozyme , 1 mM AEBSF , 2 μg/mL leupeptin , 16 μg/mL benzamidine . After resuspension , Triton X-100 was added to 0 . 5% , and benzonase ( Sigma-Aldrich ) was added at a 1:20 , 000 dilution . After incubation for an additional 30 min , the lysate was cleared by spinning at 20 , 000 rpm in an SA-600 rotor ( Sorvall ) for 30 min . Clarified lysate was incubated with nickel affinity resin ( Roche ) for 1 hr , and then allowed to flow through by gravity . 2 mL wash/elution fractions were collected and analyzed by Coomassie staining containing the following concentrations of imidazole: 10 , 20 , 30 , 50 , 75 , 100 , 250 , 500 mM ( x5 ) . Fractions containing MBP-AKAP79 were then combined and concentrated to <5 mL and applied to a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 gel filtration column for separation at 0 . 5 mL/min . The peak corresponding to soluble MBP-AKAP79 was pooled and concentrated and flash-frozen , then stored at −80˚C . GST-PP2B was cloned into the pGEX-6P1 backbone as a bicistronic expression vector containing a Shine-Dalgarno sequence between the A subunit and the B subunit . Calmodulin was also expressed as a GST fusion in the pGEX-6P1 vector . PP2B and calmodulin were both purified by affinity chromatography , the GST tag was cleaved and gel filtration chromatography was performed using a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 gel filtration column for PP2B and a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 75 gel filtration column for calmodulin . PP2B purified for use in subunit labeling or GST pulldown assays included a Flag tag located on the C-terminus of the catalytic subunit . Complexes were formed by incubating 1 mg of MBP-AKAP79 with PP2B and CaM in a 1:2 . 5:3 molar ratio overnight in buffer A supplemented with either 2 mM CaCl2 or 2 mM EDTA . These samples were then injected onto to a Superdex Increase 200 10/300 column ( GE ) or a HiLoad Superdex 200 preparative column using an AKTApurifier FPLC in buffer A with CaCl2 or EDTA . Peaks were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining . The first peak , which elutes after the void volume , was pooled for further experimental analysis . The SEC-MALS system used was an AKTApure FPLC ( GE ) , with an in-line Optilab T-Rex refractometer ( Wyatt ) , and a Dawn Heleos II light scattering instrument ( Wyatt ) . 500 μL of purified complex ( ~2 mg/mL ) was injected onto a WTC-050S5 SEC column ( Wyatt ) and eluted at 0 . 5 mL/min directly into the on-line MALS instruments . Data was collected and processed to determine molecular mass using Astra 6 ( Wyatt ) . Samples were stabilized for native PAGE analysis by crosslinking with 250 μM BS3 ( Thermo Fisher ) for 30 min at room temperature . The crosslinking reaction was quenched by addition of Tris , pH 8 . 0 to 0 . 5 mM . The sample was then applied to NativePAGE 4–16% Bis-Tris gels ( Life Tech . ) according to the manufacturers’ instructions . All western blots were performed by transferring samples from SDS-PAGE gels to nitrocellulose membranes at 1 . 00A for 36 min . Membranes were blocked in 5% milk in TBS/T plus 0 . 02% sodium azide . The following primary antibodies were used – mouse monoclonal anti-MBP-HRP 1:1000 ( NEB ) , mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG-HRP 1:4000 ( Sigma ) , rabbit polyclonal anti-AKAP79 C-terminus ( Millipore ) , rabbit polyclonal anti-PP2B A subunit ( Millipore ) , mouse monoclonal anti-PP2B B subunit ( Abcam ) , and rabbit polyclonal anti-CaM ( Santa Cruz ) . Blots were incubated in primary antibody dilutions overnight at 4˚C , and then washed 3 times for 5 min in TBS/T . Blots were then incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to HRP at 1:10 , 000 dilution for 1 hr at room temperature . After three more TBS/T washes , blots were developed and imaged . In order to prepare AKAP79/PP2B/CaM complexes for EM analysis , ~2 mg purified complex was concentrated to ~100 μL and applied to a continuous density/glutaraldehyde gradient . This gradient was prepared in 13 . 8 mL tubes , with 5–30% ( w/v ) glycerol and 0–0 . 15% glutaraldehyde ( Kastner et al . , 2008 ) . Samples were spun in an SW41Ti rotor ( Beckmann-Coulter ) at 35 , 000 rpm for 18 hr at 4˚C . The gradients were fractionated in ~200 uL aliquots and analyzed by SDS-PAGE . Fractions that contained a single stabilized band were selected for further analysis . For random conical tilt experiments , we used C-flat holey carbon support grids ( Protochips , prod #CF-2/ . 5–4C ) that were coated with a thin layer of carbon evaporated onto mica and then floated on ultrapure water . For other negative stain experiments , we used standard carbon support grids ( Ted Pella , G-400 ) coated with carbon by evaporation . All grids were glow discharged and then ~5 μL of sample was allowed to adsorb to the grid for approximately 20 s . Grids were then blotted dry and 2% uranyl formate was added for 2 min . After blotting excess uranyl formate and allowing to dry , grids were ready to image . Micrographs of untilted and −55˚ tilted views were acquired on a FEI T12 Spirit operated at 120 kV , spot size 5 , 52000x nominal magnification , pixel size 2 . 07 Å , defocus values between −0 . 7 and −1 . 5 μm , and a dose of 30 e-/Å2 . Data collection was automated using the MSI-RCT application within the Leginon software package ( Suloway et al . , 2005 ) . For 2-D analysis of labeled complexes , data was collected using the MSI-Raster application in Leginon . Fab fragments were generated from M2-anti-Flag mouse monoclonal ( Sigma ) and anti-MBP mouse monoclonal ( NEB ) antibodies by digestion with ficin or papain , respectively . After 6 hr digestion at 37˚C , digested material was incubated with protein-A agarose to capture Fc fragments and undigested whole IgG . Fab fragments were further purified using size-exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 gel filtration column . These fragments were then incubated with AKAP79/PP2B/CaM complexes overnight at 4˚C and subjected to an additional round of size exclusion chromatography . The elution fractions corresponding to labeled complexes were collected , pooled and subjected to GraFix preparation for negative stain EM . 1 . 4 nm Nanogold particles ( Nanoprobes ) were incubated in molar excess with AKAP79/PP2B/CaM complexes overnight at 4˚C in buffer A supplemented with calcium . Subsequently , the labeled complexes were separated using a Superdex 200 column , and diluted to prepare for negative stain EM . Data was processed in the Appion pipeline with the following programs ( Lander et al . , 2009 ) . Particles were picked using DoGPicker , and tilt-pairs were determined using AutoTiltPicker ( Voss et al . , 2009 ) . The contrast transfer function was determined using CTFFind ( Mindell and Grigorieff , 2003 ) , and corrected using the EMAN 1 . 9 phase flip method . Individual particles were clustered using Xmipp 3 cl2d reference-free alignment to yield initial sets ( Sorzano et al . , 2010 ) . After discarding classes with junk particles for several iterations , references were selected and used for reference-based alignment with the SPIDER AP MQ command ( Frank et al . , 1996 ) . These references were then used to create RCT volumes using SPIDER within the Appion interface . Eluted proteins in 1 mL of 20 mM HEPES pH 8 . 5 , 200 mM NaCl , and either 2 mM CaCl2 or 2 mM EDTA were crosslinked with 10 mM Biotin-Aspartate Proline-PIR n-hydroxyphthalimide ( BDP-NHP ) ( Weisbrod et al . , 2013 ) . As necessary , the pH was adjusted to ~8 . 0 with 100 μl of 200 mM HEPES pH 8 . 5 . The reaction was allowed to continue for 1 hr at room temperature . Crosslinked proteins were denatured by the addition of urea buffer ( 8 M urea , 100 mM Tris-Cl pH 8 . 0 ) , reduced ( 5 mM dithiothreitol , 30 min , 55˚C ) , and alkylated ( 15 mM iodoacetamide , 1 hr , dark , room temperature ) . Crosslinked proteins were then digested with sequencing grade trypsin ( Promega ) overnight at 37˚C . Resulting peptides were desalted with C18-SepPaks ( Waters ) and dried by vacuum centrifugation . Crosslinked peptides were injected onto an in-house pulled C8 column ( 3 μm , 200 Å , Magic ) and analyzed by Real-time analysis of crosslinked peptide technology ( ReACT ) ( Weisbrod et al . , 2013 ) . Spectra generated from ReACT were searched against a target-decoy database using SEQUEST ( Eng et al . , 1994 ) . The complete set of observed peptides is presented in Supplementary file 1 along with their Expect scores and PPM error for the best-scoring relationships observed for each peptide pair . Crosslinked sites were mapped to proteins using xiNet ( Combe et al . , 2015 ) . Crosslinked peptides on PP2B , the PP2B/cyclosporin complex , and the PP2B/LxVP complex were modeled using Pymol ( Schrödinger ) . RCT volume data was modeled using Chimera ( Pettersen et al . , 2004 ) , and crystal structures were fit in the maps using the Fit in Map command . The putative LxVP peptide in AKAP79 ( KSRLKIPCIKFPRG ) was computationally docked onto a crystallographic model of PP2B using the CABS-Dock server ( Blaszczyk et al . , 2016 ) . The peptide was assumed to form a random loop ( as suggested by previous predictions ) , and the known binding site for the PxIxIT motif was excluded from being a possible binding site . The lowest energy conformation was assumed to be the most accurate binding prediction . This was then used as the input for the Rosetta FlexPepDock server ( London et al . , 2011 ) , which refined the results to produce the final displayed model . Peptides were synthesized onto a cellulose membrane using the Intavis MultiPep solid-phase peptide synthesizer . After resolubilizing in ethanol , the peptides were overlaid with Flag-PP2B at ~1 mg/mL in 1% BSA/TBS-T in the presence of either 100 μg/mL CaM and 5 mM CaCl2 or 5 mM EDTA . After washes in TBS/T supplemented with calcium or EDTA , the dot blots were developed . GST protein-protein interaction assays were performed using glutathione beads saturated with purified fragments of AKAP79 . 2 μg Flag-PP2B was added to each sample , incubated for 2 hr , and then washed five times with RIPA buffer , followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting analysis . An LxVP peptide derived from NFATc1 or a scrambled control peptide was added to a final concentration of 200 μM during the incubation step . In some cases , a mutant form of Flag-PP2B was used , while in others , a pre-formed cyclosporin A/cyclophilin A complex was used as a competitor ( 2 μM ) . After the final wash , PP2B activity buffer ( Promega ) was added and a phosphopeptide substrate ( Promega ) was included to measure phosphatase activity in these samples . Alphascreen competition assays were performed in 25 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 5 , 100 mM NaCl , 0 . 1% BSA , 3 mM CaCl2 , 2 μg/mL CaM . 10 μL of biotinylated PP2B and 10 μL of a His-tagged AKAP79 fragment ( final concentration of each - 100 nM ) were mixed and incubated for 15 min . 10 μL serial dilutions of untagged PP2B were added to the wells for 15 min and then Alphascreen beads ( streptavidin donor , and nickel acceptor; Perkin-Elmer ) were added and incubated for 60 min . Following this , the AlphaScreen signal was detected using a BMG PolarStar Omega plate reader . Data was analyzed using Prism 6 . 0 ( GraphPad ) , and fit using a one-site IC50 model . Because of the concentrations used , the IC50 is able to approximate the Kd value of the interaction . AKAP79 was fused to the N-terminal of the CaNAR2 sequence in the pcDNA 3 . 1 backbone . Mutation of the PxIxIT motif in NFAT ( PRIEIT ) to PRAEAT was done to abolish direct PP2B binding . Fusing a short peptide from AKAP79 to the CaNAR2 sequence and testing whether this was capable of producing a FRET response to ionomycin confirmed the sufficiency of the AKAP79 PxIxIT motif . After fusing the full-length sequence of AKAP79 to CaNAR , mutants were made which were lacking residues 122–136 , 337–343 , or both . HEK293 cells were seeded on 12 mm poly-D-lysine and laminin coated coverslips ( Fisher ) and transfected with 0 . 3 μg of the wild type and mutant CaNAR reporter constructs . After 48 hr , cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min and permeabilized for 1 hr in PBS with 0 . 1% Triton X-100 . Coverslips were blocked in PBS with 10% donkey serum for 2 hr at room temperature before primary antibody staining overnight with mouse anti-PP2B antibody ( BD Biosciences ) . Samples were washed 3x and incubated with goat anti-mouse Alexafluor-555 secondary antibody . Nuclei were stained with DRAQ5 ( Cell Signaling Technology ) for 15 min at room temperature and then washed 3x before mounting in ProLong Gold anti-fade reagent ( Invitrogen ) onto glass microscope slides . Maximum projection images were acquired with a Zeiss scanning laser confocal microscope using a 63X oil immersion objective . HEK293 cells were obtained from GE Life Sciences ( Cat . # HCL4517 ) , maintained separately from other cells and were screened weekly to confirm the absence of mycoplasma contamination . As the origin of the cells was not central to the nature of these experiments , we did not further validate the identity of the HEK293 cells . 2 μg of each AKAP79-CaNAR variant were transfected into HEK293 cells for 48 hr . Cells were lysed in IP buffer ( 0 . 5% NP-40 , 100 mM NaCl , 50 mM Tris-HCl , pH 7 . 4 ) supplemented with protease inhibitors . After lysates were cleared , they were incubated with 2 μg of mouse anti-GFP ( Life Technologies ) , and 25 μL of protein A/G agarose for 2 hr . Following this , the beads were washed in IP buffer 3x and then SDS sample buffer was added . The samples were run on SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose for western blotting as described above . 15 μg of lysate was used as an input . CaNAR2pax was generated by substituting the isoleucine residues at positions 115 and 117 within the NFAT domain of CaNAR2 ( Mehta et al . , 2014 ) with alanines ( 113-PRIEIT-118 to 113-PRAEAT-118 ) via site-directed mutagenesis , thereby eliminating the endogenous calcineurin-docking PxIxIT motif . AKAP-tethered CaNAR2pax constructs were subsequently generated by PCR-amplifying full-length wild-type AKAP79 , AKAP79ΔLKIP , AKAP79ΔPIX , and AKAP79ΔLKIPΔPIX using HindIII/BamHI-linker primers and ligating the resulting PCR fragments into HindIII/BamHI-digested CaNAR2pax in pcDNA3 , yielding AKAP79WT-CaNAR2pax , AKAP79ΔLKIP-CaNAR2pax , AKAP79ΔPIX-CaNAR2pax , and AKAP79ΔLKIPΔPIX-CaNAR2pax , respectively . All constructs were verified by sequencing . HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco minimal Eagle Medium ( Gibco ) containing 1 g/L D-glucose and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum ( Sigma ) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin ( Sigma-Aldrich ) . Cells were maintained at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 . Prior to imaging experiments , cells were plated onto sterile 35 mm glass-bottom dishes , transfected with the indicated biosensor constructs at 70–80% confluency using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) , and then grown for an additional 48 hr . HeLa cells were obtained from ATCC ( Cat . #CCL-2 ) , maintained separately from other cells and were screened weekly to confirm the absence of mycoplasma contamination . As the origin of the cells was not central to the nature of these experiments , we did not further validate the identity of the HeLa cells . Cells were washed twice with Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution ( Gibco ) supplemented with 20 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 4 , and 2 . 0 g/L D-glucose , then imaged in the dark at 37°C . Ionomycin ( Calbiochem ) was prepared at a stock concentration of 1 mM in DMSO and directly added to imaging dishes at the indicated concentrations . Images were acquired on an Zeiss Axio Observer . Z1 microscope ( Zeiss ) equipped with a 40x/1 . 3 NA oil-immersion objective lens , a Definite Focus system ( Zeiss ) , and an electron-multiplying cooled charge-coupled device camera ( Roper Scientific ) controlled by Metafluor 7 . 7 software ( Molecular Devices ) . Dual emission ratio imaging was performed using a 420DF20 excitation filter , a 450DRLP dichroic mirror , and two emission filters ( 475DF40 for CFP and 535DF25 for YFP ) . Filter sets were alternated using a Lambda 10–2 filter changer ( Sutter Instruments ) . Exposure times were 50–500 ms , and images were acquired every 30 s ."}

However , research has largely focused on sensory deprivation and maladaptive change . Here we show that adaptive patterns of limb usage after amputation drive cortical plasticity .

Using fMRI , we show that the deprived sensorimotor cortex is employed by whichever limb individuals are over-using . Individuals from either group that rely more on their intact hands ( and report less frequent residual arm usage ) showed increased intact hand representation in the deprived cortex , and increased white matter fractional anisotropy underlying the deprived cortex , irrespective of the age at which deprivation occurred . Our results demonstrate how experience-driven plasticity in the human brain can transcend boundaries that have been thought to limit reorganisation after sensory deprivation in adults .", "plain language summary": "The loss of a limb will have a profound impact on an individual’s daily life . Nevertheless , individuals can employ a variety of behavioural strategies to adapt to the loss of , say , a hand . Some become skilled at using the residual part of their arm , while others prefer to rely on their other hand . Their brain , too , will undergo major changes . Many studies have shown that the region of the brain that controlled a given limb can be “taken over” by another part of the body if that limb is lost . This process has been previously considered to be harmful , as it has been linked to experiences of pain arising from the missing limb . Now , Makin et al . have explored the links between changes in the behaviour of individuals missing a hand and changes in their brains . People who had been born without a hand or who had lost a hand in later life were asked to wear a device that recorded their movements as they went about their daily lives . The data revealed that people who had been born without a hand made relatively more use of their residual limb , while those who had lost their hand made relatively more use of their remaining hand . Moreover , these differences were reflected in patterns of brain activity . In the subjects born without a hand ( who were making relatively extensive use of their residual limb ) , the area of the brain that would otherwise control the ‘missing’ hand was activated when the subjects moved their residual limb . And in the subjects who had lost their hand , this brain region was activated when they moved their remaining hand . However , in individual subjects , the size of the effect depended on the usage preferences of the subject: for example , the minority of people who were born without a hand but nevertheless make extensive use of their intact hand showed a pattern of activation that resembled the average pattern seen in those who had lost a hand in later life . By providing new insights into the plasticity of brain and behaviour following the loss of a hand , the work of Makin et al . may aid the development of rehabilitation techniques to help patients to optimise the use of both their residual and their intact limbs .", "article": "1 Introduction After losing a hand , simple tasks such as tying your shoelaces become a daily challenge , resulting in serious implications for quality of life and employment ( Jang et al . , 2011 ) . How do different individuals adapt to such challenges , and what role does brain plasticity play in this adaptation ? By addressing these questions in individuals with congenital or acquired hand absence we hope to shed light on the scope for adaptive plasticity in the adult human brain , thereby providing important information for informing future neurorehabilitation strategies . It has been thought that adaptive plasticity is restricted in the adult primary sensory cortex following sensory deprivation , as shown recently in late blindness ( Baseler et al . , 2011 ) , suggesting limited scope for neurorehabilitation following sensory deprivation . Arm-amputation is a particularly powerful model for studying plasticity as it combines two major drivers for reorganisation – sensory deprivation and adaptive motor behaviour . Despite this , most accounts of plasticity following arm amputation focused on sensory deprivation , and in particular on apparently passive remapping of adjacent face or arm representation into the deprived cortex ( Lotze et al . , 1999; Ramachandran and Altschuler , 2009; Nava and Röder , 2011 ) . Although longer-range remapping has also been reported , such as intact hand representation in the deprived cortex ( Bogdanov et al . , 2012 ) , this is usually also explained as a passive result of inter-hemispheric dis-inhibition ( Werhahn et al . , 2002; Ramachandran and Altschuler , 2009; Simões et al . , 2012 ) . However , these accounts ignore substantial adaptations in motor behaviour that accompany absence or loss of a limb , which could be powerful drivers for plasticity ( Scholz et al . , 2009 ) . Here , we test whether altered limb–use patterns influence cortical reorganisation in individuals with unilateral hand absence , using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) and diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) . One aim of the current study was to assess upper limb use strategies in individuals with acquired and congenital hand absence . A further aim was to investigate whether functional cortical reorganisation underlies any observed variation in motor behaviour . Specifically , we predicted that the degree to which individuals used their residual-arm or intact-hand in daily life would reflect the degree of brain activity in the deprived cortex during movement of the corresponding limb . 2 Results We assessed day-to-day limb-use strategies in individuals with acquired ( n = 18 , 10 below elbow ) or congenital ( n = 11 , 10 below elbow ) hand absence ( see Table 1 for demographic details and prosthetic limb usage ) . Specifically , we quantified the extent to which individuals utilise their residual arms , relative to their intact hands ( Figure 1A ) , in daily activities . We collected data from acceleration monitors , worn by a sub-set of 20 participants ( 8 congenital ) while engaged in their normal routines . A laterality index , reflecting the relative number of movements performed by the intact hand vs the residual arm ( Figure 1B ) , showed that both groups moved the intact hand more than the residual arm ( t ( 7 ) = 3 . 48 , p=0 . 01; t ( 11 ) = 10 . 60 , p=0 . 001 , one-sample t-test compared to zero for the congenital and acquired groups , respectively ) . This could be due both to greater use of the intact hand and also to the different position of the accelerometer on the two sides of the body ( wrist vs arm ) , resulting in different acceleration profiles . Our main aim was to compare the degree of this laterality across the two 1-handed groups . We found that the acquired group exhibited stronger relative reliance on their intact hand , as demonstrated in a significantly greater lateralisation scores towards the intact hand , compared to the congenital group ( t ( 18 ) = −2 . 67 , p=0 . 016 , Figure 1B ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 01273 . 003Table 1 .

Dissociative limb usage strategies in 1-handed individuals with congenital and acquired hand loss . ( A ) Schematic illustration of the residual and intact limbs . ( B ) Limb-use strategies , based on activity monitors for increased lateralised ( intact hand ) use . A laterality index , reflecting the relative number of movements performed by the intact hand vs the residual limb , was calculated using data from acceleration monitors ( mean ± s . e . m . ) , worn by 20 1-handed individuals ( 8 congenital ) while engaged in their normal routines . Positive values represent a tendency to use the intact hand more than the residual limb . Although both groups exhibit such a tendency ( t ( 7 ) = 3 . 48 , p=0 . 01; t ( 11 ) = 10 . 60 , p=0 . 001 , one-sample t-test compared to zero for the congenital and acquired groups , respectively ) , the acquired group shows a significantly greater preference for the intact hand compared to the congenital group ( t ( 18 ) = −2 . 67 , p=0 . 016 ) . ( C ) Questionnaire ratings ( mean ± s . e . m . ) for residual arm usage in daily activities were significantly greater for the congenital group ( t ( 1 , 27 ) = 3 . 65 , p=0 . 001 ) , suggesting they use their residual arm more frequently in daily activities , compared with the acquired group . ( D ) Questionnaire ratings for residual arm usage were negatively correlated with the laterality indices , measured based on acceleration monitoring ( r ( 20 ) = −0 . 53 , p=0 . 012 ) , validating the questionnaires as a measurement of habitual usage strategies between the residual and intact limbs . Scatter plot shows data for 1-handed individuals with congenital and acquired hand loss , frequency of prosthetic hand usage is indicated in the index to the right . Asterisks denote significance levels of *p<0 . 05; ***p<0 . 005 . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 01273 . 004 These findings were further confirmed using questionnaire ratings from all 1-handed participants , quantifying the extent to which individuals incorporate their residual arm in daily tasks ( ‘Materials and methods’ ) . Ratings were significantly greater for the congenital group ( t ( 1 , 27 ) = 3 . 65 , p=0 . 001 ) , suggesting they use their residual arm more frequently in their daily routine , compared with the acquired group ( Figure 1C ) . This group difference remained significant after accounting for level of amputation and degree of functional and cosmetic prosthetic limb usage as covariates ( F ( 1 , 24 ) = 8 . 217 , p=0 . 009 ) . The questionnaire ratings for residual arm usage were negatively correlated with the accereometry-based laterality indices ( r ( 18 ) = −0 . 53 , p=0 . 012 , Figure 1D ) , validating the questionnaires as a measurement of habitual usage strategies between the residual and intact limbs . A similar correlation was also obtained after accounting for level of amputation and degree of functional and cosmetic prostheses usage ( r ( 15 ) = −0 . 451 , p=0 . 034 ) . Based on these dissociated adaptive motor strategies , we predicted distinct patterns of limb representation between the two 1-handed groups . All 1-handed participants and 22 intact ( 2-handed ) controls underwent fMRI , involving simple unilateral hand and arm movements ( fingers/elbow flexion and extension ) . Voxel-wise activation ( β ) patterns were compared between the three groups during hand and arm movements across the entire brain . Each of these two separate whole-brain contrasts resulted in a single cluster , centred on the hand knob of the central sulcus of the deprived hemisphere , spanning both the pre- and the post-central gyri . In line with their increased usage of the residual arm , congenital 1-handed participants showed increased activation during residual arm movements , compared with the other two groups ( Figure 2B ) . The resulting cluster showed two distinct local peaks of activation—in the anterior and posterior banks of the central sulcus ( t = 3 . 73; x = 38 , y = −20 , z = 54 for the anterior peak and t = 3 . 93; x = 48 , y = −20 , z = 54 for the posterior peak , coordinates are based on the MNI 152 brain template ) . Conversely , acquired 1-handed participants , who displayed increased use of their intact hand , correspondingly showed significantly increased activation during intact hand movements compared to the other groups ( Figure 2C ) . The resulting cluster had a single peak , centred on the posterior bank of the central sulcus ( t = 5 . 24; x = 42 , y = −18 , z = 48 in MNI 152 space ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 01273 . 005Figure 2 . Limb-representation patterns in the deprived cortex reflect usage—whole brain contrasts .

( B ) Whole-brain group comparisons for activation during residual/nondominant arm movements ( in 1-handed/control participants , respectively; deprived hemisphere is in front . Note that participants with above elbow deprivation were excluded ) . During movements of the residual arm , the congenital group showed increased activation compared with the acquired and control groups . This whole-brain contrast resulted in a single cluster , centred on the hand knob of the central sulcus of the deprived cortex , spanning the pre- and post-central gyri ( shown in orange ) . ( C ) Whole-brain group comparisons for activation during intact/dominant hand movements ( in 1-handed/control participants , respectively ) . During movements of the intact hand , the acquired group showed increased activation compared with the conjunction of the congenital and control groups . This whole-brain contrast resulted in a single cluster centred on the hand knob of the deprived cortex spanning the pre- and post-central gyri ( shown in orange ) . The square inserts in ( B and C ) show overlap between the clusters resulting from the whole brain group comparisons ( orange ) and the controls’ hand area ( white ) , as shown in ( A ) . No other significant clusters were identified here , or using the homologous contrasts between the other groups . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 01273 . 005 Even though activations used to generate these two contrasts were measured during movements of different limbs ( hand vs arm ) , and on different sides of the body ( limbless side vs intact side ) , the differential activation was restricted in both cases to the hand area , as demonstrated by activation patterns in the control group ( Figure 2A and inserts in Figure 2B , C ) . No other significant clusters were identified in these comparisons , or using the homologous contrasts between the other groups . As demonstrated in Figure 2 , the two independent clusters , showing increased representation of the residual arm or the intact hand in the congenital and acquired groups , overlapped with the hand area of the control participants . This suggests that the area that would typically represent the missing hand has been recruited to support increased representation of the residual arm or intact hand . To investigate use-dependent plasticity specifically in the ‘deprived cortex’ , we constructed an independent region of interest ( ROI ) , based on the conjunction between phantom/nondominant hand movements in acquired amputees/2-handed controls . Amputees often experience vivid sensations of a phantom hand . Recently , this phenomenology has been supported by empirical evidence demonstrating that movements of a phantom limb elicit both central and peripheral motor signals that are different from those found during imagined movement ( Reilly et al . , 2006; Raffin et al . , 2012 ) . This phenomenon of maintained representation in the sensorimotor cortex , allowed us to reliably localise the representation of the missing hand ( Makin et al . , 2013 ) . Here , this pre-defined ROI was used to interrogate activity relating to other body parts , thus allowing us to test the usage-driven hypotheses independently . The borders of this ‘deprived cortex’ ROI , spanning primary somatosensory and motor cortices , are shown in Figure 3A . As the spatial resolution and co-registration methods used here are insufficient to reliably dissociate the somatosensory and motor primary cortices , cortical areas spanning the pre- and post-central gyri will be described here as ‘sensorimotor’ . 10 . 7554/eLife . 01273 . 006Figure 3 . Limb-representation patterns in the deprived cortex reflect usage—ROI analysis . ( A ) To define the deprived cortex , an independent ROI ( outline shown in black ) was derived from the conjunction between phantom/nondominant hand movements in acquired amputees/controls . For illustration purposes , the group contrast maps derived from the previous whole-brain analysis ( shown in Figure 2 ) are also overlaid ( in faded orange ) , highlighting the fact that whole-brain group differences are co-localised with the deprived cortex ROI . ( B and C ) In order to assess the degree to which the deprived cortex is used to represent other body parts , mean fMRI activation levels ( β ) for voxels within the deprived cortex ROI during residual arm ( B ) and intact hand ( C ) movements were calculated . Beta values were averaged ( ±s . e . m ) across the congenital ( white ) , acquired ( light gray ) and control ( black ) groups . Within-group comparisons confirmed greater representation of the relatively over-used limb in each group . Asterisks/Hashes denote significance levels of *p≤0 . 025; **p<0 . 005; #p<0 . 05 for corrected ( planned ) /and uncorrected ( exploratory ) comparisons , respectively . ( D ) Increased fMRI activation ( β ) in the deprived cortex during intact hand movements correlated negatively with questionnaire scores for residual arm usage ( associated with increased intact hand usage , Figure 1D ) , across the congenital and acquired groups ( r ( 28 ) = −0 . 43 , p=0 . 021 ) . Prostheses usage indices are shown in Figure 1 . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 01273 . 006 We next extracted fMRI activation values ( β ) during movement conditions within the independent ROI . A mixed effect analysis of variance showed a significant interaction between groups and limbs ( F ( 2 , 47 ) = 3 . 67 , p=0 . 033 ) , reflecting dissociated recruitment of the deprived cortex by movements of the residual arm and intact hand in the two 1-handed groups ( Figure 3B–C ) . Post-hoc tests confirmed increased activation when congenital participants moved their ( relatively over-used ) residual limb , compared to acquired participants ( Mann Whitney U = 6 , n = 20 , p=0 . 001 ) and compared to controls ( t ( 30 ) = 2 . 37 , p=0 . 025 ) . Similarly , greater activation within the deprived cortex was observed when acquired participants moved their ( relatively over-used ) intact hand , compared to congenital participants ( t ( 26 ) = −3 . 68 , p=0 . 001 ) and controls ( t ( 37 ) = 2 . 96 , p=0 . 005 ) . These results were independent of participant A07 , who lost her hand at a young age ( t>2 . 81 , p<0 . 008 ) ( note that this participant was not included in the arm analysis above , due to her amputation level ) . The difference between the two 1-handed groups was also significant when accounting for level of amputation , and degree of functional and cosmetic prosthetic limb usage ( F ( 1 , 15 ) = 11 . 357 , p=0 . 004 and F ( 1 , 23 ) = 8 . 172 , p=0 . 009 for residual arm and intact hand movements , respectively ) . To complement the between-group findings reported above , we also performed within-group analyses to test for assymetrical patterns of limb representation . In particular , we tested whether the activity in the deprived cortex during movement of the over-used ( compensatory ) limb was greater than activity in the homologous cortex ( in the intact hemipshere ) during movements of the corresponding ( opposite ) limb ( Figure 4 ) . For the congenital group , activation in the deprived cortex during movements of the ( contralateral ) residual arm was greater than activation in the homolgous intact cortex during movements of the ( contralateral ) intact arm ( t ( 1 , 9 ) = 2 . 45 , p=0 . 037 ) . Similarly , for the acquired group , activation in the deprived cortex during movements of the ( ipsilateral ) intact hand was greater than activation in the homologous intact cortex during movements of the ( ipsilateral ) phantom hand ( Makin et al . , 2013 ) ( t ( 1 , 16 ) = 3 . 08 , p=0 . 007 ) . These results confirm that , within both groups , activity in the deprived cortex relating to the compensatory limb is greater than activity in the homologous cortex , relating to the corresponding opposite limb . 10 . 7554/eLife . 01273 . 007Figure 4 . Over-representation of the favoured limb for adaptive use results in intra-subject assymetry . Activation levels ( mean ± s . e . m ) during arm movements in the congenital group and during hand movements in the deprived cortex ROI ( white ) , and a homologous ROI contralateral to the intact hand ( gray ) . The congenital group showed increased contralateral activation ( in the deprived cortex ) during residual arm movements , compared to contralateral activation ( in the homolgous intact cortex ) during intact arm movements . The acquired group demonstrated significantly increased ipsilateral activation ( in the deprived cortex ) when moving their intact hand , compared with ipsilateral activation ( in the intact cortex ) during phantom hand movements . These results confirm adaptive changes in limb-representation in the deprived cortex in 1-handed individuals . Asterisks denote significance levels of *p<0 . 05; **p<0 . 01 . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 01273 . 007 In addition to the hypothesised increase in activation for the limb favoured for adaptive usage , the ROI analysis in Figure 3B–C also revealed unexpected reduced activation in the 1-handed groups during movements of the limb which is not favoured for over-use , compared with controls . Specifically , the congenital group , who over-use the residual arm , showed reduced activation in the deprived cortex during movements of the intact hand ( t ( 31 ) = −2 . 61 , p=0 . 014 ) , whereas the acquired group , who over-use the intact hand , showed reduced activation in the deprived cortex during movements of the residual arm ( Mann Whitney U = 97 , n = 39 , p=0 . 025 ) . This result potentially reflects a competitive relationship between the representations of the two limbs in the deprived cortex in 1-handed individuals . To test whether functional reorganisation associated with adaptive movement strategies is present outside the primary sensorimotor cortex , we also explored patterns of limb representation in the cerebellar hand area ( lobule V of the anterior lobe ) of the acquired and congenital 1-handed groups . We defined an independent ROI for the deprived cerebellum , using the same criteria as used to construct the deprived cortex ROI . Note that the deprived cerebellum ROI is ipsilateral to the missing hand ( and opposite to the deprived cortex ROI ) . Similarly to the deprived cortex , the deprived cerebellum showed increased activation in the congenital group during residual arm movements ( t ( 26 ) = −3 . 33 , p=0 . 003 ) , and increased activation in the acquired group during intact hand movement ( t ( 18 ) = 2 . 75 , p=0 . 013 ) . This suggests that the patterns of altered representation identified in this study are not limited to reorganisation of body-part representations in the primary sensorimotor cortex . For the group results described above , we have compared the intact hand of 1-handed participants to the dominant hand of controls , and the residual arm of 1-handed participants to the non-dominant arm of controls . However , a third of the individuals with acquired deprivation lost their dominant hand ( Table 1 ) . To test whether group differences in hand dominance could influence the results , activation levels for non-dominant hand and dominant arm movements were extracted from a homologous ROI contralateral to the dominant hand , in an age-matched sub-group of the control participants . ROI-based comparisons between the acquired and control groups were repeated as above , while accounting for handedness using this sub-group , with similar results ( t ( 30 ) = 3 . 1 , p=0 . 004 for increased representation during intact hand movements and t ( 37 ) = −2 . 25 , p=0 . 032 for decreased residual arm representation during residual arm movements in acquired amputees vs controls ) . Phantom limb pain , prevalent in acquired amputees , may discourage these participants from using their residual arm . Indeed , within the acquired group a trend for a correlation between chronic phantom pain scores and usage was found ( r ( 16 ) = −0 . 40 , p=0 . 099 ) , such that individuals with worst chronic pain tend to use their residual arm less . Therefore , to test whether phantom pain could explain our observed imaging results , we repeated the comparisons between the two 1-handed groups described above ( using a univariate GLM ) with chronic phantom pain ratings as a covariate . Increased activation was maintained both in the congenital group ( relative to the acquired group ) during residual arm movements ( F ( 1 , 19 ) = 12 . 57 , p=0 . 002 ) and in the acquired group ( relative to the congenital group ) during intact hand movements ( F ( 1 , 27 ) = 6 . 10 , p=0 . 021 ) . These results suggest that the activation patterns presented above are not merely epiphenomenal to phantom pain . Although the congenital and acquired 1-handed groups differed in terms of usage strategies and activation patterns in the deprived cortex , individuals across these groups showed considerable overlap ( Figure 3D ) : acquired 1-handed individuals who nevertheless had high residual arm usage showed less of the intact hand activation that was typical of their group . Such individuals demonstrate that the differential reorganisational patterns observed in the two 1-handed groups may not be solely determined by deprivation age ( or previous afferent/efferent experience ) , but rather could relate to usage strategies . Indeed , when considering usage across both 1-handed groups we found that greater usage of the residual arm was associated with less activation during intact hand movements in the deprived cortex ( r ( 26 ) = −0 . 43 , p=0 . 021 ) , even when accounting for age of sensory deprivation ( r ( 25 ) = −0 . 36 , p=0 . 032 ) . This effect was strengthened when repeating the same partial correlation while only considering the prosthetic limb users ( r ( 19 ) = −0 . 61 , p=0 . 003 and r ( 18 ) = −0 . 56 , p=0 . 005 , respectively ) , suggesting that rehabilitation may strengthen the relationship between adaptive plasticity and usage , however further research will be required to identify the relationship between prosthesis usage and adaptive brain plasticity . Finally , the white matter connections supporting the functional changes associated with limb-usage were studied in voxel-wise comparisons ( Smith et al . , 2006 ) of fractional anisotropy ( FA , a measure of white matter microstructure ) , along the white matter skeleton . No significant differences in FA were found between the three groups , suggesting that deprivation in itself may be insufficient to induce significant white matter change ( although see Langer et al . ( 2012 ) for a study showing reduced FA in the corticospinal tract following several weeks of arm immobilisation ) . However , across both 1-handed groups , individuals showing greater activation in the deprived cortex during intact hand movements had higher FA values in the corticospinal tract and the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus ( IFO ) in the deprived hemisphere ( Figure 5 ) . This voxel-wise non-parametric correlation was performed while accounting for participants’ age and deprivation age ( as nuisance regressors ) . No significant correlations were identified between FA and degree of activation in the deprived cortex during residual arm movements . 10 . 7554/eLife . 01273 . 008Figure 5 . Higher FA is associated with greater intact hand plasticity in 1-handed participants . Clusters in the corticospinal tract ( top ) and the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus ( bottom ) ( red-yellow , p<0 . 05 , corrected ) show positive correlations between FA and intact hand fMRI activation within the deprived cortex ROI ( blue ) , while accounting for participants’ age and deprivation age . The bright/dark green lines denote the white matter skeleton/tracts ( based on the John Hopkins University atlas ) , respectively . Clusters have been dilated for presentation purposes . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 01273 . 008 3 Discussion We provide the first evidence that altered patterns of adaptive limb use , in individuals with unilateral hand absence , are reflected in distinct patterns of cortical reorganization . Using physiological measurements , we provide the first detailed description of patterns of daily limb usage in individuals with congenital and acquired limb-loss . Next , using fMRI we show that representation patterns in the deprived cortex of 1-handed individuals are contingent upon the limb-use strategy adopted by individuals , rather than a sensitive period in development: Individuals from either 1-handed group that rely more on their intact hands showed increased representation of the ( ipsilateral ) intact hand in the deprived cortex , irrespective of age at deprivation . These functional adaptations are further reflected in white matter structural integrity , as demonstrated using DTI . These findings shed new light on the extent of adult brain plasticity and have implications for rehabilitation . Loss of a limb can have devastating impact on quality of life in individuals who are typically young , employed and otherwise healthy . As a result of limb loss , 69% of sufferers have to change job or become unemployed ( Jang et al . , 2011 ) . How best to rehabilitate these individuals , and allow them to return to active and productive lifestyles , is unknown ( Nimhurchadha et al . , 2013 ) . While tremendous resources are dedicated to aiding 1-handed populations through the development of sophisticated prosthetic limbs ( Kuiken et al . , 2009 ) , a relatively large number of the individuals do not use them and prefer to carry out daily activities with their intact hand ( Jang et al . , 2011; Østlie et al . , 2012 ) . Clinicians are aware that different individuals adapt to limblessness in varying ways–with some relying on the intact limb ( Jones and Davidson , 1999 ) and others showing remarkable ability with their residual limb or a prosthetic limb ( Smurr et al . , 2008; Jang et al . , 2011 ) . Surprisingly , however , to our knowledge there has been no previous empirical study of the range of adaptive motor behaviours taken in 1-handed individuals in their natural environment ( Lindner et al . , 2010 ) . Based on subjective ( questionnaires ) and objective ( accelerometry ) usage monitoring , we provide empirical data on patterns of limb usage in these groups while engaged in their natural routine ( Figure 1 ) and then show that these daily usage strategies are a powerful driver of plasticity in the deprived cortex . Development of compensatory skills , whether through rehabilitation or through the natural course of adaptation , critically depends on learning and brain plasticity . Previous studies of maladaptive brain changes after amputation ( Flor et al . , 1995 ) have been instrumental in guiding new evidence-based rehabilitation interventions to treat phantom pain ( Chan et al . , 2007; Lotze et al . , 1999 ) . However , the study of brain changes after amputation has not previously been brought to bear on the clinical problem of adaptive motor behaviour . Understanding the scope for adult human brain plasticity is a key consideration for designing successful future neurorehabilitation approaches ( Krakauer , 2006; Koenig et al . , 2013 ) . We found that patterns of increased representation of displaced body parts in the deprived cortex closely relate to adaptive daily strategies of limb-usage in individuals with upper limb absence: people with congenital hand absence , who are better at incorporating their residual arms in daily tasks , activate their missing hand cortex during residual arm movements ( Figures 2B , 3B , 4 ) . This is consistent with previous reports of reorganisation associated with compensatory foot-use in individuals with bilateral congenital upper limb malformation ( Stoeckel et al . , 2009 ) . Conversely , the 1-handed individuals with acquired amputation , who are more dependent on their intact hands for daily activities , show strong activation in their deprived cortex when the intact hand is moving ( Figures 2C , 3C , 4 ) . However , this dissociative representation doesn’t exclusively rely on the cause of or age at deprivation: increased ipsilateral intact hand representation was associated with the usage strategy adopted by individuals ( Figure 3D ) , such that people who have learned to incorporate their residual arms in daily tasks tended to show reduced intact hand representation in the deprived cortex . Using both whole-brain and ROI analyses , our functional results demonstrate how plasticity within the deprived cortex may be shaped by adaptive experience . However , it is possible that adaptive strategies for compensatory limb-usage drive similar , yet subtler differences in other brain areas underlying limb usage . For example , using an ROI analysis , we have identified similar patterns of limb over-representation in the deprived cerebellum , which were not apparent in the ( corrected ) whole-brain comparison . We therefore cannot rule out the possibility that habitual usage strategies could produce further changes in brain representation , beyond the deprived cortex and even the sensorimotor system . Further research is therefore necessary in order to determine the full extent of adaptive plasticity following limb-loss . Finally , while no group differences in FA values were identified , the degree of intact hand representation in the deprived cortex correlated with FA values along the IFO and the corticospinal tracts of the deprived cortex ( Figure 5 ) . The IFO has been recently implicated in visuospatial representation , as well as visuomotor control ( Urbanski et al . , 2008; Migliaccio et al . , 2012 ) , which may be relevant for lateralised limb usage ( Makin et al . , 2010 ) . The structural differences in the corticospinal tract , associated with increased representation of the intact hand in the deprived cortex , may shed new light on the origin of bimanual plasticity in amputees , which has previously been regarded as a consequence of reduced inter-hemispheric inhibition ( Simões et al . , 2012 ) . Indeed , we find similar results in the deprived cerebellum , as identified in the sensorimotor cortex , despite fundamental differences in body-part topography ( Shambes et al . , 1978 ) in these two brain regions . One tentative interpretation of these findings is that longer-range plasticity ( where the deprived cortex is recruited by the intact hand ) elicits structural white matter change , whereas more local plasticity ( where the deprived cortex is recruited by the residual arm ) does not . However , the cross-sectional nature of the study does not allow us to differentiate between experience-dependent and pre-existing variations in white matter structure that might confer a bias towards intact hand representation in the deprived cortex . To conclude , we demonstrate how adaptive limb usage strategies may serve as powerful drivers of both functional and structural plasticity in adults . We show that the deprived cortex in people with either congenital or acquired hand absence is employed by whichever part of the upper limb individuals are relatively over-using ( compared to other 1-handed individuals ) to compensate for their disability . This occurs irrespective of whether this is a hand or an arm and the degree to which it is typically represented in the deprived brain area . By demonstrating that adaptive plasticity in amputees transcends the boundaries thought to restrict reorganisation after sensory deprivation in the adult human brain , our results may inspire future research , aimed at utilising neurorehabilitation to improve usage of both residual and intact arms , as well as artificial arms , in 1-handed individuals of all ages . 4 Materials and methods 18 individuals with sustained unilateral upper limb amputation ( mean age ± s . e . m = 46 ± 3 , 6 with absent right hand ) , 11 individuals with a congenital unilateral upper limb deficit ( age = 35 ± 4 , 3 with absent right hand ) and 22 intact controls ( age = 41 ± 3 , 7 left hand dominant ) were recruited for the study ( see Table 1 for demographic details ) . Recruitment was carried through the Oxford Centre for Enablement and Opcare in accordance with NHS national research ethics service approval . Informed consent and consent to publish was obtained in accordance with ethical standards set out by the Declaration of Helsinki ( 1964 ) and with procedures approved by the NHS ( REC ref: 10/H0707/29 ) . Data from one individual with acquired deprivation and one control were discarded , due to excessive head movements ( >3 mm ) during fMRI and problems during DTI data acquisition ( respectively ) . In order to assess potential differences in rehabilitation strategies between the two amputee groups , use of residual arm was initially assessed using a revised version of the Motor Activity Log ( Uswatte et al . , 2006 ) . 1-handed participants were requested to rate how frequently ( never; sometimes; very often ) they incorporate their residual arm ( stump; either directly , or using a prosthesis ) in an inventory of daily activities , requiring varying degrees of motor control . The following items were used: taking money out of wallet; opening envelope; picking up/lifting glasses; picking up/holding up a phone; wiping off a kitchen counter or other surface; getting out of a car; stabilizing paper while writing; stabilizing dishes while carrying; carrying a cup or a can; carrying bags; getting up from a chair with arm rests; pulling chair away from table before sitting down; holding a book or a magazine/turning pages; typing on a keyboard/pressing mouse buttons; controlling a computer mouse; putting on your socks; putting on your shoes; tying shoe laces; inserting your ( intact ) arm through a sleeve; putting on makeup base , lotion , or shaving cream on face; washing hand or face; drying your hand or face; combing your hair; buttoning a shirt; zipping up a coat; peeling fruit skin; using a fork or spoon for eating . As previous motor activity logs were designed to assess mobility of a paralyzed hand , the questionnaire was modified while considering the unique confounds of unilateral amputees ( Lindner et al . , 2010 ) , and was aimed to accommodate participants with various levels of deprivation . In accordance with the original questionnaire , the items represented commonly encountered actions and covered a comprehensive range of activities , to accommodate various levels of skill of the residual arm . We focused on frequency , rather than quality of movement rating , as we were interested in both prosthetic limb and stump usage , which could not have been easily assessed . We used a scale of three frequency ratings , rather than five , since pilot testing showed that individuals tended to ignore the second and fourth options . Each item was scored ( between 0 and 2 ) , and the sum was divided by 54 , such that individuals were rated on a scale between 0 to 1 . To validate the usage questionnaires , and to study the relationship between increased reported residual arm usage and intact hand usage , limb acceleration data were collected from a subset of 21 limb-absent individuals ( 8 with congenital absence ) using the GeneActiv accelerometers ( sample rate: 100 Hz ) . Participants were given two strapped sensors , which they were asked to place on their wrist ( intact hand ) or the proximal aspect of the upper arm ( residual arm ) during 2 days with a typical daily routine ( mean number of hours per day ± s . e . m . = 15:08 ± 37 min ) . Data from one acquired participant was discarded , due to hardware malfunction . Data for each of the three movement axes was initially smoothed using a 500 ms kernel , to discard high frequency noise . To quantify the number of movements executed with each limb , the difference between maximal and minimal acceleration values were initially calculated within a sliding window of 400 ms for each movement axis separately . In each time window , movements were identified as difference in acceleration that was above a threshold of 0 . 2 m/s2 in at least one axis , provided that this increase was preceded and followed by periods of no movement ( a difference between maximal and minimal acceleration below 0 . 2 m/s2 ) in all axes . To account for whole body movements , as well as differences in number of hours of recordings , a ratio between the two limb movements was used , rather than an absolute number of movements . The movement laterality ratio was chosen [ ( intact−residual ) / ( intact+residual ) ] , as it portrays the extent of intact hand usage , given the contribution of residual arm movements . Task-based fMRI: participants were visually instructed to move their left/right hand ( finger movements ) , left/right arm ( elbow movements ) , feet ( bilateral toe movements ) or lips . The protocol comprised of alternating 12 s periods of movement and ‘rest’ . Each of the six conditions was repeated four times , in a counterbalanced order . Here we focus on results from intact/dominant hand and residual/nondominant elbow movements ( see Makin et al . , 2013 ) for information about phantom movements ) . Participants received extensive training on the degree and form of movements expected . Note that the movements were easy to execute and did not require any expertise . To confirm that appropriate movements were made at the instructed times , task performance was monitored visually both on- and off-line , using video recordings . The MRI measurements were obtained using a 3 Tesla Verio scanner ( Siemens , Erlangen , Germany ) with a 32-channel head coil . Anatomical data were acquired using a T1-weighted magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo sequence ( MPRAGE ) with the parameters: TR = 2040 ms; TE = 4 . 7 ms; flip angle = 8° , voxel size = 1 mm isotropic resolution . Functional data based on the blood oxygenation level-dependent ( BOLD ) signal were acquired using a multiple gradient echo-planar T2*-weighted pulse sequence , with the parameters: TR = 2000 ms; TE = 30 ms; flip angle = 90°; imaging matrix = 64 × 64; FOV = 192 mm axial slices . 46 slices with slice thickness of 3 mm and no gap were oriented in the oblique axial plane , covering the whole cortex , with partial coverage of the cerebellum . Two sets of whole brain diffusion weighted volumes were acquired using a generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisitions ( GRAPPA ) sequence , using the following parameters: 60 directions ( plus 8 vol without diffusion weighting ) ; b = 1000 s/mm; 65 axial slices; voxel size 2 × 2 × 2 mm; TR = 9600 ms; TE = 87 ms . All imaging data were processed using FSL 5 . 1 ( www . fmrib . ox . ac . uk/fsl ) . Data collected for individuals with absent right hands ( 6 acquired and 3 congenital participants ) , were mirror reversed across the mid-sagittal plane prior to all analyses so that the hemisphere corresponding to the missing hand was consistently aligned . Data collected for left-hand dominant controls ( n = 7 ) were also flipped , in order to account for potential biases stemming from this procedure . Functional data were analysed using FMRIB’s expert analysis tool ( FEAT , version 5 . 98 ) . The following pre-statistics processing was applied to each individual run: motion correction using FMRIB’s Linear Image Registration Tool ( MCFLIRT [Jenkinson et al . , 2002] ) ; brain-extraction using BET ( Smith , 2002 ) ; mean-based intensity normalization; high pass temporal filtering of 300 s; and spatial smoothing using a Gaussian kernel of FWHM ( full width at half maximum ) 5 mm . Time-series statistical analysis was carried out using FILM ( FMRIB’s Improved Linear Model ) with local autocorrelation correction . Functional data were aligned to structural images ( within-subject ) initially using linear registration ( FMRIB’s Linear Image Registration Tool , FLIRT ) , then optimized using Boundary-Based Registration ( Greve and Fischl , 2009 ) . Structural images were transformed to standard MNI space using a non-linear registration tool ( FNIRT ) , and the resulting warp fields applied to the functional statistical summary images . To compute task-based statistical parametric maps , we applied a voxel-based general linear model ( GLM ) , as implemented in FEAT . The block design paradigm was convolved with a gamma function ( Friston et al . , 1998 ) , and its temporal derivative was used to model the activation time-course at the individual level . For our main comparisons , contrasts between the intact/dominant hand and the residual/nondominant arm conditions were defined against the feet condition . Further contrasts were defined between intact/dominant arm ( in the congenital group ) and nondominant/missing hand ( in the acquired group ) vs feet movements . Group level analysis of spatial maps was carried out using FMRIB’s Local Analysis of Mixed Effects ( FLAME ) . Intact hand movements in the 1-handed groups was compared with dominant hand movements in controls , and residual arm movements were compared with non-dominant arm movements . Data from participants with above elbow deprivation ( 1 congenital and 7 acquired participants ) were excluded from the analysis of activity during arm movements . The cross-subject GLM included planned comparisons between each of the groups against the other two , while accounting for the unbalanced comparison . Z ( Gaussianised T/F ) statistic images were thresholded using clusters determined by Z>2 and a family-wise-error corrected cluster significance threshold of p<0 . 05 was applied to the suprathreshold clusters . To visualise the human homunculus , activation maps during feet , hands , arms and lip movements in the control group were thresholded at Z>3 , each map was mirror flipped and maps representing each of the four body parts were averaged , such that a symmetrical representation of each body part was achieved . For presentation purposes , statistical parametric activation maps were projected on the inflated surface of a representative participant’s cortex , using FreeSurfer . We followed the same ROI selection and thresholding procedures as previously reported in Makin et al . ( 2013 ) . Briefly , it has been demonstrated that movements of a phantom limb elicit both central and peripheral motor signals that are different from those found during imagined movement ( Reilly et al . , 2006; Raffin et al . , 2012 ) . Since the acquired , but not the congenital participants , displayed group activation in the sensorimotor hand knob during phantom hand movements ( Makin et al . , 2013 ) , the congenital group was excluded from the ROI definition . The ‘deprived cortex’ ROI was therefore defined using the conjunction of missing/non-dominant hand movements ( compared to feet movements ) in the acquired and control groups only . A pre-determined threshold of Z>7 was chosen , yielding a single cluster , centred on the hand knob of the central sulcus , contralateral to the missing hand . A second cluster in lobule V of the cerebellum , ipsilateral to the nondominant/phantom hand was defined separately . For within-participant comparisons , a homologous ROI for the intact hand was defined using the conjunction between controls and all 1-handed participants ( using a pre-determined threshold of Z>8 ) , yielding a comparable cluster contralateral to the intact hand . GLM parameter estimate values ( β ) of the low level statistical parametric maps of the contrasts described above were extracted from all voxels underlying the pre-determined ROIs and then averaged for each participant . Voxelwise statistical analysis of the FA data were carried out using Tract-Based Spatial Statistics ( TBSS [Smith et al . , 2006] ) . TBSS projects all subjects’ FA data onto a mean FA tract skeleton , before applying voxelwise cross-subject statistics . Diffusion data were initially corrected for eddy-currents and head motion using affine registration to the average of the non-diffusion-weighted volumes . A diffusion tensor model was fitted at every voxel to derive FA maps , which were non-linearly registered to group-specific templates created from 11 participants of each group ( FA thresholds > 0 . 2 ) . The resulting FA images were temporally concatenated into a single 4D file and averaged to create a mean ‘skeleton’ , representing the centre of all white matter tracts onto which participant-specific FA values were projected . Tract-based spatial statistics was performed voxel-wise , using a GLM and permutation-based non-parametric testing . The GLM included either planned comparisons between the three groups , or the beta values extracted from the deprived cortex ROI during intact hand movements for each of the individuals with hand absence . An age regressor of no interest was also included for the correlation analysis . Clusters were formed at t > 2 and tested for significance at p<0 . 05 , corrected for multiple comparisons across space . For presentation purposes , the FA clusters were dilated to fill the corresponding tracts . For analysis of limb-use data , independent-samples two-tailed t-tests were used to compare congenital and acquired groups . For ROI-based analysis of fMRI activation , intact hand movements in the 1-handed groups was compared with dominant hand movements in controls , and residual arm movements were compared with non-dominant arm movements . Data from participants with above elbow deprivation were excluded from the analysis of activity during arm movements . Between-group effects were initially statistically compared using a mixed-level ANOVA . For each limb , two comparisons were planned based on our behavioural results . Therefore , for follow-up unpaired t-tests of these planned comparisons , a p-value of p≤0 . 025 was used , to account for multiple comparisons . Other within/between-group effects were statistically compared using paired/independent-samples two-tailed t-tests ( α < 0 . 05 ) . Where significant departure from normality was found ( based on the Shapiro-Wilk test ) , nonparametric tests were used ( Man-Whitney or Wilcoxon , as appropriate ) . To test for correlations between questionnaire , acceleration data , and fMRI activation , two-tailed Pearson tests were used . To exclude the involvement of various confounds from the correlation analysis ( e . g . , level of amputation , age at deprivation ) , post-hoc one-tailed partial correlation analysis was performed . To exclude the involvement of various confounds ( e . g . , phantom pain ) from the group comparisons , univariate GLM comparisons were carried , with the confounding measurement as a covariate . To account for the potential contribution of phantom pain on the BOLD differences , chronic levels of phantom pain were assessed in each 1-handed individual . Chronic pain magnitude was calculated by dividing pain intensity ( 0: ‘no pain’—10: ‘worst pain imaginable’ ) by frequency ( 1—‘all the time’ , 2 —‘daily’ , 3—‘weekly’ , 4—‘several times per month’ and 5—‘once or less per month’ ) . This measure therefore reflects the chronic aspect of the pain as it combines both frequency and intensity , as used previously ( Draganski et al . , 2006; Makin et al . , 2013 ) . Comparison between correlations was assessed using a two-tailed Fisher r-to-z transformation . Statistical analysis was carried with SPSS version 18 ."}

Split right down the middle , and the two daughter cells will be identical; offset the cleavage plane to one side , and the resulting siblings will have different sizes , places and fates . In animals , the splitting of cells is dictated by the location of the spindle , a structure that forms when cable-like microtubules stretch from the cell membrane to attach to the chromosomes . At the membrane , a group of proteins tugs on the microtubules to bring the spindle into the correct position . One of these proteins , dynein , is a motor that uses microtubules as its track to pull the spindle into place . What the other parts of the complex do is still unclear , but a general assumption is that they may be serving as an anchor for dynein . To test this model , Fielmich , Schmidt et al . removed one or more proteins from the complex in the developing embryos of the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans . A light-activated system then linked the remaining proteins to the membrane by tying them to an artificial anchor . Two of the proteins in the complex could be replaced with the artificial anchor , but pulling forces were absent when dynein was artificially tied to the membrane . This indicates that the motor being anchored at the edge of the cell is not enough for it to pull on microtubules . Instead , the experiments showed that dynein needs to be activated by another component of the complex , a protein called LIN-5 . This suggests that individual proteins in the complex have specialized roles that go beyond simply tethering dynein . In fact , steering where LIN-5 was attached on the membrane helped to control the location of the spindle , and therefore of the cleavage plane . As mammals have a protein similar to LIN-5 , dissecting the roles of the components involved in positioning the spindle in C . elegans could help to understand normal and abnormal human development . In addition , these results demonstrate that creating artificial interactions between proteins using light is a powerful technique to study biological processes .", "article": "1 Introduction Animal cells control the position of the spindle to determine the plane of cell cleavage . Regulated spindle positioning is therefore critical for asymmetric cell division and tissue formation ( di Pietro et al . , 2016 ) . Early work in C . elegans demonstrated that cortical pulling forces position the spindle through a protein complex that consists of a heterotrimeric G protein alpha subunit , GOA-1Gαo or GPA-16Gαi ( together referred to as Gα ) , a TPR-GoLoco domain protein GPR-1/2 , and the coiled-coil protein LIN-5 ( Colombo et al . , 2003; Gotta and Ahringer , 2001; Gotta et al . , 2003; Grill et al . , 2001; Lorson et al . , 2000; Miller and Rand , 2000; Srinivasan et al . , 2003 ) . This complex , and the closely related Drosophila Gαi/o–Pins–Mud and mammalian Gαi/o–LGN–NuMA protein complexes , recruit the microtubule motor dynein to the cell cortex ( Bellaïche et al . , 2001; Bowman et al . , 2006; Du and Macara , 2004; Du et al . , 2001; Izumi et al . , 2004; Nguyen-Ngoc et al . , 2007; Schaefer et al . , 2001; Zheng et al . , 2010; Zhu et al . , 2011 ) ( Figure 1a ) . While regulation at the level of individual components has been described , it remains unclear whether these proteins only form a physical anchor for dynein , or whether individual subunits contribute additional functions in spindle positioning . As a potential additional function , force generation may require a dynein adaptor that activates dynein motility . Such an adaptor is necessary for the processive movement of mammalian cytoplasmic dynein during cargo transport along microtubules ( Reck-Peterson et al . , 2018 ) . This process differs substantially from microtubule-dependent cortical pulling , in which force is generated by dynein in association with shrinking microtubules ( Laan et al . , 2012 ) . Without adaptor , surface-anchored yeast dynein in contact with depolymerizing microtubules generates pulling forces in vitro ( Laan et al . , 2012 ) . However , yeast dynein moves processively on its own ( Reck-Peterson et al . , 2006 ) . Hence , it remains unknown whether cortical pulling force generation in animal cells depends just on anchoring of dynein , or whether this requires an additional dynein activator . The role of Gαi/o subunits in pulling force generation has also remained ambiguous ( Figure 1a ) . Membrane-attached Gα∙GDP associates with GoLoco motifs present in the homologous GPR-1/2 , Pins , and LGN proteins ( Kimple et al . , 2002; Schaefer et al . , 2001 ) . This preference for the GDP-bound ‘inactive’ Gα state explains why RGS-7 , a putative GTPase activating protein ( GAP ) , promotes spindle positioning ( Hess et al . , 2004 ) . However , the role of another conserved regulator of Gα signaling , RIC-8 , remains poorly understood ( Afshar et al . , 2004; Miller and Rand , 2000; Tall et al . , 2003 ) . RIC-8 was shown to act as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor ( GEF ) in vitro , while it may function in vivo as a Gα chaperone or as both a GEF and chaperone ( Afshar et al . , 2004; Afshar et al . , 2005; David et al . , 2005; Gabay et al . , 2011; Hampoelz et al . , 2005; Tall et al . , 2003; Wang et al . , 2005 ) . In addition to RIC-8 , G-protein coupled receptors and Gαo∙GTP signaling contribute to spindle positioning in Drosophila neuroblasts and sensory organ precursor cells ( Katanaev et al . , 2005; Schaefer et al . , 2001; Yoshiura et al . , 2012 ) . Therefore , it has been proposed that the Gα∙GTP-binding and hydrolysis cycle forms a critical step in cortical pulling force generation ( Afshar et al . , 2004; Srinivasan et al . , 2003; Yoshiura et al . , 2012 ) . However , it is difficult to distinguish whether Gαo∙GTP contributes to force generation , or more indirectly relays cell-cell signaling to the spindle . Here , we describe an optogenetic strategy for the systematic examination of individual contributions of cortical pulling force components in vivo . We use the C . elegans one-cell embryo ( P0 ) , which undergoes reproducible spindle positioning and asymmetric cell division in the absence of cell-cell signaling ( Video 1 ) ( Rose and Gonczy , 2014 ) . As an initial hurdle , modifying endogenous genes with tunable light-controlled interacting protein tags ( TULIPs ) induced strong germline silencing . We developed a strategy to promote expression of foreign sequences in the C . elegans germline , which is based in part on a new codon usage adaptation method ( GLO , GermLine Optimized ) . This allowed the light-controlled localization of endogenous proteins through ePDZ–LOV domain interactions in the early C . elegans embryo . Our results show that Gα∙GDP and GPR-1/2 can be replaced with a light-inducible membrane anchor , while LIN-5 is required as activator of dynein-dependent cortical pulling force generation . Local light-controlled LIN-5 recruitment enabled us to manipulate the spindle position and orientation , and thereby the outcome of cell division in the early embryo . 2 Results We set out to systematically investigate the individual roles of the proteins involved in cortical pulling force generation . Our previous studies and CRISPR/Cas9-assisted endogenous tagging demonstrated that cytoplasmic dynein and the Gα–GPR-1/2–LIN-5 complex overlap and function together in pulling force generation at the cell cortex of C . elegans early blastomeres ( Figure 1b ) ( Portegijs et al . , 2016; Schmidt et al . , 2017; van der Voet et al . , 2009 ) . As a read-out for pulling forces , we measured spindle pole peak velocities after UV-laser ablation of the spindle midzone ( Grill et al . , 2001 ) ( Figure 1c and Video 2 ) . Interfering with Gα , GPR-1/2 , or LIN-5 function abolished significant force generation , as previously reported ( Figure 1d ) . RNA interference ( RNAi ) of ric-8 or rgs-7 by dsRNA injection resulted in partial loss of pulling forces ( Figure 1e ) . Double ric-8 ( RNAi ) ; rgs-7 ( RNAi ) did not further decrease pulling forces as might be expected when RIC-8 and RGS-7 both promote a critical GTPase cycle ( Hess et al . , 2004; Srinivasan et al . , 2003 ) . However , RNAi of ric-8 and rgs-7 is known to cause incomplete gene inactivation , which could also explain the limited defects . To circumvent this caveat , we set out to generate germline-inducible knock-out alleles , as ric-8 and rgs-7 null mutants produce no or very few viable progeny ( Hess et al . , 2004; Reynolds et al . , 2005 ) . To this end , we inserted lox sites in the endogenous ric-8 and rgs-7 loci by CRISPR/Cas9-assisted recombineering ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) , and expressed the CRE recombinase specifically in the germline ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . Compared to the control without CRE activity , knockout embryos showed reduced spindle pole peak velocities ( ric-8lox: anterior −50% and posterior −48%; rgs-7lox: anterior −29% and posterior −11% ) , similar to or more defective than the corresponding RNAi embryos ( Figure 1e and Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ) . Importantly , the double knock-out of ric-8lox; rgs-7lox showed much reduced spindle pole movements ( anterior −68% and posterior −67% ) , thereby resembling Gα ( RNAi ) ( Figure 1e ) . This indicates that RIC-8 and RGS-7 act independently , or partly redundant , as positive regulators of Gα . To gain further insight into the individual functions of cortical pulling force regulators , we sought to obtain spatiotemporal control of protein localization . To this end , we explored implementing the ePDZ–LOV system , which makes use of exposure to blue light to control protein heterodimerization ( Harterink et al . , 2016; Strickland et al . , 2012 ) . As introduction of epdz , lov , and cre sequences induced strong germline silencing responses , we developed a computational approach to design protein-coding sequences that are resistant to silencing in the germline . Our design algorithm assembles a coding sequence for any desired polypeptide from a list of 12-nucleotide words found in native germline-expressed genes ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) . We hypothesized that transgenes designed in this way would mimic native genes and thereby evade the germline silencing machinery . Indeed , using this approach , we could obtain robust expression of several foreign transgenes that were otherwise silenced ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2 ) . Although most of these transgenes were stably expressed for many generations , two out of 16 distinct constructs tested showed evidence of gradual silencing when passaging strains in culture ( Figure 2—figure supplement 3 ) . Therefore , as a further buffer against silencing , we combined our germline-optimized exons with poly-AT-cluster rich intron sequences , which were recently demonstrated to protect against germline silencing ( Frøkjær-Jensen et al . , 2016; Zhang et al . , 2018 ) . This combined approach resulted in stable germline expression of eight out of eight transgenes and enabled implementation of the ePDZ–LOV system for use in the C . elegans early embryo . To characterize the ePDZ–LOV system , we created a strain with a membrane-bound LOV2 domain , expressed as a pleckstrin-homology domain ( PH ) –eGFP protein fusion ( PH::LOV ) , together with cytosolic ePDZ::mCherry ( Figure 2a ) . Illumination with a blue ( 491 nm ) laser rapidly induced recruitment of ePDZ::mCherry to PH::LOV , and allowed both global and local cortical enrichment in one-cell embryos ( Figure 2b and Videos 3–5 ) . Because GFP is also excited with blue light , experiments that involve GFP imaging imply global and continuous induction of the ePDZ–LOV interaction . To test the reversibility of the ePDZ–LOV interaction , we followed ePDZ::mCherry membrane localization after a global activation pulse , and found dissociation kinetics similar to those reported by others ( Hallett et al . , 2016 ) ( t½=42 s; Figure 2c and Video 6 ) . Thus , we conclude that the ePDZ–LOV system is suitable for controlled protein localization in the early C . elegans embryo . Next , we examined whether membrane recruitment of RGS-7 and RIC-8 promotes pulling forces . This could provide insight into the in vivo relevance of the Gα∙GDP/GTP cycle and indicate whether RIC-8 is more likely to contribute as a chaperone or as a GEF . Regulation of the Gα∙GDP/GTP cycle normally takes place at the cell membrane , while chaperoning of Gα folding and trafficking is expected to occur in the cytosol and at endomembranes ( Gabay et al . , 2011 ) . We created strains expressing endogenous RIC-8 and RGS-7 as ePDZ::mCherry protein fusions . When combined with PH::LOV , this resulted in light-inducible membrane recruitment of RIC-8 and RGS-7 ( Figures 3a and 4a , and Video 7 ) . Global cortical enrichment of RGS-7 enhanced spindle pole movements ( anterior +25% and posterior +20% ) ( Figure 3b ) and spindle oscillations ( Figure 3c ) . The RGS-7::ePDZ signal was too subtle to reliably control its local recruitment . As an alternative strategy , we fused eGFP::LOV to endogenous PAR-6 , which localizes to the anterior cortex of the zygote ( Figure 3a ) . Following global light exposure , recruitment of RGS-7::ePDZ to PAR-6::LOV enhanced the peak velocities of both spindle poles , but most significantly the movement of the anterior pole ( anterior +25% and posterior +14%; Figure 3b , c ) . Thus , cortical recruitment of RGS-7 acutely increases pulling forces , in agreement with its proposed function as a GAP that promotes Gα∙GDP–GPR-1/2 interaction . In contrast , cortical enrichment of RIC-8 did not significantly enhance pulling forces ( Figure 4b ) . Thus , in agreement with the ric-8lox; rgs-7lox synergistic phenotype , our optogenetic localization experiments support a model in which RIC-8 and RGS-7 promote Gα function at different levels . While RGS-7 probably functions as a GAP , our data are in line with RIC-8 acting in vivo as a Gα chaperone , rather than a GEF , thus indirectly promoting force generation . To directly address whether Gα∙GTP might contribute to spindle positioning and if Gα∙GDP serves merely as a membrane anchor , we aimed to reconstruct a cortical force generator in the absence of Gα ( Figure 5a ) . We obtained optogenetic control over the membrane localization of GPR-1 by combining endogenously labeled epdz::mcherry::gpr-1 ( ePDZ::GPR-1 ) with knockout of gpr-2 , expression of PH::LOV and Gα RNAi ( Figure 5b , c and Videos 8 and 9 ) . Live imaging and immunohistochemistry confirmed light-induced cortical recruitment of ePDZ::GPR-1 and consequently LIN-5 ( Figure 5b and Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) . Spindle movements appeared reduced following the tagging of gpr-1 and knockout of gpr-2 ( anterior −40% and posterior −26% ) ( Figure 5—figure supplement 2 ) . However , light-induced ePDZ::GPR-1 recruitment increased spindle pole movements ( anterior +56% and posterior +10% ) ( Figure 5d , f ) . Moreover , membrane-localized ePDZ::GPR-1 sustained force generation in the absence of Gα ( anterior +195% and posterior +232% ) , indicating that Gα is dispensable for cortical pulling force generation . Recruitment of ePDZ::GPR-1 restored spindle pole movements to a similar degree in Gα ( RNAi ) and Gα ( RNAi ) ; ric-8 ( RNAi ) embryos ( Figure 5d ) . Thus , cortical pulling forces can be generated when the Gα membrane anchor function is replaced by PH::LOV , and most likely in the absence of Gαi/o∙GTP . We conclude that Gα functions as a membrane anchor and that Gα∙GTP does not perform an essential function in pulling force generation . Light-controlled heterodimerization exhibits a certain level of dark state activity ( Hallett et al . , 2016 ) . We performed spindle severing experiments in the absence of blue light to confirm the light-specificity of recruitment . Replacement of gfp::tubulin with an mcherry::tubulin transgene allowed for tracking of the spindle in the absence of blue light and consequently LOV activation . We observed that the scattering of UV-light ( 355 nm ) during midzone ablation also uncages the LOV domain . Nevertheless , the presence of blue light resulted in substantially elevated spindle pulling forces when compared to dark state experiments ( anterior +33% and posterior +35% ) ( Figure 5e ) . We conclude that the observed spindle pole movements are light-dependent and the specific result of inducible cortical recruitment of GPR-1 . Considering that spindle poles moved in three dimensions after recruitment of GPR-1 , measuring peak velocities after midzone severing by tracking the poles in two dimensions likely underestimates the resulting pulling forces . Therefore , we used an additional read-out of cortical pulling forces . Cortical pulling events cause inward movements of the plasma membrane , which are visible by spinning disk-confocal fluorescence microscopy as extended invaginations of the plasma membrane ( Redemann et al . , 2010 ) ( Figure 5g and Videos 10 and 11 ) . These membrane invaginations occur in wild type embryos , depend on microtubules and cortical force generator components , and correlate with the distribution of pulling force generators ( Redemann et al . , 2010 ) . Therefore , these membrane invaginations most likely reveal the presence and distribution of active individual force generators . Using spinning disk confocal microscopy , we quantified membrane invaginations by counting the number of transient cortical PH::GFP dots in the sub-cortical plane . Control PH::GFP embryos showed on average 138 membrane invaginations during anaphase in an area covering approximately 1/3 of the cell surface ( Figure 5g ) . When plotted along the anterior-posterior axis , the distribution of these invaginations reflected the three described cortical domains: anterior , posterior , and a posterior lateral region at ±60% embryo length ( Rose and Gonczy , 2014 ) ( Figure 5h-left ) . The posterior lateral band region localizes the LET-99 DEP-domain protein , which antagonizes the localization of GPR-1/2 and thereby pulling force generation ( Krueger et al . , 2010; Tsou et al . , 2003 ) . This explains the absence of invaginations around 60% embryo length ( Figure 5h-left ) . Cortical GPR-1 recruitment resulted in a total number of 174 ( +25% compared to ph::lov control ) invaginations in the presence , and 122 invaginations ( +249% compared to Gα ( RNAi ) embryos ) in the absence of Gα ( Figure 5 and Figure 5—figure supplement 3 ) . Thus , in agreement with our observations in spindle severing assays , GPR-1 recruitment to the membrane induces cortical pulling forces , even in the apparent absence of Gα proteins . The lack of invaginations around 60% embryo length was no longer detected when ePDZ::GPR-1 was recruited to PH::LOV . In agreement , the characteristic dip in cortical GPR-1 localization ( e . g . : Figure 1b ) was no longer detected after ectopic GPR-1 recruitment ( Figure 5b ) . Thus , as expected , LET-99 does not antagonize the cortical recruitment of ePDZ::GPR-1 by PH::LOV , in contrast to the Gα∙GDP-mediated localization of endogenous GPR-1/2 . The pattern of invaginations still showed two peaks and a mild dip at 50% embryo length ( Figure 5h ) . The remaining peak numbers of invaginations likely represent the cortical regions closest to the spindle poles , as these sites contact the highest numbers of astral microtubules . Taken together , Gα is not essential for force generation , but the characteristic distribution of force generating events is likely regulated in part at the Gα protein or Gα–GPR-1/2 protein interaction level . The Gα–GPR-1/2–LIN-5 complex has been suggested to function as a dynein anchor ( Kotak et al . , 2012; di Pietro et al . , 2016 ) . Our optogenetic approach allows replacing the entire complex by PH::LOV , and examining whether the complex strictly acts as an anchor , or whether individual components have additional functions ( Figure 6a ) . To directly recruit dynein to the cortex , we generated an epdz::mcherry knock-in allele of dhc-1 ( dynein heavy chain ) . While homozygous epdz::mcherry::dhc-1 ( ePDZ::DHC-1 ) was viable , its combination with ph::egfp::lov was lethal . This effect was also observed for an ePDZ::GFP fusion of DHC-1 in the presence of PH::LOV , but not in the absence of PH::LOV or for mCherry::DHC-1 without the ePDZ domain . Therefore , we attributed the lethality to ePDZ–LOV dark state interactions that disturb essential dynein functions . We circumvented this effect by using epdz::mcherry::dhc-1 in combination with a wild-type allele ( epdz::mcherry::dhc-1/+ ) to control dynein localization links to different figure ( Figure 6b , c and Videos 12 and 13 ) . We found that induced ePDZ::DHC-1 cortical recruitment in the presence of the wild type complex slightly ( but not significantly ) increased spindle pole movements ( anterior +10% and posterior +5% , 162 membrane invaginations:+17%; Figure 6d–f ) . In addition , cortical recruitment of ePDZ::DHC-1 slightly increased the nearly absent spindle pole movements in lin-5 ( RNAi ) embryos ( Figure 6—figure supplement 2 ) . Notably , however , cortical ePDZ::DHC-1 recruitment in the absence of a wild type complex ( Gα ( RNAi ) , gpr-1/2 ( RNAi ) or lin-5 ( RNAi ) embryos ) did not result in substantial pulling force generation , spindle movements , or membrane invaginations ( Figure 6d–f and Figure 6—figure supplement 1 ) . Because direct cortical dynein anchoring does not support force generation , it is likely that the LIN-5 complex performs essential functions beyond providing a structural dynein anchor . In vitro reconstitution studies established that homodimerizing adapters containing extended coiled-coil domains are critical for dynein activity ( McKenney et al . , 2014; Schlager et al . , 2014 ) . LIN-5 and its homologs NuMA and Mud are predicted to contain a long coiled-coil domain , to homodimerize , and to interact with dynein ( Kotak et al . , 2012; Lorson et al . , 2000; Merdes et al . , 1996 ) . To investigate if LIN-5 can activate dynein-dependent force generation , we recruited endogenous LIN-5 to the cortex ( Figure 7a–c and Videos 14 and 15 ) . Spindle severing experiments and invagination counting revealed that cortical LIN-5 recruitment greatly increased spindle pulling forces in otherwise wild type embryos ( anterior +131% and posterior +68% , 557 invaginations:+303% ) ( Figure 7d , e and Figure 7—figure supplement 1 ) . gpr-1/2 ( RNAi ) embryos also showed strong dynein-dependent forces after cortical recruitment of LIN-5 ( anterior +183% and posterior +244% , 429 invaginations:+1488% ) . In fact , cortical LIN-5 recruitment generated extreme premature pulling forces ( Video 16 ) that could result in separation of centrosomes and their associated pronuclei even before formation of a bipolar spindle ( Video 17 ) . Therefore , embryos were kept in the absence of blue light until mitotic metaphase . Subsequent blue light exposure induced cortical LIN-5 recruitment within seconds , and the spindles showed excessive movements in all three dimensions well before cortical LIN-5 reached peak levels ( Figure 7c , e , Videos 14 and 15 ) . Therefore , the number of membrane invaginations in anaphase probably reflects the pulling forces more accurately than the average peak velocities of the poles ( Figure 7f and Figure 7—figure supplement 1 ) . These results identify LIN-5 as a strong activator of dynein in the generation of cortical pulling forces . We observed similarly high pulling forces upon cortical LIN-5 recruitment in gpr-1/2 ( RNAi ) and Gα ( RNAi ) embryos ( Figure 7—figure supplement 1 ) . Thus , neither Gα nor GPR-1/2 are required for force generation , and this particular context did not reveal a positive contribution of Gα∙GTP either . In immunofluorescence staining experiments , we observed that cortical recruitment of LIN-5 localized dynein to the cortex ( Figure 7—figure supplement 2 ) . Notably , the reverse was also seen: we detected LIN-5 at the cortex following the direct recruitment of ePDZ::DHC-1 to PH::LOV , even after knockdown of gpr-1/2 by RNAi ( Figure 6—figure supplement 2 , top ) . The p150 ( Glued ) dynactin subunit DNC-1 was also present at the cell cortex of such embryos , which indicates that at least some PH::LOV-localized dynein complexes contain the dynactin cofactor ( Figure 6—figure supplement 2 , lower panels ) . DNC-1p150 colocalized with PH::LOV membrane-recruited dynein even in lin-5 ( RNAi ) embryos . Thus , the cortical localization of dynein through a direct PH::LOV interaction leads to co-recruitment of LIN-5 and dynactin , but not to significant force generation . It is possible that these complexes adapt an inactive conformation or lack specific subunits of the dynein-dynactin motor complex . In contrast , dynein anchored at the cell cortex through the LIN-5 intermediate generated strong pulling forces . Together , these data indicate that association with membrane-attached LIN-5 is essential for dynein to generate cortical pulling forces . Next , we examined whether we could deploy cortical LIN-5 to manipulate spindle positioning and the outcome of cell division by local illumination with blue light . In the normal P0 cell , the spindle is displaced towards the posterior and cell cleavage creates a larger anterior blastomere ( AB ) and a smaller posterior blastomere ( P1 ) . Local recruitment of LIN-5 to the anterior cortex from metaphase onwards caused the P0 spindle to position anteriorly , which inverted the AB:P1 size asymmetry after cell division ( Figure 8a and Video 18 ) . In addition , recruiting LIN-5 laterally induced a completely perpendicular spindle position ( Figure 8b and Video 19 ) . While this triggered some furrowing at the anterior and posterior cell poles , the spindle switched back to an anterior-posterior orientation during cytokinesis , possibly resulting from geometric constraints . We therefore switched to two-cell embryos with the relatively round AB and P1 blastomeres . In two-cell gpr-1/2 ( RNAi ) embryos , the spindle fails to rotate in P1 , resulting in a transverse spindle orientation in both blastomeres ( Srinivasan et al . , 2003 ) . Importantly , local recruitment of LIN-5 to the membranes between AB and P1 promoted anterior-posterior spindle orientations in both blastomeres of gpr-1/2 ( RNAi ) embryos ( Figure 8c and Videos 20 and 21 ) . These spindles maintained their anterior-posterior orientation throughout mitosis and induced cleavage furrows that reproducibly followed the spindle position . These experiments underline the determining role of LIN-5-dependent cortical pulling in spindle orientation and cell cleavage plane determination . 3 Discussion Recent advances in CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome engineering and optogenetics hold far-reaching potential for cell and developmental biology ( Johnson and Toettcher , 2018; Waaijers and Boxem , 2014 ) . We combined these strategies to systematically control the localization of endogenous proteins in the C . elegans early embryo by light-induced ePDZ–LOV heterodimerization , to determine their individual contributions in spindle positioning . This demonstrated that LIN-5 , but not Gα , RIC-8 and GPR-1/2 , is intrinsically required for dynein-dependent pulling force generation . Based on our quantitative analyses , we propose that Gα–GPR-1/2 provides a regulatable membrane anchor , while membrane-bound LIN-5 acts as an obligate adapter and activator of cytoplasmic dynein at the cell cortex . Our observations fit with and expand on those from studies in which the LIN-5-related Mud and NuMA proteins where tethered to the cortex . In two earlier studies , this resulted in the conclusion that the NuMA complex acts as a dynein anchor , but substitution of components or Gα protein removal was not tested ( Kotak et al . , 2012; Ségalen et al . , 2010 ) . However , a very recent study using human carcinoma cells followed an optogenetic strategy similar to ours , and also observed that a membrane anchor cannot replace the entire Gα–LGN–NuMA complex ( Okumura et al . , 2018 ) . As in C . elegans embryos , a CAAX membrane anchor could substitute for Gα–LGN in human carcinoma cells , while dynein needed to be anchored through NuMA in order to generate spindle positioning forces ( Okumura et al . , 2018 ) . Thus , observations in two different systems indicate that dynein activation at microtubule plus ends requires the LIN-5/NuMA adaptor protein , similar to the requirement for an activating dynein adaptor in cargo transport ( McKenney et al . , 2014; Schlager et al . , 2014; Zhang et al . , 2017 ) . It is tempting to speculate that activation by LIN-5NuMA specifically promotes dynein function in generating membrane associated pulling forces . In the cytoplasm , dynein adopts an inactive conformation and does not show processive movement in the absence of an activating adaptor ( Reck-Peterson et al . , 2018 ) . Adaptor proteins such as BicD2 and Hook3 interact with specific cargo as well as with the dynein tail regions and the universal activating complex dynactin ( McKenney et al . , 2014; Schlager et al . , 2014; Zhang et al . , 2017 ) . Thereby , these adaptors promote the formation of stable and active dynein–dynactin-adaptor complexes . Recent stuctural analyses revealed that the coiled-coil regions of the adaptors extend in between dynein and dynactin , with multiple adaptor-specific interaction sites , and with several adaptors promoting the recruitment of two dynein complexes in parallel ( Grotjahn et al . , 2018; Sladewski et al . , 2018; Urnavicius et al . , 2018 ) . Although structural studies have focused on factors promoting minus-end directed transport , it is likely that dynein-dependent cortical pulling forces also involve an activating adaptor . As such , LIN-5NuMA could promote the assembly of stable dynein–dynactin complexes and release dynein autoinhibition . It is remarkable , however , that direct recruitment of dynein to the cortex did not result in cortical pulling forces , despite the co-recruitment of LIN-5 and the dynactin subunit DNC-1p150 . At present , we do not know whether this reflects individual dynein–LIN-5 and dynein–dynactin interactions , or the formation of stable dynein–dynactin–LIN-5 complexes . The lack of pulling forces , despite co-recruitment of LIN-5NuMA and DNC-1p150 together with dynein , may indicate that the complex needs to be anchored through LIN-5 in order to achieve a specific conformation and facilitate microtubule end-on pulling forces . Such a requirement could prevent inappropriate activation of dynein–dynactin–LIN-5NuMA complexes in the cytoplasm . In the optogenetic experiments in human carcinoma cells , dynein also localized p150 at the membrane , however in contrast to our findings , NuMA was not observed to be co-recruited in this study ( Okumura et al . , 2018 ) . While the reason for this discrepancy is currently unknown , it might be related to the remarkably different kinetics of the two systems . Using the TULIP system , we observed membrane localization of ePDZ-tagged endogenous proteins within seconds , whereas in the iLID experiments in human carcinoma cells accumulation took place over multiple minutes . It is possible that in the longer time frame , cytoplasmic dynein complexes are recruited to the cortex with adaptors other than NuMA . Since only LIN-5 is strictly required for cortical pulling force generation , the question arises why a tripartite dynein anchor is conserved from worm to man . In yeast , dynein is localized by the single-component cortical anchor Num1 , a coiled-coil domain protein with a PH-domain for membrane localization ( Ananthanarayanan , 2016 ) . Our ectopic ePDZ–LOV heterodimerization experiments show that membrane-tethered LIN-5 could suffice as a dynein anchor and activator , and that local regulation is needed to rotate and displace the spindle . Conceivably , the trimeric dynein anchor/adaptor evolved in metazoans to augment context-specific regulation and reduce stochastic activation of spindle pulling forces . Which factors may normally control the Gα–GPR-1/2 membrane anchor ? The LET-99 protein was previously reported to restrict the localization of GPR-1/2 in a posterior-lateral band region of the one-cell embryo , thereby contributing to higher net pulling forces in the posterior direction ( Tsou et al . , 2002; Tsou et al . , 2003 ) . Our observation that direct membrane recruitment of GPR-1 overcomes this regulation is in agreement with LET-99 normally antagonizing Gα∙GDP–GPR-1/2 interaction . Another level of Gα–GPR-1/2 regulation that remains incompletely understood is the contribution of RIC-8 in spindle positioning . The ric-8 gene was discovered through ‘resistant to inhibitors of cholinesterase 8’ mutants in C . elegans , which are defective in Gαq-stimulated neurotransmitter release ( Miller et al . , 2000 ) . The discovery that ric-8 acts also with GOA-1 in spindle positioning indicated a general role for RIC-8 in Gα regulation ( Miller and Rand , 2000 ) . Indeed , two different general functions have been reported . Based on in vitro experiments , mammalian RIC-8A acts as a non-receptor GEF , which surprisingly does not activate Gαβγ trimers , but shows higher affinity for free Gα∙GDP and the Gα∙GDP–LGN–NuMA complex ( Tall and Gilman , 2005; Tall et al . , 2003 ) . In contrast , experiments in Drosophila and mouse embryonic stem cells demonstrated a chaperone function required for the cortical localization of Gα subunits ( David et al . , 2005; Gabay et al . , 2011; Hampoelz et al . , 2005; Wang et al . , 2005 ) . Only the Drosophila Gαi protein forms a complex with Pins–Mud ( Schaefer et al . , 2001 ) , and Drosophila Gαi , but not Gαo , depends on RIC-8 for its cortical localization ( David et al . , 2005 ) . Seemingly unifying these independently described RIC-8 functions , C . elegans RIC-8 was shown to exhibit both GEF and chaperone activity , depending on the Gα subunit ( Afshar et al . , 2004; Afshar et al . , 2005 ) . The C . elegans GOA-1 and GPA-16 Gα proteins act in a substantially redundant manner in spindle positioning , but diverge in other ways . GPA-16 is closest to the Gαi class , has been implicated only in spindle positioning , and depends on RIC-8 for its cortical localization ( Afshar et al . , 2005; Bergmann et al . , 2003; Gotta and Ahringer , 2001 ) . Thus , both C . elegans and Drosophila RIC-8 appears to act as a chaperone for Gαi to promote spindle positioning . Also similar to Drosophila , the Gαo GOA-1 subunit does not require RIC-8 for its membrane localization ( David et al . , 2005; Afshar et al . , 2005 ) . Instead , RIC-8 was reported to act as a GEF for GOA-1 ( Afshar et al . , 2004 ) , and is usually considered to act as a GEF for Gαq and Gαo in neurotransmitter release . However , the contribution of a Gαo GEF in spindle positioning would mean that either Gα∙GTP or Gα∙GDP/GTP cycling promotes spindle pulling forces . Both of these possibilities seem unlikely in light of the results described here . The fact that Gα can be replaced with a PH–membrane anchor dismisses a general requirement for Gα∙GTP in pulling force generation . Moreover , RIC-8 functioning in a Gα∙GDP/GTP cycle is not supported by our knockout and membrane localization studies . Therefore , there is reason to question whether RIC-8 really functions as a GEF . The strongest support for such a function has come from in vitro experiments , in which RIC-8 showed rather inefficient GEF activity towards Gα∙GDP ( Kant et al . , 2016; Thomas et al . , 2008 ) . It appears conceivable that incubation of Gα with a chaperone that affects its folding causes nucleotide dissociation . If correct , the membrane localized GOA-1 in ric-8 mutants would reflect an incompletely functional form . Despite the observed replaceability of Gα with a general membrane anchor , Gα∙GTP has been reported to affect the spindle orientation in specific tissues ( Katanaev et al . , 2005; Schaefer et al . , 2001; Yoshiura et al . , 2012 ) . In Drosophila neuroblasts and sensory organ precursor cells , canonical G-protein signaling is used to align cellular polarity with tissue polarity ( Katanaev et al . , 2005; Yoshiura et al . , 2012 ) . As such , Gα∙GTP may indirectly contribute to spindle positioning . In addition , one of the Drosophila Pins GoLoco domains was found to preferentially interact with Gαo∙GTP , thereby linking the spindle positioning machinery with canonical G-protein signaling ( Kopein and Katanaev , 2009; Yoshiura et al . , 2012 ) . Thus , while not needed for the generation of dynein-dependent cortical pulling forces , further studies will need to reveal to what extent Gα∙GTP contributes to spindle positioning in a tissue or developmental context specific manner . For our in vivo dissection of spindle positioning , we developed and applied methods for germline-specific gene knockout , tagging of endogenous proteins , reliable expression of foreign sequences in the germline , and light-inducible protein heterodimerization . These methods further expand the molecular biology toolbox for in vivo studies and can be broadly applied to other biological processes . Of particular interest is the acquired possibility to experimentally control the position of the spindle , for instance for future studies aimed at deciphering how the spindle determines the plane of cell cleavage , and whether specific cell-cell contacts affect cell fate . 4 Materials and methods The names and associated genotypes of C . elegans strains used in this study are included in Supplementary file 1 . Animals were maintained at either 15 or 20˚C as described previously ( Brenner , 1974 ) . Strains expressing both ePDZ and LOV protein motifs were regarded as light-sensitive and thus cultured in the dark , and transferred while using red light only . Animals were kept on plates that contained nematode growth medium ( NGM ) that had been seeded with OP50 Escherichia coli bacteria . DNA vector-based repair templates to be used for CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing were designed in A plasmid Editor ( M . Wayne Davis ) to include 500–1500 bp homology arms . These and all other sequences used were generated starting from either purified C . elegans genomic DNA or pre-existing vectors via PCR amplification using Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase ( New England Biolabs ) . A list of all cloning , repair template and genotyping primers ( Integrated DNA technologies ) and DNA templates used has been included in Supplementary file 2 . PCR fragments were gel purified ( Qiagen ) , their concentrations measured using a BioPhotometer D30 ( Eppendorf ) and then ligated into pBSK by Gibson assembly ( New England Biolabs ) . gRNA vectors were generated by annealing of antisense oligonucleotide pairs and subsequent ligation into BbsI-linearized pJJR50 or BsaI-linearized pMB70 using T4 ligase ( New England Biolabs ) . All DNA vectors used for genome editing were transformed into DH5α competent cells and subsequently purified by midiprep ( Qiagen ) . Custom Perl scripts were written to design germline-optimized coding sequences according to the algorithm described in the legend of Figure 2—figure supplement 1 . After designing each coding sequence , we inserted either ( 1 ) normal synthetic introns with the sequence gtaagttt ( n36 ) ttttcag , where n36 is a 36 bp random DNA sequence with 30% GC content; or ( 2 ) PATC introns ( Frøkjær-Jensen et al . , 2016 ) . Our design algorithm is accessible via a web interface at http://104 . 131 . 81 . 59/ , and the source code can be found at https://github . com/dannyhmg/germline; copy archived athttps://github . com/elifesciences-publications/germline . Germline-optimized sequences were synthesized as gBlocks ( Integrated DNA Technologies ) and single-copy transgenes were generated using standard methods ( Frøkjær-Jensen et al . , 2012 ) . Please refer to Supplementary file 2 for detailed sequence features of each transgene . loxP and loxN sequences were integrated in the endogenous loci of essential genes ( see CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing section for details ) . For the FLP recombinase , the hyperactive FLP G5D variant ( Schwartz and Jorgensen , 2016 ) was used ( pMLS262; Addgene #73718 ) . For germline-specific expression , we used a long version of the pie-1 promoter including enhancer sequences ( pAZ132 , a kind gift from A . A . Hyman ) . To initiate the recombination cascade , the germline-specific FLP expression vector was injected in P0 mothers with the following protocol to favor germline expression ( Personal communication Oliver Hobert , Worm Breeders Gazette , February 21 , 2013 ) ; linearized FLP construct ( 2 ng/µl ) , PvuII digested E . coli genomic DNA ( 150 ng/µl ) , co-injection marker Pmyo-2::tdtomato ( 2 ng/µl ) . Transgenic F1 animals were singled and allowed to lay eggs for at least 24 hr . From F1 with 100% embryonic lethal broods ( ric-8 and rgs-7 are essential for embryogenesis ) , early embryos were isolated and used for spindle severing experiments . Either the wild type N2 or SV1818 ( pha-1 ( e2123ts ) 4x outcrossed ) C . elegans genetic background was used for the generation of CRISPR/Cas9 alleles . Injection mixes with a total volume of 50 µl were prepared in MilliQ HR2RO and contained a combination of 50 ng/µl Peft-3:cas9 ( Addgene ID #46168 ( Friedland et al . , 2013 ) or 60 ng/µl pJW1285 ( Addgene ID #61252 [Dickinson et al . , 2013] ) , 50–100 ng/µl u6::sgRNA ( targeting genomic sequences listed in Supplementary file 2 ) , 50 ng/µl of ( PAGE-purified oligonucleotide ) repair template and 2 . 5 ng/µl of the co-injection pharyngeal marker myo-2p::tdtomato . Injection mixes were spun down in a microcentrifuge ( Eppendorf ) for at least 10 min at 13 , 000 RPM prior to use . Young adult hermaphrodites were injected in the germline using an inverted micro-injection setup ( Eppendorf ) . After injection , animals were singled and grown at 15 or 20˚C . F1 animals were then picked to a total of at least 96 , and grown with two or three animals per plate for 7–8 days at 20˚C until freshly starved . Half a plate containing F2 and F3 animals was then washed off with M9 medium supplemented with 0 . 05% Tween-20 , and subsequently lysed to extract genomic DNA . Some knock-ins were obtained using co-CRISPR selection: rescue of pha-1 ( e2123ts ) ( Ward , 2015 ) , generation of visible unc-22 ( Kim et al . , 2014 ) or dpy-10 ( Paix et al . , 2015 ) phenotypes , or integration of an self-excisable cassette carrying a visible marker ( Dickinson et al . , 2015 ) . Genotyping was carried out by PCR amplification with OneTaq polymerase ( New England Biolabs ) of genome sequences using primers annealing in the inserted sequence and a genomic region not included in the repair template . Confirmed alleles were subsequently sequenced ( Macrogen Europe ) . Prior to live imaging , embryos were dissected from adult hermaphrodites onto coverslips ( Menzel-Gläser ) in 0 . 8x egg salts buffer ( 94 mM NaCl , 32 mM KCl , 2 . 7 mM CaCl2 , 2 . 7 mM MgCl2 , 4 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 5; ( Tagawa et al . , 2001 ) or M9 , and mounted on 4% agarose pads . Spinning disk imaging of embryos was performed using a Nikon Eclipse Ti with Perfect Focus System , Yokogawa CSU-X1-A1 spinning disk confocal head , Plan Apo VC 60x N . A . 1 . 40 oil and S Fluor 100x N . A . 0 . 5–1 . 3 ( at 1 . 3 , used for UV-laser photo-ablation ) objectives , Photometrics Evolve 512 EMCCD camera , DV2 two-channel beam-splitter for simultaneous dual-color imaging , Vortran Stradus 405 nm ( 100 mW ) , Cobolt Calypso 491 nm ( 100 mW ) , Cobolt Jive 561 nm ( 100 mW ) , Vortran Stradus 642 nm ( 110 mW ) and Teem Photonics 355 nm Q-switched pulsed lasers controlled with the ILas system ( Roper Scientific France/PICT IBiSA , Institut Curie , used for photo-ablation ) , ET-GFP ( 49002 ) , ET-mCherry ( 49008 ) , ET-GFPmCherry ( 49022 ) and ET-Cy5 ( 49006 ) filters , ASI motorized stage MS-2000-XYZ with Piezo Top Plate , and Sutter LB10-3 filter wheel . The microscope was operated using MetaMorph 7 . 7 software and situated in a temperature-controlled room ( 20˚C ) . The temperature of the stage and objective was controlled at 25˚C with a Tokai Hit INUBG2E-ZILCS Stage Top Incubator during experiments . Images were acquired in either streaming mode with 250 or 500 ms exposure , or time-lapse mode with 250 , 500 or 1500 ms exposure and 2 or 5 s intervals . Laser power and exposure times were kept constant within experiments . For the quantification of membrane invaginations embryos were imaged by 250 ms exposure stream acquisition starting in the DNA plane at anaphase onset , as judged by GFP::tubulin signal . During anaphase , the spinning disk imaging plane was moved as close to the membrane as possible while keeping the cytosol discernable from the membrane signal . Acquisitions were terminated at early telophase , as judged by the PH::eGFP::LOV signal . For experiments involving balanced epdz::mcherry::dhc-1/+ , each animal was confirmed to be positive for epdz::mcherry::dhc-1 by fluorescence before the experiment . Images acquired by spinning disk microscopy were rotated , cropped , annotated , provided with scale bars , and processed further by linear adjustment of brightness and contrast using ImageJ and FIJI . Fluorophores used in this study include ( e ) GFP , mCherry , Alexa-488 , Alexa-568 and Atto 647N . For immunohistochemistry experiments L4 hermaphrodites were grown on RNAi plates seeded with HT115 Escherichia coli bacteria strains generating double-stranded RNA ( dsRNA ) targeting genes of interest ( goa-1 , gpa-16 , gpr-1 ) for 48 hr at 15˚C prior to fixation ( Timmons and Fire , 1998 ) . For all other gene knock-down experiments , young adult hermaphrodites were injected with dsRNA targeting genes of interest ( goa-1 , gpa-16 , gpr-1 , ric-8 , rgs-7 ) and grown for 48 hr at 15˚C ( Fire et al . , 1998 ) prior to experiments . To generate dsRNA , coding regions of genes of interest were PCR amplified using Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase ( New England Biolabs ) . These PCR products were used as templates for in vitro dsRNA synthesis ( MEGAscript T7 transcription kit , ThermoFisher Scientific ) . dsRNA was diluted 5x in DEPC HR2RO prior to micro-injection . ORF clones from the Vidal and Ahringer RNAi libraries were used ( Kamath et al . , 2003; Rual et al . , 2004 ) . Mitotic spindle severing was performed in essence as described ( Grill et al . , 2001; Portegijs et al . , 2016 ) . One-cell embryos expressing GFP- or mCherry-labeled tubulin were imaged during mitosis using the spinning disk microscope setup described above , equipped with a Teem Photonics 355 nm Q-switched pulsed laser controlled with the ILas system ( Roper Scientific France/PICT IBiSA , Institut Curie ) . At anaphase onset , as judged by spindle morphology and mobility , spindles were severed as shown in Figure 1c and Video 2 . Centrosome displacement was recorded by 500 ms exposure streaming acquisition , and peak velocities were subsequently extrapolated using the FIJI TrackMate plugin . Dark state experiments were performed on the spinning disk setup described above . For local photoactivation of LOV2 in C . elegans embryos , light was applied in a region of variable size depending on each individual experiment using a 491 nm laser controlled with the ILas system ( Roper Scientific France/PICT IBiSA , Institut Curie ) . Due to high sensitivity of LOV2 to blue light and variations in laser power , embryos of strain SV2061 ( expressing diffuse ePDZ::mCherry and PH::eGFP::LOV ) were used to calibrate the amount of laser power required for local activation of LOV2 prior to experiments . During both global and local photoactivation assays and dark state spindle severing experiments embryos were kept away from blue light as much as practically feasible . To this end , aluminum foil was used to cover the microscope setup , and optical filters were inserted in the light path to remove LOV2-activating wavelengths from the transmitted light used to locate embryos on slides . Prior to experimental use of embryos , unintended premature cortical recruitment of ePDZ-mCherry or ePDZ-mCherry-LIN-5 was assessed by observation of mCherry localization patterns . For immunostaining of C . elegans embryos , embryos were dissected from adults in 10 µl MilliQ HR2RO on slides coated with poly-L-lysine . Samples were then freeze-cracked and fixed in methanol for 5 min . at −20˚C and subsequently in acetone for 5 min . at −20˚C . Embryos were then rehydrated in phosphate buffered saline +0 . 05% Tween-20 ( PBST ) , blocked for 1 hr at 4˚C in PBST +1% bovine serum albumin and 1% goat serum ( Sigma-Aldrich ) , and then incubated at room temperature with primary antibodies for 1 hr and then with secondary antibodies for 45 min . , both in blocking solution , with four 10 min washes in PBST following each antibody mix . Finally , embryos were embedded in ProLong Gold Antifade with DAPI . Primary antibodies used were mouse anti-LIN-5 [1:10 , ( Lorson et al . , 2000 ) , mouse anti-FLAG M2 ( Sigma-Aldrich ) and rabbit anti-DHC-1 ( 1:100 ( Gonczy et al . , 1999 ) ; a kind gift from P . Gönczy ) . Secondary antibodies used were goat anti-rabbit Alexa-488 , goat anti-rabbit Alexa-568 , goat anti-mouse Alexa-488 , goat anti-mouse Alexa-568 ( Invitrogen ) and goat anti-mouse Atto 647N ( Sigma-Aldrich ) , all at 1:500 dilution in blocking solution . Imaging of immunolabeled embryos was performed on the spinning disk setup described above . All quantitative spinning disk image analyses were performed in either ImageJ or FIJI . For quantification of membrane invaginations , movies were limited to the 200 frames ( 50 s ) preceding the onset of telophase . Images were then cropped to include the outer limits of the PH::eGFP signal . Transient cortical dots were tracked manually using the MTrackJ ImageJ plugin . Larger , more static structures result from membrane ruffles , which are distinct from the more dynamic invaginations , as can be seen in Video 11 . To yield the distribution of invaginations on the length axis of the visible embryo cortex , recorded x coordinates were incremented into groups of 5% embryo length each . To quantify the cortical recruitment and dynamics of ePDZ::mCherry , ePDZ::mCherry::GPR-1 , LIN-5::ePDZ::mCherry and ePDZ::mCherry::DHC-1 by PH::eGFP::LOV , multiple 20 px wide linescans were drawn perpendicular to the membrane per analyzed embryo . An intensity profile was plotted per linescan at each acquired time point , from each of which an average of the maximum three pixel values was extracted to yield the peak intensity values at the membrane . Each intensity measurement was first corrected for background noise with a value measured outside of the embryo in a 50 × 50 px region of interest , and cortex to cytoplasm intensity ratios were calculated using average cytoplasmic intensity measurements in a 50 × 50 or 29 × 23 px region of interest at all timepoints analyzed . Fluorescence intensity measurements as measure for Cre ( FLPon ) activation ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ) were taken as total embryo average intensity minus background signal using ImageJ measurement tool . The half time of ePDZ-LOV interaction after a pulse activation was inferred from a non-linear , single component regression . All numerical data processing and graph generation was performed using Excel 2011 ( Microsoft ) and Prism 7 ( GraphPad software , inc . ) . All data were shown as means with SEM . Statistical significance as determined using two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-tests , Mann-Whitney U tests and the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test . Correlation coefficients between two data sets were calculated using Pearson r correlation tests or Spearman rank correlation tests . Data sets were assessed for their fit to a Gaussian distribution using the D’Agostino-Pearson omnibus K2 normality test prior to application of appropriate statistical test . A p-value of <0 . 05 was considered significant . *p<0 . 05; **p<0 . 01; ***p<0 . 001; ****p<0 . 0001 . All statistical analyses were performed in Prism 7 ( GraphPad software , inc . ) .

{"doi": "elife-02798-v1", "abstract": "Recovery from sensory deprivation is slow and incomplete in adult visual cortex . In this study , we show that visual stimulation during locomotion , which increases the gain of visual responses in primary visual cortex , dramatically enhances recovery in the mouse . Excitatory neurons regained normal levels of response , while narrow-spiking ( inhibitory ) neurons remained less active . Visual stimulation or locomotion alone did not enhance recovery . Responses to the particular visual stimuli viewed by the animal during locomotion recovered , while those to another normally effective stimulus did not , suggesting that locomotion promotes the recovery only of the neural circuits that are activated concurrent with the locomotion . These findings may provide an avenue for improving recovery from amblyopia in humans .", "plain language summary": "Amblyopia , otherwise known as ‘lazy eye’ , is a condition in which vision fails to develop normally during childhood , not due to problems with the eye itself but due to problems with the transmission of information from the eye to the brain . It occurs when disorders such as squint—in which the eyes point in different directions—cause the brain to continually ignore input from one eye , with the result that vision in that eye never fully develops . If detected in infancy , amblyopia can be treated by surgery , although such interventions must be performed early because they are much less effective when used on adults . However , Kaneko and Stryker now present data suggesting that the adult mammalian visual system may be more amenable to change than previously thought . Young mice were deprived of visual input to one eye , by having an eyelid sewn shut , during a critical period in the development of their visual systems . When the eye was re-opened at the age of 4–5 months , the mice showed reduced responses in the brain region corresponding to that eye . However , if the mice were then allowed to run on a treadmill for several hours a day while viewing a visual stimulus—either black and white gratings or random noise—the vision in their deprived eye showed a rapid and striking improvement . This improvement was not seen in mice that ran without a visual stimulus , or in mice that looked at the visual stimulus but did not run . Moreover , the improvement was specific to the particular stimulus viewed whilst running . Although the mechanism behind this effect is unclear , it is known that running increases neuronal activity , and one possibility is that neurons that are active simultaneously—such as those encoding the visual stimulus—form stronger connections with one another: ‘neurons that fire together , wire together’ . Further work is required to determine whether similar changes occur in the human visual system and , if they do , whether they could be applied to the treatment of amblyopia .", "article": "1 Introduction Depriving one eye of normal patterned vision during early life causes a loss of visual acuity ( amblyopia ) and neurons in the visual cortex lose responsiveness through the deprived eye . If such abnormal vision is left uncorrected , recovery of visual function in adulthood is slow and incomplete , both in humans and in higher mammals , reflecting the limited plasticity of mature cortex ( Hubel and Wiesel , 1970; Mitchell and Sengpiel , 2009 ) . The recent discovery that neurons in mouse visual cortex respond with more than two times the number of action potentials during active locomotion than when still ( Niell and Stryker , 2010 ) led us to test whether this enhanced response might facilitate recovery from the effects of early-onset , long-term monocular visual deprivation ( MD ) . 2 Results Monocular deprivation was initiated by suturing shut the right eyelid of C57BL/6 mice early in the critical period ( P22–24 ) and was continued to 4 to 5 months of age . The right eye was then re-opened to allow for binocular vision ( BV ) , and baseline cortical responses through the two eyes were recorded using intrinsic signal imaging . Both eyes remained open afterward , and changes in responsiveness were measured over the next 3 weeks ( Figure 1A ) . For 4 hr each day during these 21 days of BV ( 21d-BV ) , experimental animals viewed a visual stimulus ( VS ) while being permitted to run on a freely rotating spherical treadmill with their heads fixed . We used contrast-modulated stochastic noise matched to the spatiotemporal frequency response of the mouse as the visual stimulus because it drives nearly all cells in the primary visual cortex to some extent ( Niell and Stryker , 2008 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 02798 . 003Figure 1 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 02798 . 006 In control mice that were kept in the standard housing condition ( home-cage ) , cortical responses to the closed eye in binocular visual cortex slowly increased over 21d-BV , at which point they were still well below the range of age-matched mice with normal visual experience ( Figure 1B , D ) . In contrast , mice that experienced the noise stimulus during their daily running ( VS+run ) showed a remarkable increase in closed-eye responses after only 7 days of BV ( Figure 1C , D ) . Examined in a separate set of animals , this effect of VS+run was already significant after 3 days of training ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . Responses through the open eye did not change significantly in either group ( Figure 1B , C , E ) . As a result , the ocular dominance index ( ODI ) , computed as a normalized difference between responses to two eyes , recovered much more rapidly in animals with visual experience during running than in controls ( Figure 1F ) . Recovery using reverse occlusion ( switching the eye closure ) instead of BV was similarly enhanced by VS+run ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ) . To determine whether VS or running alone enhances recovery , we tested two more groups of mice: one that ran on the ball without VS ( run-only ) and one that viewed the visual noise stimulus in the home cage but did not run on the ball ( VS-only ) . Closed-eye responses and ODI in both of these groups increased only slowly , similar to those of the home-cage control group ( Figure 1G , I ) . Running velocity and duration were similar between run-only and VS+run groups ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3 ) . VS+run enhanced recovery of monocular visual areas as well ( Figure 2 ) . This effect was rapid ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) and was particularly prominent for a secondary monocular area , where the home cage and the run-only groups showed no significant improvement even after 21 days of BV . 10 . 7554/eLife . 02798 . 007Figure 2 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 02798 . 008 Perception in humans can be strengthened by training in an experience-specific manner ( reviewed in Sagi , 2011 ) , and responses in mouse visual cortex are reported to do so as well ( Frenkel et al . , 2006 ) . We next tested whether recovery of closed-eye responses is preferentially enhanced to the particular visual stimuli presented during running . Mice viewed either square bars drifting in eight evenly-spaced directions ( barVS ) or the contrast-modulated noise ( noiseVS ) during running each day for 3 weeks . Intrinsic signal responses to both bar and noise stimuli were measured weekly . Mice that experienced barVS+run showed significantly greater recovery of closed-eye responses to bars than to noise ( Figure 3 ) . Likewise , mice that experienced noiseVS+run showed significantly greater recovery of response to noise than to bars ( Figure 3 ) . Responses to the stimulus that was not experienced during running were similar to those in control mice presented with a blank screen during running . These observations reveal that enhanced recovery is stimulus-specific and suggest that only the specific visual cortical circuits that are active during locomotion recover . 10 . 7554/eLife . 02798 . 009Figure 3 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 02798 . 009 To reveal changes in response properties of individual neurons , we made extracellular single unit recordings from neurons in layers 2/3 and 4 of binocular V1 contralateral to the closed eye . The use of 16-site silicon probes and spike-sorting methods ( Niell and Stryker , 2008 ) enabled unbiased sampling from both responsive and unresponsive units . We examined five groups of mice with different treatments ( Figure 4A ) . We first describe results from the broad-spiking , presumed excitatory cells that constitute ∼80% of the recordings . 10 . 7554/eLife . 02798 . 010Figure 4 .

We used the earth mover distance algorithm ( Y Rubner et al . , A metric for distributions with applications to image databases . Proc . IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision , Bombay , India , January 1998 , pp . 59–66 ) to calculate the fictive correspondence between the 500 most responsive individual neurons of A and either B or C as the minimum total distance required to move the points of one distribution into the other , cartooned for simple cases in D for noise and G for grating responses . The flow field of movement vectors ( arrows in D and G ) is plotted for each recovery condition as a heat map of the summed components along the noise response axis ( E and F ) or grating response axis ( H and I ) . Color bar inset in H indicates four spikes/sec along noise F1 response axis in E and F and 15 spikes/sec along grating response axis in H and I . These heat maps show that the effect of noise stimulation was to increase the response to noise stimuli selectively in neurons that were initially more responsive to noise than to gratings , as indicated by warm spots above the diagonal in E and lack of warm spots in H . The effect of grating stimulation was to increase the response to grating stimuli selectively in neurons that were initially more responsive to gratings than to noise , as indicated by warm spots below the diagonal in I , and paucity of warm spots in F , ( p<0 . 001 for all comparisons E vs H , F vs I , Chi-square ) .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 02798 . 012 Consistent with the intrinsic signal observations as described above , closed-eye responses in mice that viewed visual stimuli while running during 7d-BV recovered significantly from their profoundly decreased level after long-term monocular deprivation ( LTMD ) , in a stimulus-specific manner ( Figure 4 , Figure 4—figure supplements 1 , 2 ) . Closed-eye responses to the optimal grating ( preferred orientation and spatial frequency ) were most increased in grating+run mice among groups ( Figure 4B ) , while responses to contrast-modulated noise were improved most in noise+run mice ( Figure 4C ) . Open-eye responses did not differ among four groups of monocularly deprived mice ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) . As a result , ocular dominance recovered to normal levels with similar stimulus specificity ( Figure 4B , C ) . In normal animals , the majority of cells in layers 2–4 are orientation-selective ( OSI >0 . 5 , Figure 5A , B ) and the OSI for the two eyes is similar in each binocular cell ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1B ) . Closed-eye OSIs and the binocular correlation of OSI were significantly improved only in grating+run mice but not in other groups ( Figure 5A , B , Figure 5—figure supplement 1B ) . Prolonged MD caused mismatch of the preferred orientation of two eyes ( Figure 5C , D ) , consistent with requirement of binocular visual experience during the critical period to develop orientation matching ( Wang et al . , 2010 ) . 7d-BV improved binocular matching almost to normal levels in grating+run but not in home-cage or noise+run , mice ( Figure 5C , D ) . In addition , the distribution of the preferred spatial frequency in closed-eye responses was almost normalized in grating+run mice but not in home-cage or noise+run mice . ( Figure 5E , F ) . Such shifts in preferred spatial frequency may account for improvements in behaviorally measured acuity ( Mitchell and Sengpiel , 2009 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 02798 . 017Figure 5 .

In response to the contrast-modulated noise stimuli , the peak firing of a cell occurs at the frequency of contrast modulation ( F1 , at 0 . 1 Hz ) . We assessed contrast sensitivity by calculating average value of contrast that elicits half-maximal response ( C1/2 ) . Contrast sensitivity was significantly impaired after LTMD and was restored almost completely in noise+run mice but not in gratings+run mice ( Figure 6 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 02798 . 019Figure 6 . Change in contrast sensitivity in broad-spiking cells . Average values of contrast that gives half-maximal response are shown . Horizontal lines above bars; black: p<0 . 01 , grey: p<0 . 05 . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 02798 . 019 Narrow-spiking cells are thought to correspond to inhibitory , predominantly fast-spiking , interneurons ( McCormick et al . , 1985; Bartho et al . , 2004 ) . Although a minority population , inhibitory cells play an important role in plasticity ( Espinosa and Stryker , 2012 ) . We observed several notable differences between broad- and narrow-spiking cells in the changes following LTMD and 7d-BV . First , spontaneous activity of narrow-spiking cells was greatly reduced after LTMD and did not change significantly after 7d-BV regardless of the treatment ( Figure 7C , D ) , whereas those of broad-spiking cells were elevated after LTMD and significantly decreased toward normal level in mice after 7d-BV ( Figure 7A , B ) . These opposite changes in spontaneous firing between broad- and narrow-spiking cells may reflect a homeostatic mechanism that alters excitatory–inhibitory balance to maintain cortical activity during prolonged deprivation . Second , recovery of closed-eye responses and ocular dominance to the gratings in narrow-spiking cells was only modest even in grating+run mice ( Figure 8A , Figure 8—figure supplement 1A ) , whereas it was nearly complete in broad-spiking cells ( Figure 4B ) . Third , responses of narrow-spiking cells to contrast-modulated noise through the deprived eye and ocular dominance were incompletely restored both in noise+run and grating+run mice to similar extents , showing no preference for the experienced stimulus ( Figure 8B , Figure 8—figure supplement 1B ) . Fourth , responses of narrow-spiking cells through the open-eye were not elevated after LTMD either to the noise or grating stimulus , and did not change significantly in any of 7d-BV mice ( Figure 8—figure supplement 1A , B ) . This lack of potentiation of open-eye responses during LTMD in narrow-spiking cells may contribute to potentiation of those in broad-spiking cells . The responses of narrow-spiking cells after LTMD suggest that deprivation reduces intracortical inhibition . Such a reduction may provide a starting point that allows meager deprived-eye excitatory pathways of the cortical circuit to drive activity upon re-opening . The incomplete recovery of orientation tuning of broad-spiking cells in spite of nearly full restoration of the magnitudes of responses may result from the very limited recovery in narrow-spiking cells , as inhibition is critical for generation of sharp orientation tuning in upper layer neurons in the primary visual cortex ( Liu et al . , 2011 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 02798 . 020Figure 7 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 02798 . 022 3 Discussion Recovery in adulthood from amblyopia induced by monocular visual deprivation during early life is slow and far from complete , even weeks after opening the deprived eye ( Hubel and Wiesel , 1970; Mitchell and Sengpiel , 2009 ) . In this study , we have used intrinsic signal imaging and single cell recording to find that locomotion , which is known to increase visual responses ( Niell and Stryker , 2010 ) , dramatically enhances the recovery of visual responses , almost to normal levels within a week . Surprisingly , the recovery of response was specific to the particular visual stimuli presented during locomotion . Neither locomotion alone nor visual stimulation alone promoted recovery . These findings suggest that recovery is facilitated only in the neural circuits that are activated during running . Other manipulations have been reported to enhance adult plasticity ( Bavelier et al . , 2010 ) , such as dark exposure ( He et al . , 2007 ) , environmental enrichment ( Sale et al . , 2007 ) , and antidepressant treatment ( Maya Vetencourt et al . , 2008 ) . These treatments have in common a decrease in intracortical inhibition , consistent with our finding of reduced activity of inhibitory neurons . Such treatments may also increase locomotion , producing an active cortical state that facilitates plasticity . Interestingly , active hunting by barn owls , flying rather than walking or running in this case , dramatically increases adaptive plasticity of the auditory map in the superior colliculus ( Bergan et al . , 2005 ) . A number of mechanisms may contribute to the enhanced recovery described here . Locomotion may induce activity in neuromodulatory circuits that might enhance cortical function or plasticity ( Carcea and Froemke , 2013 ) , and it may also produce hemodynamic changes that might affect the operation of the cortical circuit ( Seifert and Secher , 2011 ) . The stimulus specificity of enhanced recovery , however , rules out any general explanation of recovery as an increase in cortical response to any stimulus . Most simply , the larger responses of the cortical neurons themselves during locomotion would be expected to enhance recovery through the operation of any Hebbian or spike-timing based plasticity mechanism that depends on neural activity ( Feldman , 2009 ) . Plasticity of excitatory connections would be further enhanced by the opposite changes in spontaneous firing of broad- and narrow-spiking neurons . The present findings do not allow a rigorous test of the hypothesis that Hebbian changes are responsible for the stimulus specificity of recovery; i . e . , that the neurons or synapses that are driven better by the specific stimuli presented during locomotion become more powerful . Such a test would require monitoring of the responses of individual cells or the efficacy of the synapses that they make throughout the recovery period . However , responses to both grating and noise stimuli were measured in three large populations of broad-spiking neurons , one before recovery and two in separate groups of animals after recovery during exposure to grating or noise . Making a correspondence between the individual neurons in these samples , in order to create fictive repeated measures from the same neurons , may suggest whether the present data are compatible with the Hebbian hypothesis . Indeed , the fictive longitudinal data show that noise stimulation increased the responses of neurons originally responding better to noise more than it did for the neurons that responded better to grating , and vice versa ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2 ) . These findings are consistent with the Hebbian hypothesis . In human visual cortex , it is unknown whether neuronal responses or plasticity are enhanced by locomotion . In monkeys , attention modulates the gain of cortical responses in higher visual areas , but these effects are very much smaller in V1 and smaller than those of locomotion in mice ( Maunsell and Cook , 2002; Reynolds and Chelazzi , 2004 ) . It will be interesting to determine whether V1 responses in humans are enhanced by locomotion and whether recovery from amblyopia in humans can be similarly enhanced . 4 Materials and methods C57BL/6 wild-type breeders were purchased from Jackson Laboratory ( Bar Harbor , ME ) and bred as needed . Animals were maintained in the animal facility at University of California San Francisco and used in accordance with Protocol AN098080-01D approved by the UCSF Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee . Monocular deprivation ( MD ) was performed as described ( Gordon and Stryker , 1996 ) except that 2–3% isoflurane in oxygen was used for anesthesia . The lid of the right eye was sutured shut at P22–24 . Mice were housed in the standard condition ( 12/12 dark–light cycle , free access to food and water ) until P135∼150 , at which time a custom stainless steel plate for head fixation was attached to the skull with dental acrylic under isoflurane anesthesia . The exposed surface of the skull was covered with a thin coat of nitrocellulose ( New-Skin , Medtech Products Inc . , NY ) to prevent desiccation , reactive cell growth , and destruction of the bone structure . Animals were given a subcutaneous injection of carprofen ( 5 mg/kg ) as a post-operative analgesic . 5–7 days after head-plate implantation , the closed eyelid was re-opened and groups of mice for the intrinsic signal imaging study underwent the first imaging session ( day 0 ) . The re-opened eyelid was left open afterward to allow binocular vision while animals were subjected to the different regimes of visual stimulation and locomotion as follows . ( 1 ) running with visual stimulation: The mouse was allowed to freely move its limbs and trunk on a foam ball floated on a stream of air , while its head was fixed via the implanted headplate that could be screwed into a rigid crossbar above the floating ball as described ( Niell and Stryker , 2010 ) . Two optical mice were used to measure the displacement of the ball as the mouse moved , allowing us to calculate the physical speed of the ball ( Niell and Stryker , 2010 ) . After re-opening the deprived eye , each animal spent 4 hr daily on the ball while viewing visual stimulus , over next 3 weeks ( for intrinsic signal optical imaging ) or 6 days ( for single unit recording ) . Running was performed during the dark phase of the housing cycle , because we found that mice ran for longer times during this phase . ( 2 ) running without visual stimulation: Each animal ran on the floating ball exactly as the first group but viewed only a blank , mid-gray screen ( ∼35 lux ) . ( 3 ) visual stimulation alone without running ( intrinsic signal imaging only ) : a transparent cage containing a group of mice with regular bedding materials was surrounded by four monitors with the distance of 25 cm between the center of the cage and the monitor . The visual stimulus was presented on the monitors continuously for 7–8 hr daily during which animals were allowed to behave freely without disruption by the experimenter . We extended the duration to 7–8 hr because animals were obviously active only 50–60% of time . ( 4 ) no running , no visual stimulation: mice were housed in the standard condition without running or specific visual stimulation . ( 5 ) Non-deprived control for single unit recording only: age-matched control animals , many of them being in the same litter as those in experimental groups , were housed in the standard condition with normal visual experience without running or specific visual stimulation . The daily visual stimulus for animals used in intrinsic signal imaging was either contrast-modulated noise movies or drifting square bars at the full range of orientations . The stimulus for mice employed in single unit recordings was either the noise or drifting sinusoidal gratings . Stimuli were generated in Matlab using Psychophysics Toolbox extensions ( Brainard , 1997; Pelli , 1997 ) , and displayed on a LCD monitor ( 60-Hz refresh rate ) placed 25 cm from the mouse , spanning 52 . 5° ( height ) × 70° ( width ) of visual space . The drifting bar was full-length of the monitor , width of 2° , velocity of 25°/s , and drifting in eight equally spaced directions . The drifting sinusoidal gratings were shown for a duration of 1 . 5 s , at temporal frequency of 2 Hz , spatial frequency of 0 . 01 , 0 . 02 , 0 . 04 , 0 . 08 , 0 . 16 , 0 . 32 , and 0 ( full-field flicker ) cycles/° ( cpd ) , in 12 equally spaced directions . The contrast-modulated Gaussian noise movie consisted of the Fourier-inversion of a randomly generated spatiotemporal spectrum with low-pass spatial and temporal cutoffs applied at 0 . 05 cpd and 4 Hz , respectively . To provide contrast modulation , the movie was multiplied by a sinusoid with a 10-s period . Movies were generated at 60 ×60 pixels and then smoothly interpolated by the video card to 480 × 480 to appear 30 × 30 cm on the monitor and played at 30 frames per second . Each movie was 5 min long and repeated for 4 hr total presentation . 5–7 days after the headplate implantation , the first imaging of intrinsic signals was performed to measure baseline responses through each eye . The mouse was anesthetized with isoflurane ( 3% for induction and 0 . 7% during recording ) supplemented with intramuscular injection of chlorprothixene chloride ( 2 µg/g body weight ) , and the closed eyelid was carefully opened by slitting horizontally at the center of the fused lid just before the imaging session . Repeated optical imaging of intrinsic signals was performed as described ( Kaneko et al . , 2008 ) . We monitored the concentration of isoflurane using an Ohmeda 5250 RGM ( Datex-Ohmeda , Madison , WI ) throughout each imaging session . Images were recorded transcranially through the window of the implanted headplate . Intrinsic signal images were obtained with a Dalsa 1M30 CCD camera ( Dalsa , Waterloo , Canada ) with a 135 × 50 mm tandem lens ( Nikon Inc . , Melville , NY ) and red interference filter ( 610 ± 10 nm ) . Frames were acquired at a rate of 30 fps , temporally binned by four frames , and stored as 512 × 512 pixel images after binning the 1024 × 1024 camera pixels by 2 × 2 pixels spatially . We used two kinds of visual stimuli presented between −5° and 15° ( azimuth ) on the stimulus monitor ( 0° = center of the monitor aligned to center of the mouse ) to record intrinsic signals in the binocular visual cortex: ( 1 ) 2°-wide bars , moving continuously and periodically upward or downward at a speed of 10°/sec; ( 2 ) the contrast-modulated noise movie , as described above . To record in the monocular visual area , the contrast-modulated noise was presented between 50° and 70° ( azimuth ) of the visual field . Visual stimuli were presented on a 40 × 30 cm monitor placed 25 cm in front of the mouse . The phase and amplitude of cortical responses at the stimulus frequency were extracted by Fourier analysis as described ( Kalatsky and Stryker , 2003 ) . Response amplitude was an average of at least four measurements . Ocular dominance index was computed as ( R − L ) / ( R + L ) , where R and L are the peak response amplitudes through the right eye and the left eye , respectively , as described ( Kaneko et al . , 2008 ) . All mice were kept under standard housing conditions with free access to food and water between recordings and daily running on the treadmill . Data acquisition , visual stimuli , and spike analyses were performed as described ( Niell and Stryker , 2008 ) with minor modifications . Briefly , after locating the binocular area of the primary visual cortex by recording intrinsic signals elicited by ipsilateral eye stimulation , a small craniotomy ( ∼2 mm diameter ) was made over the binocular area through the window of the implanted headplate . A silicon multisite electrode with a tetrode configuration ( model a2 × 2-tet-3mm-150-121 , Neuronexus Technologies , MI ) was inserted to a depth of <400 μm below the cortical surface to record cells in layer 2/3 and 4 . Visual stimuli were generated in Matlab using the Psychophysics Toolbox extensions and displayed on a monitor placed 25 cm in front of the mouse as described above . In each animal in all treatment groups , the responsiveness of cells was measured using both drifting sinusoidal gratings and the contrast-modulated noise movie , as described above . Neuronal signals ( spikes ) were acquired using a System 3 workstation ( Tucker–Davis Technologies , FL ) and analyzed with custom software in Matlab ( MathWorks , MA ) . Single units were identified by clustering spike waveforms using the FastICA Matlab package and KlustaKwik ( Harris et al . , 2000 ) . Units were classified as broad- or narrow-spiking based on trough-to-peak time and the slope of the waveform 0 . 5 ms after the initial trough as described ( Niell and Stryker , 2008 ) . Drifting sinusoidal gratings as described above ( 2 . 5 min/set ) were repeated six times for each eye ( 30 min total ) . The average spontaneous firing rate for each unit was calculated by averaging the rate over all blank condition presentations . Responses to each orientation and spatial frequency were calculated by averaging the spike rate during the 1 . 5 s presentation and subtracting the spontaneous firing rate . For assessing ocular dominance , we first selected units responsive to the optimal grating ( ≥ 2 . 0 spikes/s ) through either eye and then calculated ODI for each unit as the difference between the contralateral ( deprived ) and ipsilateral ( open ) eyes divided by the sum of the two eyes' responses ( Kaneko et al . , 2008 ) . The preferred orientation was determined by averaging the response across all spatial frequencies , and calculating half the complex phase of the value ∑F ( θ ) e2iθ∑F ( θ ) . Given this fixed preferred orientation θpref , the tuning curve was fitted with the sum of two Gaussians centered on θpref and θpref + π , of different amplitudes A1 and A2 but equal width θ , with a constant baseline B . From this fit , we derived an orientation selectivity index ( OSI ) and the width of the selectivity tuning . OSI was calculated as the depth of modulation from the preferred orientation to its orthogonal orientation θortho = θpref + π /2 , as ( Rpref − Rortho ) / ( Rpref + Rortho ) . Tuning width was the half-width at half-maximum of the fit above the baseline . The difference in preferred orientation between the two eyes was calculated by subtracting ipsilateral from contralateral preferred orientation along the 180° cycle ( −90° ∼ +90° ) . The absolute values of these differences were used in statistical analyses . The spatial frequency tuning curve was determined from the response at the preferred orientation ( θpref ) described above and was fit to a difference of two Gaussians . We probed the overall responsiveness of cells using movies of stochastic noise with defined spatial and temporal frequency spectra . The contrast of movies was periodically modulated so that each movie transitioned sinusoidally from a gray background to full contrast movie and back to gray again , with a 10-s period . This generally resulted in a periodic modulation of firing and also helped to maintain high firing rates throughout the presentation by preventing habituation . The movie was shown for 10–15 min for each eye , and the cells' responsiveness was presented as the response amplitude at the frequency of the contrast modulation ( F1 response , the first harmonic at 0 . 1 Hz ) . A form of contrast–response curve was generated by plotting the averaged response over all cycles to the contrast . Average value of the contrast that elicits half-maximal response ( C1/2 ) was used to measure contrast sensitivity . Data were presented as mean ± SEM or median ± SE in the main text , as well as cumulative frequency distributions in the supplemental figures , unless otherwise indicated . Standard error of the median was calculated by a bootstrap . Response magnitudes and ocular dominance index data obtained from intrinsic signal imaging experiments were analyzed by using repeated measures ANOVA to assess changes from baseline as well as differences between treatments , which were followed by multiple comparisons with Bonferroni correction . Electrophysiological single unit data were analyzed using either one-way ANOVA ( for normally distributed data ) or Kruskal–Wallis one-way ANOVA ( for the rest ) , followed by Bonferroni or Dunn multiple comparisons between treatments . Difference in cumulative frequency distribution was analyzed using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test . These statistical analyses were performed using Prism 5 ( GraphPad Software , CA ) or Matlab ( MathWorks , MA ) ."}

This implies that the symbiotic partnership manages a combination of oxidative and enzymatic biomass degradation , an achievement that surpasses current human bioconversion technology .", "plain language summary": "Colonies of tropical leaf-cutting ants live in underground nests where a fungus grows that feeds them . The ants , in turn , provide the fungus with the freshly-cut leaf fragments it needs for nutrition . The relationship between the ants and the fungus , in which they live close together and help one another survive , is known as symbiosis . It is an ancient , extremely well integrated relationship , in which neither species can survive without the other . However , the details of how the ants and the fungus work together to break down the leaf fragments so they can be used for nutrition are not well understood . When the ants eat the fungus , they do not digest its enzymes ( the proteins that accelerate chemical reactions in a cell ) . Instead , the fungal enzymes travel through the ants’ gut and into their fecal liquid , which gets deposited on the fresh-cut leaves when the ants collect them . The ants then make temporary pellets out of the new leaf fragments before providing them to the fungus . To better understand how each species contributes to the breakdown of the leaf fragments , Schiøtt and Boomsma identified all the proteins present in the fecal fluid of the ants . Once they had a complete list of about 100 proteins , they determined which of them were produced by the fungus and which by the ant . Schiøtt and Boomsma observed that certain combinations of fungal and ant enzymes could trigger a Fenton reaction – a chemical reaction that efficiently begins the breakdown of the tough walls around plant cells . This reaction is so aggressive that it is rarely found in nature , but it could help explain the high efficiency of the fungus and the ants symbiotically processing leaf fragments . But could a Fenton reaction actually proceed in the ants’ nest without hurting the ants or affecting the rest of the fungal garden ? The evidence obtained suggested that the temporary pellets made by the ants serve to isolate the reaction , so the aggressive chemistry takes place away from the ants and detached from the fungal gardens . Schiøtt and Boomsma showed that the symbiotic relationship between the ants and the fungus has led to a sustainable and efficient way of breaking down plant materials to use them for nutrition . The Fenton reaction is economically important in many industries , including bioethanol production , the detergent industry , and food production . Emulating the methods used by leaf-cutting ants , which have been fine-tuned by millions of years of natural selection , may allow humans to develop more efficient technologies for breaking down organic compounds .", "article": "1 Introduction Mutualistic mergers of simpler biological entities into organizationally complex symbioses have been key steps in the evolution of advanced synergistic forms of life , but understanding the origins and secondary elaborations of such natural cooperative systems remains a major challenge for evolutionary biology ( Smith and Szathmáry , 1997; Bourke , 2011 ) . Physiological complementarity may be a main driver to maintain symbiotic associations , but new adaptations are also expected to jointly exploit the full potential of symbiosis ( Herre et al . , 1999; Foster and Wenseleers , 2006 ) . The leaf-cutting ants belong to the genera Acromyrmex and Atta and form the phylogenetic crown group of the attine fungus-growing ants , which all live in mutualistic symbiosis with fungus-garden symbionts ( Mueller et al . , 2005 ) . While the basal branches of the attine clade farm a considerable diversity of mostly leucocoprinaceous fungi , normally in underground chambers ( Branstetter et al . , 2017 ) , the leaf-cutting ants almost exclusively farm what has been described as the highly variable cultivar species Leucocoprinus gongylophorus ( Schultz and Brady , 2008 ) . The ants cut leaf fragments from the canopy and understory and bring them back to their nest to be processed as growth substrate for the cultivar . This involves chewing forage material into smaller pieces , which are mixed with fecal fluid and deposited as new substrate on the actively growing parts of the garden ( Weber , 1966 ) . The deep ancestors of the attine ants and their fungal cultivars were hunter-gatherers and saprotrophs ( Schultz and Brady , 2008 ) , respectively , which implies that none of them were adapted for efficiently degrading fresh plant material . Neither was there any need initially , because all phylogenetically basal attine ants provision their gardens with dead plant debris . There is a striking difference between the small colonies of these basal attine ants and the large colonies of leaf-cutting ants which are conspicuous functional herbivores with a large ecological footprint ( Mehdiabadi and Schultz , 2010; Mueller , 2002; Shik et al . , 2021 ) . However , most of the leaves that the ants harvest are heavily protected against herbivory by recalcitrant cell walls and toxic substances ( Chen , 2008 ) , defenses that needed to be overcome for obtaining net nutrition . In recent decades , a substantial amount of research has elucidated the selection forces that shaped the functional herbivory niche of the leaf-cutting ants . It was shown that: 1 . the ‘higher’ attine ants to which the leaf-cutting ants belong rear specialized , gongylidia-producing cultivars that lost their free-living relatives and could thus begin to co-evolve with the ants ( Schultz and Brady , 2008 ) ; 2 . the leaf-cutting ant cultivar Leucocoprinus gongylophorus evolved to be obligatorily multinucleate and polyploid , which may well have allowed higher crop productivity ( Kooij et al . , 2015a ) ; 3 . leaf-cutting ant queens evolved to be multiply inseminated , in contrast to all phylogenetically more basal attines studied; this meant that not only the garden symbiont but also the farming ant families became genetically ‘chimeric’ , albeit not as cell-lines but as lines of fungal nuclei and individual patrilines of ants ( Villesen et al . , 2002 ) ; 4 . the leaf-cutting ants evolved distinct division of labor within the worker caste , with small , medium , and large workers and specialized soldiers ( the latter only in Atta ) ( Weber , 1966 ) ; and 5 . the crown group of the attine ants underwent significant changes in their gut microbiota that likely facilitated the conversion efficiency of fungal diet substrate into ant biomass ( Sapountzis et al . , 2015; Sapountzis et al . , 2019 ) . While these advances have significantly enriched our understanding of the spectacular biology of the attine ants in general and the leaf-cutting ants in particular , very few studies have addressed the molecular synergy mechanisms that were decisive for integrating the complementary innovations of the ants and their cultivars . Recent genome sequencing showed that cultivars likely changed their chitinase processing abilities in co-evolution with the ants’ labial glands ( Nygaard et al . , 2016 ) , but the clearest and most detailed evidence of functional physiological complementarity has been found for the digestive enzymes of the mutualistic farming symbiosis . These insights were initiated by pioneering work by Michael M . Martin ( Boyd and Martin , 1975b; Boyd and Martin , 1975a; Martin and Martin , 1971; Martin and Martin , 1971 ) , which suggested that proteases in the fecal fluid of Atta leaf-cutting ants had actually been produced by the fungal symbiont and passed unharmed through the ant guts to mediate protein degradation of the plant forage material when it was mixed with fecal fluid . Our previous work not only confirmed this hypothesis for Acromyrmex leaf-cutting ants ( Kooij et al . , 2014b ) , but also expanded the list of cultivar-derived fecal fluid proteins to include pectinases , hemicellulases , and laccases ( Rønhede et al . , 2004; Schiøtt et al . , 2010; De Fine Licht et al . , 2013; Kooij et al . , 2016 ) . These studies also showed that all these enzymes are produced in the specialized gongylidia of the fungal cultivar that the ants ingest as their almost exclusive food source ( Schiøtt et al . , 2010; De Fine Licht et al . , 2013; Kooij et al . , 2014b; Kooij et al . , 2016 ) . While these recent studies generalized Martin’s findings across the two leaf-cutting ant genera and for multiple groups of enzymes , they left a number of deeper questions regarding the symbiotic decomposition process unanswered . First , the degradation of leaf fragments in Acromyrmex fungus gardens proceeds very efficiently , as ant-produced pellets of chewed leaf material deposited on top of the garden turn black within a few hours to then be spread out over the garden by the ants . Second , the fungal cultivar has lost a major ligninase domain ( Nygaard et al . , 2016 ) , raising the question how these recalcitrant ( difficult-to-degrade ) cell wall components are breached to allow fungal hyphae access to the nutritious interior of live plant cells . To address what processes we might have missed , the present study focused on obtaining a full proteome of the fecal fluid of the leaf-cutting ant Acromyrmex echinatior , extending the earlier partial proteome from 33 to 101 identified proteins ( Schiøtt et al . , 2010 ) . This revealed a surprisingly high proportion of oxidoreductases , which made us conjecture that the mutualistic ant and fungal partners might jointly realize aggressive biomass conversion via the inorganic Fenton reaction , which produces hydroxyl radicals that can break down lignocellulose . We thus set up a series of experiments to investigate whether Fenton chemistry indeed takes place when fecal fluid interacts with chewed leaf fragments concentrated in the ca . 3 mm diameter pellets that the ants construct . We confirmed our basic hypothesis and also found other enzymatic and iron components of the fecal fluid participating in the recycling of Fenton chemistry reactants . The synergistic process of enzymatic and inorganic chemistry appears to sustain a continuous production of hydroxyl radicals until the ants terminate the process . They do that by dismantling their Fenton bioconversion pellets to offer the pre-digested plant substrate to the fungal hyphae as small fragments and seemingly without any collateral damage to ant or fungal tissues due to uncontrolled hydroxyl radicals . 2 Results Our proteomic analysis of worker fecal fluid from four different A . echinatior colonies identified 174 proteins ( Supplementary file 1 ) , which showed substantial overlap among the pooled colony-specific samples ( Figure 1A ) . To avoid including spurious proteins , we restricted our analyses to a shortlist of 101 proteins present in at least three of the four colony samples , and we were able to annotate 91 ( 90% ) of these proteins ( Table 1 ) . This core proteome consisted mainly of degradation enzymes belonging to five major functional categories: oxidoreductases , proteolytic enzymes , carbohydrate active enzymes ( CAZymes ) , phosphate-liberating enzymes , and lipid degrading enzymes ( lipidolytic enzymes ) ( Figure 1B ) . Of the 10 remaining proteins , only three could not be functionally annotated . The vast majority ( 86 ) of the core fecal proteome originated from the fungal symbiont , with only 15 being encoded by the ant genome . Based on the number of spectra obtained for each identified protein , MaxQuant produced an approximate measure of relative abundance of each protein called label-free quantification intensity ( LFQ intensity ) ( Table 1 ) . This revealed that lipidolytic enzymes constitute only a very small fraction and that the proteins in the ‘miscellaneous’ category collectively had a moderate representation although some of these proteins had high abundance . The four remaining categories had summed LFQ intensities of the same order of magnitude ( Figure 1B ) and two specific proteins stood out as being exceptionally abundant ( Supplementary file 1 ) , the Alkaline phosphatase ( Protein ID 75 in Table 1 ) and the previously described Laccase LgLcc1 ( Protein ID 97 in Table 1; De Fine Licht et al . , 2013 ) , which jointly made up almost a quarter of the total fecal protein mass . Three other proteins also showed remarkably high LFQ-abundance levels: a 1 , 3-beta-glucanase ( Protein ID 88 in Table 1 ) , a Metallopeptidase M35 ( Protein ID 206 in Table 1 ) , and a Serine protease S53 ( Protein ID 64 in Table 1 ) , which implies that the five most abundant proteins contributed more than 40% of the total fecal protein mass . These results confirmed our previous findings that a large proportion of the fecal fluid proteins consists of proteases ( Kooij et al . , 2014b ) , pectinases ( Schiøtt et al . , 2010 ) , hemicellulases ( Kooij et al . , 2016 ) , and laccases ( De Fine Licht et al . , 2013 ) , but we now also identified several phosphate-liberating and lipidolytic enzymes . Five of the identified oxidoreductases were annotated as fungal glucose-methanol-choline ( GMC ) oxidoreductases . A subgroup of these enzymes are the aryl alcohol oxidases that are believed to play an important role in lignin degradation by brown-rot fungi ( Guillén et al . , 2000 ) . This category of wood degrading fungi is distinct from the white-rot fungi , which degrade lignin using ligninolytic peroxidases ( Arantes et al . , 2012; Arantes and Goodell , 2014 ) . The latter mechanism has most likely evolved only once in the Agaricomycotina lineage ( to which Leucocoprinus belongs ) , but has subsequently been lost many times giving a complex phylogenetic pattern ( Floudas et al . , 2012 ) . We showed previously ( Nygaard et al . , 2016 ) that the leaf-cutting ant cultivar has lost its ligninolytic peroxidases , so their decomposition spectrum would functionally be more reminiscent of brown-rot fungi than white-rot fungi although they are not wood degrading fungi and are thus not formally covered by this terminology . Assuming that convergent adaptation could have taken place in the Leucocoprinus symbiont , we thus pursued the pathways that could enable the Fenton reaction in more detail . In order to break down lignocellulose , brown-rot fungi produce aromatic alcohols , which are subsequently oxidized by aryl alcohol oxidases to produce hydrogen peroxide ( H2O2 ) . The hydrogen peroxide is subsequently used in a Fenton reaction in which reduced iron ( Fe2+ ) reacts with hydrogen peroxide to produce hydroxyl radicals that can diffuse into the lignocellulose substrate and break the chemical bonds responsible for the rigid structure of lignocellulose . This in turn will loosen the cell walls and allow access for more bulky degradation enzymes to target specific components of the plant cell walls . Unless the oxidized iron ( Fe3+ ) is recycled by reduction to Fe2+ , the production of reactive oxygen species will end when all Fe2+ has been used . It has therefore been suggested that fungi secrete secondary metabolites such as hydroquinones to reduce Fe3+ to Fe2+ ( Suzuki et al . , 2006 ) . In spite of the decomposition potential of the Fenton reaction , it remains a major challenge for any living tissues to be exposed to concentrated doses of free radicals . Numerous adaptations have in fact evolved to remove low concentrations of free radicals from living tissues ( Matés et al . , 1999 ) , so we conjectured that attine ants should have found ways to avoid such damage in case they would use Fenton chemistry . Against this background knowledge from brown-rot fungi , we drew up a hypothetical scenario ( Figure 2 ) that might allow the leaf-cutting ant symbiotic partnership to use Fenton chemistry , to sustain and control that reaction according to need , and to have it take place in a spatial setting where collateral damage to living tissues would be avoided . As it appears , the spatial issue appears to have been resolved because Acromyrmex colonies concentrate their chewed leaf fragments in pellets of ca . 3 mm diameter at the top of their fungus gardens for some hours before the material is dispersed across the actively growing ridges of the fungal mycelium mass . However , if these pellets would be the optimal location for a sustained Fenton reaction , the symbiotic partnership would have been required to also evolve a fecal fluid enzyme that reduces Fe3+ while decomposing degradation products from the plant substrate . We hypothesized that glucose dehydrogenase ( Protein ID 145 in Table 1 ) , the most abundant ant-encoded fecal fluid protein ( Table 1 , Supplementary file 1 ) , could have this function using glucose as electron donor to reduce Fe3+ , either directly or indirectly via an intermediate redox compound ( Figure 2 ) . We therefore set up a number of biochemical assays to test the proposed scenario and report the results below . A phylogenetic tree of all five fungal GMC oxidoreductases isolated from fecal fluid , together with representative GMC oxidoreductases from various basidiomycete fungi , showed that these five enzymes clustered within the aryl alcohol oxidases ( Figure 3 ) , while being distinct from the four other known functional groups ( glucose oxidases , methanol oxidases , pyranose 2-oxidases , and cellulose dehydrogenases ) ( Ferreira et al . , 2015 ) . We subsequently measured the amount of hydrogen peroxide that these GMC oxidoreductases produce with and without substrates , which showed that fecal fluid contained a substantial amount of hydrogen peroxide . Addition of aromatic veratryl alcohol further increased this amount , whereas glucose and methanol did not have any effect ( Figure 4A ) , confirming the presence of aryl alcohol oxidases in the fecal fluid . As an extra control assay to check that the increase in absorbance was directly caused by hydrogen peroxide , we added the enzyme catalase , which is a very effective and specific hydrogen peroxide degrading enzyme . As expected , catalase completely removed the signal , confirming that hydrogen peroxide is indeed naturally produced in fecal fluid ( Figure 4A ) . Two other fecal fluid oxidoreductases ( Protein IDs 81 and 186 in Table 1 ) were annotated as copper radical oxidases with close similarity to glyoxal oxidases . These enzymes may also produce hydrogen peroxide , using the small organic compound glyoxal and other aldehydes as substrate ( Daou and Faulds , 2017 ) . Experimental addition of glyoxal to fecal fluid of Acromyrmex worker did indeed increase the amount of hydrogen peroxide , confirming that glyoxal oxidases are also present in the fecal fluid ( Figure 4A ) . For the Fenton reaction to take place , the produced hydrogen peroxide must react with Fe2+ atoms . Brown-rot fungi are believed to be able to actively increase the concentration of iron atoms in their wood substrate for this purpose ( Kirker et al . , 2017 ) , but such a mechanism would not be applicable to the fecal fluid Fenton reaction since it is separated from the fungal hyphae . To be viable , this reaction must therefore rely on iron present in the leaf material collected by the ant workers and in the fecal fluid itself . Making fungal iron available would be adaptive for the ant farming symbiosis as a whole because direct use of iron from live plant tissues might well be constrained because plants also produce iron chelator compounds to inhibit the growth of plant pathogens ( Dellagi et al . , 2005 ) . We measured the iron levels in fecal fluid and found an average ( ± SD ) level of 370 ± 110 µM iron across six ant colonies . This concentration of iron should be sufficient to allow the Fenton reaction to occur ( Hegnar et al . , 2019; Elias and Waterhouse , 2010 ) . It corresponds to the levels relevant for natural wood degrading systems ( Hegnar et al . , 2019 ) although it is one to two orders of magnitude lower than the levels typically used for pretreatment of plant biomass in vitro ( Jung et al . , 2015 ) . However , in such human bioconversion experiments , oxidized iron is not recycled into reduced iron , which means that the pool of useable iron is continuously decreasing and therefore needs a high starting concentration . In living systems there are limits to how much iron can be accumulated without posing a risk for unintended oxidation of organic compounds . Natural selection producing a system for iron recycling could thus be highly adaptive . The hydroxyl radicals that Fenton chemistry should produce can be measured via their ability to break down 2-deoxy-D-ribose into thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances ( TBARS ) ( Halliwell et al . , 1988 ) . To quantify this effect , we adapted the standard 2-deoxy-D-ribose assay to accommodate the small volumes of fecal fluid that could practically be collected directly from the ants and found pronounced amounts of hydroxyl radicals to be present in the ant fecal fluid ( Figure 4B ) . Adding a strong metal chelator 1 , 10-phenanthroline caused a significant reduction in absorbance . This is consistent with the hydroxyl radicals being produced by Fenton chemistry because the Fenton reaction is known to be inhibited by 1 , 10-phenanthroline’s strong iron sequestering activity ( Winterbourn , 1995 ) . This effect was not observed when only the solvent of the 1 , 10-phenanthroline chemical ( methanol ) was added . The Fenton reaction can only proceed as long as there are Fe2+ atoms present to be converted to Fe3+ atoms , and brown-rot fungi are believed to maintain their Fenton reactions via enzyme systems that convert Fe3+ back to Fe2+ ( Guillén et al . , 2000; Arantes et al . , 2012 ) . A similar mechanism would not work for the initial stages of leaf degradation in the fungus garden , as the mycelium is separated from the Fenton pellets . We therefore conjectured that the ant-encoded glucose dehydrogenase identified in the fecal fluid proteome could mediate the reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ using glucose as electron donor . We indeed found a measurable capacity for Fe3+ reduction in fecal fluid , which was further increased by the addition of glucose . This was consistent with Fe3+ being actively recycled into Fe2+ via fecal fluid compounds and with glucose dehydrogenase most likely being responsible for at least part of this activity ( Figure 4C ) . An alternative pathway for Fe3+ reduction is mediated by laccase ( Guillén et al . , 2000 ) , which was also found in high quantities in the fecal fluid . Preliminary experiments using laccase substrates in these assays did , however , not change the rate of Fe3+ reduction . This makes it less likely that laccase plays a role in this process , although more elaborate experimentation will be needed in order to rule out this possibility . 3 Discussion The presence of fungal enzymes in the fecal fluid of leaf-cutting ants was suggested already in the 1970s based on the biochemical similarity of proteases in fecal fluid and the fungal cultivar ( Boyd and Martin , 1975b; Boyd and Martin , 1975a ) . We achieved increasing confirmation of this idea in a series of previous studies ( Schiøtt et al . , 2010; Kooij et al . , 2014b; De Fine Licht et al . , 2013; Kooij et al . , 2016 ) , but our present study presents the first overall proteome that is complete enough to allow inferences of hitherto unknown chemical processes . The comprehensive list of A . echinatior fecal fluid proteins that we obtained ( Supplementary file 1 ) was now also sufficiently replicated to confirm that the large majority of the identified proteins are fungal in origin and serve the farming symbiosis after being deposited on new plant substrate via the ant fecal fluid . When run on SDS-Page gels ( Schiøtt et al . , 2010 ) , the fecal fluid proteins always gave the same banding pattern , rejecting the null hypothesis that they are a random collection of proteins that happen to escape digestion . Overall , 101 of the 174 identified proteins were found in at least three fecal fluid samples from different ant colonies , and for many of them we were able to measure the corresponding enzymatic activity using biochemical assays ( this study and Schiøtt et al . , 2010; De Fine Licht et al . , 2013; Kooij et al . , 2014b; Kooij et al . , 2016 ) . These results strongly suggest that most if not all of the fecal proteins have condition-dependent adaptive significance , have been selected to avoid degradation in the digestive system of the ants , and serve the efficiency of the entire symbiosis between farming ants and fungal cultivars . While many of the enzyme activities found in the ant fecal fluid have been discussed in previous publications , the roles of phosphate-liberating enzymes and lipidolytic enzymes have not . Just like nitrogen and carbon , phosphorus is a major macronutrient required for many biological processes . Enzymatic degradation of organic matter to liberate C , N , and P is known to take place in a stoichiometrically balanced way ( Sinsabaugh et al . , 2009 ) , so it is not surprising that the fecal fluid also contains a range of enzymes able to release phosphorus from various substrates . That alkaline phosphatase ( Protein ID 75 in Table 1 ) had the highest abundance of all fecal proteins underlines the importance of phosphorus mineralization . Several enzymes able to release phosphorus from phytin were also present . Phytin is a phosphorus-storage compound in plant seeds , but also occurs in pollen and vegetative tissues ( Brinch-Pedersen et al . , 2002 ) . Laboratory colonies of A . echinatior were occasionally fed with dry rice grains , but in nature leaf-cutting ants are not known to forage on seeds to any significant degree ( Kooij et al . , 2014a ) . However , they do harvest flowers , whose pollen may be a source of phytin . Finally , the fecal fluid contained ribonucleases that will degrade RNA , another major source of phosphorus . The fecal lipidolytic enzymes had low abundances overall . Apart from digesting lipids into assimilatory products , these enzymes may also hplay a function in degrading cell membranes to liberate cytosolic compounds as has been shown for biotrophic fungi ( Ghannoum , 2000 ) . They may also interfere with signal transduction pathways involved in plant resistance toward pathogens ( Wu and Li , 2015 ) , but all these putative functions require that the plant substrate is alive for a while after having been fragmented and placed in the fungus garden , which may well be the case . The key compounds hypothesized to be involved in inorganic Fenton chemistry ( GMC oxidoreductases , hydrogen peroxide , high concentrations of iron , and glucose dehydrogenase ) were always found in all four colonies for which we investigated fecal fluid samples . Compared to white-rot fungi , brown-rot fungi are believed to have a reduced array of enzymes targeting lignocellulose , and to specifically lack lignin peroxidases , which is also the case for L . gongylophorus ( Nygaard et al . , 2016 ) . Brown-rot fungi compensate this lack of enzymatic potential by using Fenton chemistry to degrade lignocellulose while producing extracellular hydroxyl radicals ( Arantes and Goodell , 2014 ) . In the Fenton reaction , hydrogen peroxide reacts with ferrous iron ( Fe2+ ) and hydrogen ions to produce ferric iron ( Fe3+ ) , water , and hydroxyl radicals ( Guillén et al . , 2000; Arantes et al . , 2012 ) . The very reactive hydroxyl radicals produced in these free-living fungi are known to damage a wide range of biomolecules ( Halliwell et al . , 1988 ) . Their putative functions are: 1 . to release soluble carbohydrate fragments from plant cell walls ( Schweikert et al . , 2002 ) and 2 . to reduce the viscosity of solutions containing plant cell wall components such as xyloglucan , pectin , and cellulose ( Fry , 1998 ) , as expected when degradation of these polysaccharides has taken place . The small size of hydroxyl radical molecules allows them to initiate penetration and cleavage of lignin , cellulose , and hemicellulose polymers in preparation for further degradation into assimilatory monomers by specific enzymes ( Arantes et al . , 2012 ) . Brown-rot fungi are believed to use GMC oxidoreductases or copper radical oxidases to aerobically oxidize fungal alcohols or aldehydes in order to produce hydrogen peroxide . In this process they then obtain the required iron from the wood substrate ( Arantes et al . , 2012 ) or via actively mycelial transport into the degrading wood ( Kirker et al . , 2017 ) . It has been suggested that fungal laccases are then oxidizing hydroquinones into the semiquinones that react with ferric iron ( Fe3+ ) to produce quinones and ferrous iron ( Fe2+ ) , which would produce the recycling process needed to maintain the Fenton reaction over time ( Guillén et al . , 2000 ) . It is intriguing that the details of Fenton chemistry in brown-rot fungi have remained rather little known in spite of the economic importance of these fungi ( Arantes and Goodell , 2014 ) , and that the leaf-cutting ants offered an unexpected window for understanding this elusive process . The laccases , GMC oxidoreductases , and copper radical oxidases were similarly found in high quantities in the fecal fluid of Acromyrmex leaf-cutting ants , consistent with Fenton chemistry being a standard procedure in this fungus-farming symbiosis to degrade plant cell walls and/or toxic secondary plant polymers meant to deter herbivores ( Figure 2 ) . We could verify that the identified GMC oxidoreductases were aryl alcohol oxidases ( Figure 3 ) , which are known to produce hydrogen peroxide from aromatic alcohols . We also verified that fecal fluid contains concentrated hydrogen peroxide and that the concentration increased further after adding veratryl alcohol or glyoxal , which are substrates for GMC oxidoreductases and copper radical oxidases , respectively ( Guillén et al . , 1992; Daou and Faulds , 2017 ) . We further documented that the iron content of the fecal fluid is maintained at levels that are amply permissive for Fenton chemistry to occur . Also the acid pH of ca . 4 in the fecal fluid should be ideal for Fenton chemistry ( Bishop et al . , 1968; Erthal et al . , 2004 ) although we cannot be sure this is the ambient pH because the plant material might also influence the final pH in the substrate pellet . Finally , a separate assay showed that fecal fluid components degrade deoxyribose into thiobarbituric acid-active products , which can only be explained by the presence of hydroxyl radicals ( Halliwell et al . , 1988 ) . To obtain more direct evidence for the produced hydroxyl radicals contributing to plant substrate breakdown , future research should focus on using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to analyze plant cell wall preparations subjected to fecal fluid degradation , a type of analytical chemistry that was beyond the scope of the present study . Without such validation , we cannot rule out other possible functions of these radicals such as general sanitation of the plant substrate . However , such alternative function has never been conjectured or shown for the ant fecal fluid , whereas brown-rot fungi are widely believed to use hydroxyl radicals for substrate degradation ( Arantes and Goodell , 2014 ) . We also note that specialized functions of the ant fecal fluid aimed at plant substrate degradation are uncontroversial ( Boyd and Martin , 1975b; Boyd and Martin , 1975a; Martin and Martin , 1971; Kooij et al . , 2014b; Rønhede et al . , 2004; Schiøtt et al . , 2010; De Fine Licht et al . , 2013; Kooij et al . , 2016 ) . Our Fenton chemistry scenario is therefore supported by consistent inferential evidence , but in need of further experimental validation . The high concentrations of laccase LgLcc1 ( Protein ID 97 in Table 1 ) in the ant fecal fluid suggest a similar mechanism for maintaining reliable conversion of Fe3+ back to Fe2+ ( using hydroquinone as an electron donor ) as the Fenton chemistry known from brown-rot fungi ( Guillén et al . , 2000 ) . However , the glucose dehydrogenase ( Protein ID 145 in Table 1 ) encoded by the ant genome was also abundant in the fecal proteome and could convert Fe3+ back to Fe2+ via simultaneous oxidization of glucose . We verified this putative function as likely with a Ferrozine-based assay ( Goodell et al . , 2006 ) , including its dependence on glucose availability . Interestingly , however , preliminary experiments indicated that adding laccase substrates did not influence the velocity of this reaction , which suggests that glucose liberated from the plant polysaccharides is primarily used to keep the Fenton reaction going . This substrate dependence may provide an additional feedback loop for the farming symbiotic partnership to control the inorganic Fenton chemistry process . The ant-derived glucose dehydrogenase ( Protein ID 145 in Table 1 ) alternative might allow the ants to also use the fungal laccases specifically for the decomposition of secondary plant compounds as found in one of our previous studies ( De Fine Licht et al . , 2013 ) . That study also suggested that LgLcc1 ( Protein ID 97 in Table 1 ) came under positive selection in the common ancestor of the leaf-cutting ants , which would be consistent with laccase becoming redundant for iron reduction and therefore undergoing directional selection for other functions . The assembly of complementary components from different sources implies that the fungal cultivar and the farming ants synergistically cooperate to accomplish the continued production of hydroxyl radicals , but only as long as Fenton chemistry is needed . The ants do not appear to keep adding fecal fluid to existing Fenton pellets and they take them apart when they have turned black after some hours to distribute the Fenton exposed leaf fragments over the actively growing ridges of the fungus garden where fungal decomposition takes over . Both the processing efficiency and the ultimate behavioral control by the ants strongly suggest refined co-adaptation at the molecular level to enable colonies to operate as integrated functional herbivores . An earlier study found a high expression of an NADH-quinone oxidoreductase in fungus gardens of A . echinatior ( Grell et al . , 2013 ) , an enzyme converting quinones to hydroquinones that can react with Fe3+ to form Fe2+ after conversion to semiquinones by laccase . This is consistent with the ant encoded glucose dehydrogenase being relevant only for the degradation process in the Fenton pellets , and with NADH-quinone oxidoreductases taking over after the leaf fragments have been dispersed over the garden and the fungal hyphae decompose what remains of the substrate . Aryl alcohol oxidases use aromatic alcohols as a substrate to produce hydrogen peroxide . White-rot fungi produce aromatic veratryl alcohol as a secondary metabolite , which plays several important roles for ligninolysis ( Jensen et al . , 1994 ) . Veratryl alcohol is derived from phenylalanine via the phenylalanine/tyrosine pathway that has previously been shown to be upregulated in the gongylidia of the A . echinatior cultivar L . gongylophorus ( De Fine Licht et al . , 2014 ) . This might suggest that veratryl alcohol ( or a derivative thereof ) is produced in the gongylidia of the fungal cultivar to be ingested but not digested by the ants so it can function in the fecal fluid to facilitate the initial stages of substrate degradation . The hydrogen peroxide needed in the Fenton reaction may also be derived from the activity of the glyoxal oxidases that we identified , which use various aldehydes as substrate for hydrogen peroxide production ( Daou and Faulds , 2017 ) . Such aldehydes could then either originate from the oxidized aryl alcohols produced by the aryl alcohol oxidases , or could be direct degradation products from plant cell wall components ( Daou and Faulds , 2017 ) . These multiple parallel pathways suggest that the co-evolved interactions between inorganic Fenton chemistry and organic enzyme functions are likely to have robust operational functionality under a variety of environmental ( i . e . substrate ) conditions . Finally , as we explained in the introduction , it is important to note that hydroxyl radicals are highly toxic also for the organisms producing them . This probably constrains the use of naturally produced hydroxyl radicals for biomass degradation unless the Fenton chemistry producing these radicals remains distal to hyphal growth and is terminated by the time hyphae grow into the substrate patches pre-treated in this manner . This complication will slow down the rate of decomposition in free-living fungi , but the leaf-cutting ant symbiotic partnership appears to have resolved this constraint by compartmentalizing the complementary elements of initial aggressive break down of plant substrate . Although the necessary compounds for the Fenton reaction are all present in the guts of the ants , the low oxygen pressure there would presumably prevent the production of hydrogen peroxide inside the ants and thereby any collateral damage to ant tissues . Defecation onto concentrated pellets of chewed leaf fragments thus ensures that the reaction does not start until atmospheric oxygen is available . Consequently , the Fenton pellets appear to function as small bioconversion reactors that are spatially isolated from both the fungal and the ant tissues so that potentially harmful side-effects are avoided . Also in this respect robustness against potential malfunction appears to have evolved . Our recent genome sequencing study of Acromyrmex ants and their cultivars revealed that A . echinatior has more glutathione S-transferase genes than other ( non-attine ) ants , despite having fewer detoxification genes in general ( Nygaard et al . , 2011 ) . Glutathione S-transferase is known to be involved in the breakdown of oxidized lipids , which would likely be produced if reactive oxygen species would be formed in the gut and react with the lipid cell membranes of the gut tissues . This suggests that physiological mechanisms to ameliorate inadvertent damage caused by hydroxyl radicals may be in place , should they appear in the ant gut before the excretion of fecal fluid . The extent to which cellulose is degraded in the fungus garden has been widely disputed ( see Grell et al . , 2013 and references therein ) . It is noteworthy that the fecal fluid proteome only contained a single 1 , 4-beta-glucanase ( Protein ID 55 in Table 1 ) to target the cellulose backbone , and that this protein was found in low quantities and in only three of the four examined colonies . We also found a single 1 , 4-beta-glucosidase ( Protein ID 73 in Table 1 ) that releases glucose moieties from cellobiose and oligosaccharides , but this enzyme is also targeting hemicellulose in addition to cellulose . Finally , effective degradation of cellulose normally requires the enzyme cellobiohydrolase , which was only found in one colony in very low quantities ( Supplementary file 1 ) . These findings are consistent with our earlier inference ( Grell et al . , 2013; Moller et al . , 2011 ) that cellulose degradation is not a primary function of the fecal fluid , supporting earlier findings that recalcitrant plant cell wall cellulose is not degraded to a significant degree in Acromyrmex fungus gardens , but discarded from the colony as waste ( Moller et al . , 2011 ) . Our finding that Fenton chemistry may be used for breaking chemical bonds in cell wall lignocellulose and is likely sufficient to give hyphal degradation enzymes access to their target substrates in the interior of plant cells , appears to corroborate this notion . More complete cellulose degradation would release an excess of assimilatory sugars for the fungal symbiont but without simultaneously providing nitrogen or phosphorus , which are the limiting factors for growth in any functional herbivore ( Elser et al . , 2007 ) . Such sugars could well be a burden for the symbiosis if they would allow inadvertent microorganisms to thrive in fungus gardens ( Grell et al . , 2013 ) . While the documentation of Fenton chemistry substantially increases our understanding of the way in which Acromyrmex leaf-cutting ants could become crop pests by robust functional herbivory , it is intriguing that we have never observed Fenton pellets in any of the Atta colonies that we have maintained in the lab for ca . 25 years . This suggests that the colonies of this other genus of leaf-cutting ants , which are approximately two orders of magnitude larger in size and considerably more damaging as agricultural pests have evolved alternative mechanisms to boost the efficiency and robustness of their functional herbivory . Given that also Atta colonies produce enormous amounts of cellulose rich waste , we do not expect that the explanation for Atta’s success as functional herbivores will be fundamentally different . This is because both genera rear very closely related lineages of the L . gongylophorus cultivars in sympatry at our Panamanian sampling site ( Kooij et al . , 2015b ) and across their Latin American distributions ( Silva-Pinhati et al . , 2004 ) . We suspect therefore that obtaining a fecal fluid proteome of Atta might shed interesting light on whether these ants can also use forms of inorganic chemistry , or whether they rely on an enzymatic innovation not available in Acromyrmex . Another point of interest is that human in vitro experiments with Fenton chemistry have produced up to fivefold increases in the production of sugars from feedstock , although the efficiency remains highly dependent on the plant material used ( Kato et al . , 2014; Jung et al . , 2015; Hegnar et al . , 2019 ) . A major challenge in these human bioconversion applications has been that the Fenton generated reactive oxygen species degrade the very enzymes that are instrumental in maintaining sustainable conversion efficiency . An interesting venue for further research is therefore to elucidate how Acromyrmex fecal fluid degradation enzymes avoid being harmed by the hydroxyl radicals that accompany them . Finally , we are used to think of our own crops as being in continuous need of manure to boost nutrient availability and growth . The term manure now seems inappropriate for attine ant fecal fluid even though deposition of fecal droplets in the fungus garden seems to suggests this analogy . In retrospect , abandoning this term seems logical , because the ants rear a heterotrophic crop and it seems hard to imagine how fresh leaf substrate can be further enriched with nutrients . Our present results suggest that it is also ambiguous to use the term ‘fecal’ for the droplets that leave the hindguts of leaf-cutting ants . In a structural sense this is fecal material , but in a functional sense this fluid now seems to be analogous to a joint symbiotic circulation system tinkered together by natural selection over millions of years . The primary function of this higher-order circulation system appears to be optimizing the distribution of gongylidia-produced decomposition compounds to maintain the combined superorganismal body of ants , ant brood , and fungus garden . In this perspective , it also becomes ambiguous which partner is the farmer or the crop , because the relationship is symmetrical in its mutual dependence and the cultivar has remarkable agency even though it neither has brains to coordinate or legs to move around . This perspective is worked out in more detail elsewhere ( Boomsma , 2022 ) and suggests that we need to be careful in applying anthropomorphic language to naturally evolved symbioses outside the human domain . 4 Materials and methods Colonies of Acromyrmex echinatior ( numbers Ae150 , Ae160 , Ae263 , Ae322 , Ae356 , Ae372 , Ae480 , and Ae490 ) were collected in Gamboa , Panama between 2001 and 2010 and maintained in the laboratory at ca . 25°C and ca . 70% relative humidity ( Bot and Boomsma , 1996 ) where they were supplied with a diet of bramble leaves , occasional dry rice , and pieces of apple . Fecal droplets were collected by squeezing large worker ants with forceps on the head and abdomen until they deposited a drop of fecal fluid . For mass spectrometry , 0 . 5 µl of double distilled and autoclaved water was added to the droplet before it was collected with a micro pipette and transferred to an Eppendorf tube with Run Blue loading buffer ( Expedeon Inc ) . For the iron assay , Fenton reaction assay , hydrogen peroxide assay , and iron reduction assay , the fecal droplets were deposited on parafilm and collected undiluted with a 5 µl glass capillary . Ten fecal droplets from each of the four colonies were run on a 12% Run Blue polyacrylamide gel ( Expedeon Inc ) in a Mini-Protean II electrophoresis system ( Biorad ) for about 10 min at 90 mA . The gel was stained in Instant Blue Coomassie ( Expedeon Inc ) overnight at room temperature . The stained part of each lane was then cut out with a scalpel and transferred to Eppendorf tubes , after which the samples were sent to Alphalyse ( Denmark ) for analysis . The protein samples were reduced and alkylated with iodoacetamide ( i . e . carbamidomethylated ) and subsequently digested with trypsin . The resulting peptides were concentrated by Speed Vac lyophilization and redissolved for injection on a Dionex nano-LC system and MS/MS analysis on a Bruker Maxis Impact QTOF instrument . The obtained MS/MS spectra were analyzed using the MaxQuant software package version 1 . 5 . 4 . 1 ( Cox and Mann , 2008 ) integrated with the Andromeda search engine ( Cox et al . , 2011 ) using standard parameters . The spectra were matched to a reference database of the predicted Acromyrmex echinatior proteome ( Nygaard et al . , 2011 ) combined with published predicted Leucocoprinus gongylophorus proteomes originating from the Acromyrmex echinatior , Atta cephalotes , and Atta colombica fungal symbionts ( Aylward et al . , 2013; Nygaard et al . , 2011; Nygaard et al . , 2016 ) , as well as single protein sequences predicted from manually PCR amplified and sequenced cDNA sequences ( Schiøtt et al . , 2010; De Fine Licht et al . , 2013; Kooij et al . , 2016; Kooij et al . , 2014b; Schiøtt et al . , 2008 ) . As these published fungal proteomes contained many redundant protein sequences , a non-redundant reference protein database was constructed using CD-Hit ( RRID:SCR_007105 ) ( Li and Godzik , 2006 ) keeping only the longest sequences of the sets of 100% matching sequences . Annotation of the identified protein sequences was performed using Blast2GO ( RRID:SCR_005828 ) ( Hegnar et al . , 2019 ) combined with manual BlastP searches against the NCBI nr database . Fecal fluid iron content was measured according to Fish , 1988 . Fecal fluid from 20 workers from each of six colonies ( Ae150 , Ae160 , Ae263 , Ae356 , Ae480 , and Ae490 ) was collected with glass capillaries and weighed in 0 . 2 ml PCR tubes to determine the volume of each sample , assuming a density of 1 g/ml . The samples were diluted to 100 µl with 0 . 1 M HCl , mixed with Reagent A ( 0 . 142 M KMnO4 , 0 . 6 M HCl ) , and incubated for 2 hr at 60°C . Subsequently 10 µl Reagent B ( 6 . 5 mM Ferrozine , 13 . 1 mM neocuproine , 2 M ascorbic acid , 5 M ammonium acetate ) was added to each sample and incubated for 30 min at room temperature , after which 150 µl of this mixture was transferred to a microtiter plate and the absorbance at 562 nm measured in an Epoch microplate spectrophotometer ( BioTek ) . Samples with known amounts of iron were processed in parallel with the unknown samples to produce a standard curve from which the iron content of the unknown samples could be determined . Three series of standards were made from ferrous ethylenediammonium sulfate tetrahydrate , ferrous sulfate heptahydrate , and ferric chloride hexahydrate . In all cases a solution of 5 mg/l iron in 0 . 1 M HCl was used to make a dilution series ranging from 78 . 1 µg/l to 5 mg/l . In addition , a blank sample without iron was included and used to correct for background absorbance . 0 . 5 µl fecal fluid from each of the colonies Ae150 , Ae160 , Ae263 , Ae356 , Ae480 , and Ae490 was diluted with 0 . 5 µl distilled H2O and mixed with either 1 µl H2O , 1 µl 40 mM 1 , 10-phenanthroline ( dissolved in methanol to 200 mM and diluted 1:4 with distilled H2O ) or 1 µl 20% methanol . After 15 min incubation at room temperature , 2 µl substrate ( 100 mM 2-deoxy-D-ribose in 0 . 1 M sodium acetate buffer pH 5 . 0 ) was added , and samples were incubated for 30 min at room temperature . Then , 4 µl of a solution of 1% 2-thiobarbituric acid in 50 mM NaOH was added followed by addition of 4 µl of 2 . 8% trichloroacetic acid . The samples were then incubated for 20 min at 99 . 9°C in a PCR machine , after which 2 µl was used for measuring the absorbance at 532 nm using a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer ( Halliwell et al . , 1988 ) . Control samples without addition of 2-deoxy-D-ribose were made in parallel and the absorbance value subtracted from the absorbance values of the samples . Similarly , control samples with 2-deoxy-D-ribose added but without fecal droplets were made in parallel so also their absorbance value could be subtracted from those of the samples . Control samples without both 2-deoxy-D-ribose and fecal droplets were also run in parallel and these absorbance values were added to the final values to compensate for subtracting the absorbance values of two controls from each sample value . 0 . 5 µl fecal fluid from each of the colonies Ae150 , Ae160 , Ae263 , Ae356 , Ae480 , and Ae490 was mixed with either 150 µl demineralized H2O or with 150 µl 10 mM glucose , 10 mM glyoxal , 10 mM veratryl alcohol , 10 mM methanol , or 100 U catalase . The samples were incubated for 60 min at 30°C in a PCR machine . To avoid direct oxidation of the amplex red substrate by laccases in the fecal fluid , the samples were transferred to Amicon Ultra-0 . 5 Centrifugal filters with 3 Kda membranes ( Merck Millipore UFC500396 ) and centrifuged at 14 , 000 g for 30 min . 100 µl flow through was transferred to a microtiter plate and 100 µl amplex red reagent ( 100 µM Ampliflu red , 2 U/ml horse radish peroxidase , in 0 . 1 M phosphate buffer pH 7 . 4 ) ( Zhou et al . , 1997 ) was added , after which the absorbance at 560 nm was measured for 30 min using an Epoch microplate spectrophotometer ( BioTek ) . This absorbance measure was then used to calculate the H2O2 concentration using a standard curve made from a twofold serial dilution of H2O2 ranging from 1 . 56 µM to 100 µM and including a blank sample without H2O2 . The standard samples were assayed in parallel with the fecal fluid samples . One microliter fecal fluid from each of the colonies Ae150 , Ae160 , Ae263 , Ae356 , Ae480 , and Ae490 was mixed with 71 µl demineralized H2O , 10 µl 1 mM FeCl3 · 6 H2O , 115 µl 0 . 1 M acetate buffer pH 4 . 4 , and either 23 µl H2O or 23 µl 100 mM glucose . Subsequently , 10 µl 1% FerroZine was added and the absorbance at 562 nM was measured during a 30 min period using an Epoch microplate spectrophotometer ( BioTek ) ( Goodell et al . , 2006 ) . The rates of change in absorbance from 5 to 30 min were used to calculate the amount of Fe3+ reduced to Fe2+ per minute , using a standard curve made from a twofold serial dilution of FeSO4 · NH3CH2CH2NH3SO4 · 4 H2O , ranging from 5 mM to 0 . 078 mM and including a blank sample without iron . The standard samples were assayed in parallel with the fecal fluid samples . All analyses were done in RStudio Version 0 . 99 . 491 ( RRID:SCR_000432 ) . Shapiro–Wilk tests were used to test whether differences in response variables between treatments within the same ant colonies followed a normal distribution . For hydrogen peroxide measurements a square root transformation of response data was applied to make the data pass the Shapiro–Wilk test . Planned comparisons between treatments were performed with paired t-tests ( by pairing measurements of samples coming from the same ant colonies ) . p-values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Holm–Bonferroni method . The five identified fecal fluid GMC oxidoreductase sequences were aligned with 15 basidiomycete GMC oxidoreductase sequences belonging to each of the five functional GMC oxidoreductase protein groups presented in Ferreira et al . , 2015 , using M-coffee ( http://tcoffee . crg . cat/apps/tcoffee/do:mcoffee ) with default parameter settings . The alignment file was then used in PhyML ( RRID:SCR_014629 ) with Smart Model Selection ( http://www . atgc-montpellier . fr/phyml-sms/ ) and aLRT SH-like support values . The best DNA substitution model turned out to be LG+G+I+F ."}
{"doi": "elife-14137-v1", "abstract": "Mood and anxiety disorders are the most prevalent psychiatric conditions and are exacerbated by stress . Recent studies have suggested cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) inhibition could represent a novel treatment approach or augmentation strategy for affective disorders including anxiety disorders and major depression . We show that traditional COX-2 inhibitors and a newly developed substrate-selective COX-2 inhibitor ( SSCI ) reduce a variety of stress-induced behavioral pathologies in mice . We found that these behavioral effects were associated with a dampening of neuronal excitability in the basolateral amygdala ( BLA ) ex vivo and in vivo , and were mediated by small-conductance calcium-activated potassium ( SK ) channel and CB1 cannabinoid receptor activation . Taken together , these data provide further support for the potential utility of SSCIs , as well as traditional COX-2 inhibitors , as novel treatment approaches for stress-related psychiatric disorders .", "plain language summary": "People may experience a stressful or traumatic event that can cause anxiety in their day-to-day lives . For some people , this anxiety can persist and develop into a disorder , such as posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) or acute stress disorder . Millions of people worldwide suffer from these disorders , but there are few classes of drug treatments currently available . Some preliminary studies in mice have suggested that anti-inflammatory drugs called cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) inhibitors may relieve symptoms of anxiety . COX-2 inhibitors target an enzyme called cyclooxygenase-2 , which is produced in many tissues throughout the body and brain . Some COX-2 inhibitors , such as Celebrex , are already widely used to treat arthritis . Studies in people have also suggested these drugs given in combination with antidepressants might also help people with depression , while a recently developed COX-2 inhibitor , called LM-4131 , stops the breakdown of chemicals produced in the brain that interact with the same brain receptors that marijuana does . In animal studies , this new drug reduced anxious behaviors . However , scientists didn’t know if the drug would also reduce anxious behaviors after animals were exposed to a traumatic or stressful experience . Now , Gamble-George et al . – including some of the same scientists that created LM-4131 – show this drug does reduce anxious behavior in mice after a traumatic or stressful experience . In the experiments , mice were stressed with an electric shock to their feet and then treated with LM-4131 , Celebrex , another COX-2 inhibitor sometimes used in humans , or an inactive control . The mice were then placed in new environments or mazes high off the ground that usually trigger anxious behavior . The mice treated with any of the three COX-2 inhibitors were less likely to act like they were anxious than the mice treated with the control solution . Gamble-George et al . then showed that LM-4131 changes how cells in the brain become excited in both isolated mouse brain cells and live mice . Short-term stress in humans is known to excite cells in an area of the brain called the amygdala , which controls how we respond to stress or trauma . The experiments showed that LM-4131 decreases this activity and decreases anxiety in stressed mice . Future animal and human studies are needed to confirm that COX-2 inhibitors are a useful treatment for stress disorders , and learn more about how they work .", "article": "1 Introduction Mood and anxiety disorders including major depression , generalized anxiety disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder are the most common psychiatric disorders ( Kessler et al . , 2005; 2012 ) . Unfortunately , current pharmacological therapies , which act primarily via monoamine reuptake mechanisms , are only partially effective ( Griebel and Holmes , 2013 ) . Recent studies have begun to emphasize novel non-monoaminergic pathophysiological mechanisms underlying mood and anxiety disorders and support immunological ( Miller et al . , 2009; Raison and Miller , 2013 ) , glutamatergic ( Abdallah et al . , 2015; Dutta et al . , 2015 ) , and bioactive lipid-based pharmacological approaches for treatment-resistant affective disorders ( Papakostas and Ionescu , 2015 ) . In this regard , there has been growing interest in cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) as a bioactive lipid-mechanism-based target for the treatment of affective disorders ( Akhondzadeh and Jafari , 2010; Fond et al . , 2014; Hermanson et al . , 2014 ) . COX-2 catalyzes synthesis of inflammatory prostaglandins ( PGs ) from free arachidonic acid and is expressed constitutively and in an activity-dependent manner in neurons ( Kaufmann et al . , 1996; Kulmacz and Lands , 1984; Yamagata et al . , 1993 ) . Based on the immune hyperactivity hypothesis of depression ( Felger and Miller , 2014; Haroon et al . , 2012; Miller et al . , 2009; Raison and Miller , 2013 ) , several clinical trials have demonstrated efficacy of COX-2 inhibition as an augmentation strategy to selective-serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) for the treatment of major depressive disorder ( MDD ) ( Akhondzadeh and Jafari , 2010; Akhondzadeh et al . , 2009; Muller et al . , 2006 ) . A number of preliminary studies also suggest that inhibition of COX-2 could have anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like behavioral effects in animal models . Specifically , chronic Celecoxib treatment prevents the development of anhedonia after chronic unpredictable stress ( Guo et al . , 2009 ) , and chronic COX-2 inhibition reduces immobilization stress-induced hypoactivity , memory deficits ( Kumari et al . , 2007 ) , and anxiety-like behavior in the mirror chamber test ( Dhir et al . , 2006 ) . Interestingly , in addition to generating PGs , COX-2 also metabolizes endogenous cannabinoids ( eCBs; anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol ) ( Kozak et al . , 2000; 2001 ) , and several eCB augmentation strategies , including inhibition of fatty acid amide hydrolase ( FAAH ) and monoacylglycerol lipase ( MAGL ) , have been found to attenuate anxiety- and depression-related behaviors ( Fu et al . , 2003; Griebel and Holmes , 2013; Gunduz-Cinar et al . , 2013; Hill et al . , 2009; Ruehle et al . , 2012 ) . However , little is currently understood about the possible contribution of eCB signaling to the behavioral and therapeutic actions of COX-2 inhibitors in mood and anxiety disorders . We have recently developed a class of COX-2 inhibitors that differentially inhibit COX-2 enzymatic activity based on the substrate: arachidonic acid or eCBs ( Duggan et al . , 2011; Hermanson et al . , 2013 ) . Specifically , these ‘substrate-selective COX-2 inhibitors’ ( SSCIs ) inhibit COX-2 activity when eCBs are used as substrates , without affecting the ability of COX-2 to generate PGs ( Hermanson et al . , 2013 ) . The development of these SSCIs provides a powerful tool for dissecting the mechanisms by which pharmacological COX-2 inhibition can modulate a variety of physiological and pathophysiological processes ( Hermanson et al . , 2014 ) . In the current study , we performed a comparative analysis between the prototypic SSCI , LM-4131 , and two traditional COX-2 inhibitors currently or previously approved for pain and arthritis , Lumiracoxib ( LMX ) and Celecoxib , in a variety of measures of mouse anxiety- , fear- and depression-related behavior . We show that all three COX-2 inhibitors attenuate stress-induced anxiety-like states , with minimal effects on basal anxiety-like , despair-like , and locomotor behaviors . The anxiolytic-like effects of LM-4131 were paralleled by a reduction in anxiety-related BLA neuronal activity ex vivo and in vivo . Collectively , these data support the therapeutic potential of COX-2 inhibition for the treatment of stress-related neuropsychiatric conditions . 2 Results We sought to determine the efficacy of pharmacological COX-2 inhibition in preclinical models of affective disorders . Since stress is the major environmental risk factor for the development of mood and anxiety disorders ( Caspi et al . , 2003; Kessler , 1997; McEwen , 2003 ) , we evaluated the behavioral effects of COX-2 inhibition after stress exposure . The novelty-induced hypophagia ( NIH ) assay is a well-validated ethologically relevant measure of both anxiety and depressive-related behaviors , encompassing both conflict anxiety and hedonic motivational processes , and is responsive to chronic ( but not acute ) SSRI treatment ( Cryan and Holmes , 2005; Dulawa and Hen , 2005; Merali et al . , 2003 ) . We utilized this assay to test the efficacy of a newly developed SSCI , LM-4131 , relative to two clinically effective COX-2 inhibitors , LMX and Celecoxib , to reduce basal and stress-induced anxiety-like behavior in mice . Results showed that systemic administration of either LM-4131 or LMX reduced mean feeding latency in ( 5–7 week old ) mice that had been subjected to foot-shock stress 8 or 24 , but not 4 or 72 , hours earlier ( Figure 1B–E ) . Celecoxib , tested at the 8-hr post-stress time point , also reduced mean feeding latency ( Figure 1C ) . In contrast , only LM-4131 , and not LMX or Celecoxib , produced a small reduction in mean feeding latency in non-stressed controls ( Figure 1A ) . It is interesting to note that the anxiety-like effect of foot-shock stress peaked at ~8 hr after foot-shock , and resolved by 72 hr . The delayed onset of the anxiety-like response to foot-shock may be related to time-dependent neuronal plasticity mechanism induced by the foot-shock exposure . Together , these data show that stress causes an increase in feeding latency between 8 and 24 hr , which was abrogated by the acute SSCI and the traditional COX-2 inhibitor treatment ( Figure 1F ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 14137 . 003Figure 1 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 14137 . 008 Demonstrating the generalizability of these effects across different subjects , stressor durations and drug treatment conditions , we showed that LM-4131 , LMX , and Celecoxib decreased mean feeding latency in older , 4-month-old mice , 8 hr after foot-shock stress , but not in non-stressed controls ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . Additionally , LM-4131 also reduced mean feeding latency 8-hr post-stress in female mice ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ) . Moreover , to examine whether the SSCI , LM-4131 , retained anxiolytic-like efficacy following a more chronic , severe stressor , male mice were exposed to foot-shock stress for 5 consecutive days . Under these conditions , LM-4131 administered 2 hr prior to testing was still able to reduce mean feeding latency in stressed mice , but not non-stressed controls ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3 ) . Finally , we tested for the effects of repeated daily treatment with LMX ( used instead of LM-4131 due to its long half-life ( Mangold et al . , 2004 ) for 5 consecutive days prior to acute stress exposure . This subchronic treatment regimen reduced feeding latency 8 hr after stress , with no effects in non-stressed controls , thereby mimicking the effects of acute treatment ( Figure 1—figure supplement 4 ) . There were no effects of this subchronic LMX treatment on body weight in either group ( Figure S4 ) . Also of note , neither acute LM-4131 nor LMX treatment affected overall locomotor activity in the open-field assay ( Figure 1—figure supplement 5 ) , indicating drug-induced reductions in feeding latency were not an artifact of hyperactivity . Taken together , these data demonstrate that COX-2 inhibition exerts a robust , preferential attenuation of stress-induced affective dysregulation across a range of experimental conditions . We also examined the effects of COX-2 inhibition in a well-established test for anxiety-like behavior , the elevated-plus maze ( EPM ) . In non-stressed mice , drug treatment increased open arm entries and closed arm latency , without affecting other measures ( Figure 2A ) . In mice stressed 8 hr earlier , treatment with either LM-4131 or LMX reduced the latency to enter an open arm and increased the latency to enter closed arm and to freeze , but did not alter open arm time or entries or total distance traveled ( Figure 2B ) . In a separate cohort of 4-month-old mice , LM-4131 and LMX reduced open-arm latency and latency to freeze regardless of prior stress exposure ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) . These data demonstrate the effects of COX-2 inhibition are evident across behavioral assays , and are not restricted to appetitive motivated behavioral tests such as the NIH assay . 10 . 7554/eLife . 14137 . 009Figure 2 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 14137 . 010 In addition to the anxiety-like phenotype caused by foot-shock stress exposure , re-exposure to the foot-shock context induces a conditioned fear response in the form of freezing . We therefore tested the effects of COX-2 inhibition on this conditioned fear response by administering LM-4131 , LMX or Celecoxib 6 hr after foot-shock and then testing for contextual freezing 2 hr later ( see Figure 3A for experimental design ) . Acquisition of freezing behavior during foot-shock was not different between treatment groups prior to drug administration ( Figure 3B ) . However , drug treatment reduced expression of contextual fear measured 8 hr post-conditioning ( Figure 3C ) . Freezing levels were low on a subsequent drug-free retrieval test 24 hr after conditioning , indicating extinction or decay of the conditioned-fear response , and no residual drug treatment effect was evident at this time point ( Figure 3D ) . These data extend our stress-induced anxiety-related findings by demonstrating attenuation in the expression of contextual conditioned fear by COX-2 inhibition . 10 . 7554/eLife . 14137 . 011Figure 3 .

Interestingly , we found that neither LM-4131 , LMX , nor Celecoxib altered TST immobility time in non-stressed mice ( Figure 4A ) and that LM-4131 also had no effect on this behavior in mice given foot-shock stress 8 or 24 hr previously ( Figure 4B–C ) . In a similar vein , LM-4131 had no effect on sucrose consumption or preference , either under non-stressed conditions or 8 hr following foot-shock ( Figure 5 ) . These data highlight a degree of specificity in the behavioral effects of acute COX-2 inhibition . 10 . 7554/eLife . 14137 . 013Figure 5 . Effects of COX-2 inhibition in the sucrose preference test .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 14137 . 013 As we have previously shown that LM-4131 exerts behavioral effects via type-1 cannabinoid receptor ( CB1R ) activation subsequent to anandamide elevation ( Hermanson et al . , 2013 ) , we tested whether the anxiolytic-like effects of LM-4131 after foot-shock stress exposure were mediated via CB1R signaling . Replicating data shown in Figure 1A , under non-stressed control conditions , LM-4131 produced a slight but significant reduction in feeding latency , and this effect was blocked by co-treatment with the CB1R antagonist Rimonabant ( 2 mg/kg ) ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1 ) . By contrast , LM-4131-induced decreases in feeding latency , that were seen 8 hr after stress , were not prevented by co-administering a low ( 2 mg/kg ) or higher ( 5 mg/kg ) dose of Rimonabant ( Figure 6A–B ) . These data show that while the anxiolytic-like effects of LM-4131 are CB1R dependent under non-stressed conditions , in line with previous work ( Hermanson et al . , 2013 ) ; however , following stress these effects become CB1R-insensitive and likely mediated by other mechanisms . 10 . 7554/eLife . 14137 . 014Figure 6 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 14137 . 016 Although CB1R activation may not mediate the anxiolytic-like effects of COX-2 inhibition in stressed mice , the eCB anandamide can activate several molecular targets in addition to CB1R , including CB2R , transient receptor potential cation channel , subfamily V , member 1 ( TRPV1 ) receptors , and SK channels ( Di Marzo and De Petrocellis , 2012; Ross , 2003; Wang et al . , 2011 ) . Moreover , LM-4131 exerts preferential effects on anandamide over 2-AG ( Hermanson et al . , 2013 ) . We therefore tested whether blocking these alternate anandamide targets affected the anxiolytic-like effects of LM-4131 after stress . Neither co-treatment with the CBR2 antagonist , SR144528 ( 3 mg/kg ) , nor the TRPV1 antagonist , Capsazepine ( 10 mg/kg ) , blocked LM-4131-induced reductions in feeding latency 8 hr after stress ( Figure 6C ) . However , co-administration of the SK channel inhibitor , Apamin ( 0 . 4 and 0 . 8 mg/kg ) , blocked the ability of LM-4131 , as well as LMX or Celecoxib , to reduce stress-induced anxiety-like behavior ( Figure 6D ) . To further substantiate a role for SK channels in the effects of LM-4131 after foot-shock stress , we tested whether direct activation of SK channels was sufficient to mimic the anxiolytic-like effects of LM-4131 . Consistent with earlier data , LM-4131 reduced feeding latency in mice stressed 8 hr earlier ( Figure 6E ) . The SK channel activator 1-EBIO also reduced feeding latency , and the combined administration of 1-EBIO and LM-4131 did not produce a further decrease in feeding latency relative to either drug alone ( Figure 6E ) . Apamin and 1-EBIO had minimal effect on locomotor activity when administered alone at doses used above ( Figure 6—figure supplement 2 ) , showing these drug effects on feeding latency were not artifacts of locomotor disturbances . We have previously shown that eCB signaling effects on food consumption and feeding latency in the assay are dissociable ( Gamble-George et al . , 2013 ) . Therefore , we extended our analyses to measure drug effects on total food consumption in the NIH assay to clarify whether COX-2 inhibition affects feeding via a CB1R-dependent or independent mechanism . We found that reductions in food consumption produced by testing in a novel cage ( relative to the home cage ) ( Figure 7A ) were partially reversed by LM-4131 in mice with prior foot-shock stress exposure , albeit not in all experiments ( Figure 7B–F ) . In addition , examination of feeding behavior in our CB1R antagonist studies indicated that , in contrast to the negative effects of CB1R blockade on feeding latency after stress exposure , the ability of LM-4131 and LMX to normalize stress-induced deficits in food consumption was completely blocked by either 2 or 5 mg/kg Rimonabant ( Figure 7G–H ) . Thus there appear to be dissociable contributions of CB1R to the stress-related consummatory and anxiolytic-like effects of COX-2 inhibition ( Gamble-George et al . , 2013 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 14137 . 017Figure 7 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 14137 . 017 In order to gain insight into the synaptic and cellular mechanisms by which LM-4131 could affect stress-induced anxiety , we utilized ex vivo whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiological approaches . Specifically , we determined the effects of LM-4131 on cellular and synaptic physiology in the BLA , given its key role in regulating anxiety and stress-response integration ( Janak and Tye , 2015; Pape and Pare , 2010 ) . In control , non-stressed mice , incubation of brain slices with LM-4131 ( 10 μM ) for 2 hr did not affect intrinsic excitability ( Figure 8A–B ) or current-membrane voltage relationship ( Figure 8C ) of BLA principal neurons , and did not affect resting membrane potential , input resistance , or action potential threshold ( Figure 8D ) . Conversely , in brain slices prepared 24 hr after foot-shock stress , LM-4131 incubation resulted in a significant decrease in intrinsic excitability of BLA neurons ( Figure 8E–F ) . This reduction was not associated with changes in the current-membrane voltage relationship ( Figure 8G ) , or the resting membrane potential , input resistance , or action potential threshold ( Figure 8H ) . These data suggest that one mechanism by which LM-4131 reduced stress-induced behavioral dysregulation is via reductions in the overall activity of BLA neurons via reductions in intrinsic excitability . Consistent with our behavioral data , that the ability of LM-4131 to reduced neuronal excitability after stress exposure was blocked by the SK channel blocker , Apamin , but not the CB1 antagonist SR141716 or the TRPV1 antagonist , Capsazepine ( Figure 8—figure supplement 1A–C ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 14137 . 018Figure 8 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 14137 . 020 Given our behavioral data had indicated a role for COX-2-mediated enhancement of anandamide signaling in the anxiolytic effects of LM-4131 , we tested whether directly increasing anandamide levels , via FAAH inhibition , mimicked the effects of LM-4131 on cellular excitability and glutamatergic transmission . Indeed , incubation of brain slices from both control and stressed mice with the FAAH inhibitor , PF-3845 ( 10 μM ) , resulted in a decrease in cellular excitability ( Figure 8—figure supplement 2 ) . These data suggest LM-4131 may reduce stress-induced anxiety-like behavior by dampening neuronal activity in the BLA and , moreover , that these cellular effects can be mimicked by anandamide augmentation via FAAH inhibition . Amygdala neuron activity has been linked to the expression of anxiety-like behaviors ( Janak and Tye , 2015; Rau et al . , 2015 ) . On this basis and given our ex vivo physiological data , we asked whether LM-4131-induced reductions in BLA neuronal excitability were evident in behaving mice by conducting in vivo single unit recordings . We employed the EPM for this experiment because preliminary work indicated robust behavioral profiles and drug effects under the chronic recording conditions . That is , during recordings , mice treated with LM-4131 and tested 8 hr after stress showed increased open arm time and entries and reduced open arm latency , as compared to vehicle treated controls , consistent with an anxiolytic-like effect in this test ( Figure 9A–B ) . It is interesting to note that under these recording conditions mice exhibited high levels of anxiety with open arm time ~10 s , and LM-4131 was able to increase open arm time and decrease latency to open arm entry . In contrast , in previous studies ( Figure 2 ) , LM-4131 only affected open arm latency . Given that open arm time in these studies was ~25–40 s , these data suggest that the open arm latency measure is more sensitive to LM-4131 treatment , but as anxiety levels increase , LM-4131 can affect more conventional measures of anxiety in the EPM including open arm time . 10 . 7554/eLife . 14137 . 021Figure 9 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 14137 . 022 While mice were exploring the EPM , we recorded 62 and 66 single units from vehicle and LM-4131-treated mice , respectively ( n=12 mice per group; recording sites depicted in Figure 9—figure supplement 1 ) . Firing rates of each unit were analyzed during exit from the safety of the closed arms , and were classified as being excitatory ( at least 1 of 10 100-ms time bins following closed arm exit had an average Z-score of >2 , relative to a 1 sec pre-exit ‘baseline’ ) , inhibitory ( converse of excitatory ) , or unaltered ( no significant increase or decrease ) . The proportion of units falling into each of these 3 categories was no different between vehicle and LM-4131 treated groups ( Figure 9C ) . However , the magnitude of the increase in excitatory unit activity on exiting the closed arm was significantly lower in LM-4131 treated mice than vehicle controls ( Figure 9D–E ) . Furthermore , the effect of the drug was specific to excitatory activity , with no change evident for units exhibiting inhibitory activity on closed arm exits ( Figure 9D ) . The finding that COX-2 inhibition blunted BLA unit excitation in vivo fits well with our ex vivo slice results and , taken together , suggest a neurophysiological correlate of the anxiolytic-like actions of LM-4131 . 3 Discussion Here we show that acute treatment with the novel SSCI , LM-4131 , as well as two traditional COX-2-selective inhibitors , LMX and Celecoxib , acutely reduces stress-induced behavioral dysregulation in two separate assays ( the NIH and EPM ) , and reduces expression of conditioned fear , without affecting locomotor activity , sucrose preference , or despair-like behaviors . These effects generalized to male mice of different ages , female mice , and were evident even after repeated stress exposure . Moreover , the behavioral effects of COX-2 inhibition were maintained after subchronic treatment indicating a lack of drug tolerance . Together , these results suggest that SSCIs and traditional COX-2 inhibitors could represent viable therapeutic approaches for stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders ( Muller , 2010 ) . The three COX-2 inhibitors used in the present study represent different chemical scaffolds: LM-4131 is a morpholinoamide of indomethacin , while LMX is an arylacetic acid , and Celecoxib is a diarylheterocycle . LM-4131 is also a weak antagonist of CB2R ( Gaetani et al . , 2003 ) ; however , CB2R activation ( Bahi et al . , 2014; Garcia-Gutierrez and Manzanares , 2011 ) , but not inhibition ( Gamble-George et al . , 2013 ) , has been shown to have anxiolytic-like effects , and we have previously shown that CB2R blockade does not affect anxiety-like behavior in the NIH assay ( Gamble-George et al . , 2013 ) . Indeed , we were unable to prevent the anxiolytic-like effects of LM-4131 with a CB2R antagonist . The similar anxiolytic-like profile of the two other chemically distinct COX-2 inhibitors , which have no known activity at cannabinoid receptors , also argues against a CB2R contribution to the anxiolytic effects of LM-4131 . In principle , COX-2 inhibition could produce anxiolytic and antidepressant actions via one or more mechanisms of action: 1 ) preventing PG synthesis , 2 ) increasing eCB levels , and 3 ) concomitantly reducing levels of prostamides and prostaglandin-glycerol esters ( COX-2 eCB oxygenation products ) . On the one hand , the prior observation that COX-2 inhibition is associated with reduced stress-induced PG levels , cytokine levels , and other markers of neuroinflammation supports the first mechanism ( Dhir et al . , 2006; Kumari et al . , 2007; Munhoz et al . , 2008 ) . On the other hand , the current results provide some support for the alternate mechanisms . For example , the SSCI , LM-4131 , does not affect production of pro-inflammatory PGs ( Hermanson et al . , 2013 ) , yet is as effective as traditional COX-2 inhibitors in reducing stress-induced anxiety-like behavior . In addition , SK channel blockade and to a lesser extent , CB1R antagonism , both of which are molecular targets of the eCB anandamide , block some behavioral effects of LM-4131 , LMX , and Celecoxib . Consistent with our data , systemic and intra-BLA SK channel activation has been shown to reduce stress-induced anxiety and expression of conditioned-fear ( Atchley et al . , 2012; Rau et al . , 2015 ) . Finally , it is also possible that reductions in prostamides or prostaglandin-glycerols contribute to the anxiolytic-like actions of traditional COX-2 inhibitors and especially SSCIs . However , very little is currently known regarding the physiological role of these metabolites in the regulation of stress responses or behavior in general . Future studies will thus be aimed at determining the differential contributions of these three potential mechanisms of action of COX-2 inhibitors to reduce stress-related pathology . At a cellular level , LM-4131 decreased amygdala neuron excitability in stressed , but not control , mice . This effect was mimicked by the FAAH inhibitor , PF-3843 , which causes robust increases in anandamide levels ( Lee et al . , 2015 ) . Taken together , these findings support the notion that LM-4131 affects amygdala cellular physiology indirectly via enhancing anandamide signaling . We also found the decrease in BLA neuron excitability induced by LM-4131 ex vivo was blocked by the SK channel antagonist Apamin , but not the CB1 or TRPV1 antagonists , mirroring our behavioral studies . It is unlikely that that the cellular effects of LM-4131 are mediated via decreases in PG signaling since our in vitro data indicate that LM-4131 is a very weak inhibitor of AA oxygenation by COX-2 ( Hermanson et al . , 2013 ) . However , it is remains possible that the neurophysiological effects of LM-4131 are mediated in part via inhibition of prostamide signaling; a hypothesis that will require further testing . We also investigated the in vivo neurophysiological correlates of LM-4131-induced anxiolytic-like effects . Consistent with our ex vivo electrophysiological results , in vivo single-unit recordings revealed that the anxiolytic effects of LM-4131 were associated with a significantly attenuated increase in BLA neuronal excitability that was evident when mice left a relatively safe location . Given the strong link between amygdala neuron activity and generation of anxiety and fear states ( Janak and Tye , 2015 ) , these data suggest that LM-4131 could reduce anxiety-like behavior by modulating encoding of negative valence by BLA neurons; though further studies will be required to substantiate this idea . Similarly , whether LM-4131 induced AEA augmentation , and subsequent SK channel activation , contributes to the reduction in BLA neuron activity in vivo remains to be determined . Several clinical trials and meta-analyses of trials have now confirmed the efficacy of COX-2 inhibition as an effective augmentation strategy to SSRIs in MDD ( Abdallah et al . , 2015; Akhondzadeh and Jafari , 2010; Akhondzadeh et al . , 2009; Faridhosseini et al . , 2014; Fond et al . , 2014; Muller et al . , 2006 ) . In addition , COX-2 mRNA is increased in the circulation of patients with MDD ( Galecki et al . , 2012 ) . These findings are generally consistent with the known role of COX-2 as an immediate-early gene up-regulated by neurons in response to various types of stress ( Kaufmann et al . , 1996; Kulmacz and Lands , 1984; Yamagata et al . , 1993 ) . On this basis , it has been proposed that stress exposure could increase susceptibility to depression via generation of inflammatory PGs generated by COX-2; a contention in line with the neuroimmune hypothesis of depression ( Felger and Miller , 2014; Haroon et al . , 2012; Miller et al . , 2009; Raison and Miller , 2013 ) and the aforementioned clinical efficacy of COX-2 inhibition in MDD . The current study extends this model by supporting additional mechanisms by which COX-2 could exert therapeutic effects; specifically , via eCB augmentation and possibly reductions in COX-2 eCB oxidative metabolites , which are known to have actions opposing eCBs in some systems ( Ligresti et al . , 2014; Sang et al . , 2006 ) . This alternate hypothesis is consistent with data suggesting eCB deficiencies could contribute to the pathogenesis of some anxiety disorders , including PTSD ( Hill and Patel , 2013; Jenniches et al . , 2015; Shonesy et al . , 2014 ) . Our preclinical data support robust effects of COX-2 inhibition in fear and anxiety-domain behaviors , but preliminary analysis of anhedonia and despair-like behavior were negative . Therefore , although anxiety symptoms are highly reported in patients with MDD ( Fava et al . , 2006; Fried et al . , 2015 ) , and anxiety disorders and MDD are highly co-morbid ( Kessler et al . , 2005 ) , our data suggest clinical trials of COX-2 inhibitors in anxiety and trauma- and stressor-related disorders may also be warranted , and that SSCIs could represent a potentially attractive class of novel therapeutics for mood and anxiety disorders . 4 Materials and methods Male or female ICR ( CD-1 ) mice between 5–7 weeks of age or ~4 months of age were used for all experiments ( Harlan , Indianapolis , IN , USA ) . All mice were housed on a 12:12 light-dark cycle ( lights on at 6:00 a . m . ) with food and water available ad libitum . All studies were carried out in accordance with the National Institute of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals , and approved by the Vanderbilt University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee ( #M10/227 ) and by the NIAAA Animal Care and Use Committee ( #LBGN-AH-41 ) . All behavioral testing was performed during the inactive light phase of the mouse circadian cycle ( between 6:00 am and 6:00 pm ) . The drugs used were the COX-2 inhibitors , LM-4131 ( 10 mg/kg ) , Lumiracoxib ( 1 mg/kg ) , and Celecoxib ( 10 mg/kg ) , the SK channel antagonist , Apamin ( 0 . 4 and 0 . 8 mg/kg ) , the SK channel agonist , 1-EBIO ( 5 mg/kg ) , the CB1R antagonist , Rimonabant ( 2 and 5 mg/kg ) , the CB2R antagonist , SR144528 ( 3 mg/kg ) , and the TRPV1 antagonist , Capsazepine ( 10 mg/kg ) . Rimonabant and SR144528 were gifts from the National Institute of Mental Health Drug Supply Program . LM-4131 was synthesized as previously described ( Hermanson et al . , 2013 ) . Lumiracoxib was obtained from Selleck Chemicals ( Houston , TX , USA ) . Celecoxib and Capsazepine were from Cayman Chemical ( Ann Arbor , MI , USA ) . Apamin and 1-EBIO were from Tocris ( Minneapolis , MN , USA ) . Drugs or vehicle were administered by intraperitoneal injection at a volume of 1 mL/kg in DMSO . Drug pretreatment times were two hours prior to behavioral testing . Mice were moved to the test room for 1 hr habituation and placed in a 30 . 5 x 24 . 1 x 21 . 0 cm ( 175–177 lux ) chamber , which was cleaned in between testing with a chlorine dioxide solution ( Vimoba ) . After a 30-second habituation period , there were 6 x 0 . 7 mA foot-shocks separated by a 30-second interval , with each shock preceded by a 30-s tone ( 80 dB , 3000 Hz ) . Mice were then returned to their home cages and a holding room until further behavioral testing . Detailed methods for all behavioral tests are provided in the Supplemental Materials and methods section . NIH testing was carried out exactly as described previously ( Bluett et al . , 2014; Gamble-George et al . , 2013 ) . Individually housed mice were habituated to a novel , palatable food ( Ensure Homemade Vanilla Shake ) in their home cages for 30 min per day for 3 days under red light conditions ( 40 lux ) . The day after the final habituation session , mice were presented with the shake in their home cages and the latency to begin feeding and the amount consumed was measured . Mice were then exposed to foot-shock stress as described above and tested in the novel cage at 4 , 8 , 24 , or 72 hr after stress exposure depending on the experiment . Novel cage testing was conducted in a new cage , without bedding , and with a white paper placed under the cage using bright ambient lighting conditions ( 295 lux ) . Latency to feed in the novel cage and the amount of Ensure® consumed are reported . Drugs were administered 2 hr prior to novel cage testing . Open-field locomotor activity was analyzed and performed as previously described ( Gamble-George et al . , 2013 ) . The apparatus was elevated 47 cm from the ground , and consisted of 2 open arms ( 30 × 5 cm; 90 lux ) and 2 closed arms ( 30 × 5 × 15 cm; 20 lux ) extending from a 5 × 5 cm central area ( San Diego Instruments , San Diego , CA , USA ) . The walls and floor were made from black ABS ( acrylonitrile butadiene styrene ) plastic . To begin the test , each mouse was placed in the center , facing an open arm . Time spent , latency to enter , and entries into the open and closed arms , latency to closed arm exit , latency to freeze , and total distance traveled were recorded using CinePlex Behavioral Research System ( Plexon Inc , Dallas , TX , USA ) for chronic in vivo BLA unit recordings , or , for all other experiments , Any Maze tracking software . The mouse was considered to be in an arm when all four paws were in the arm . The test was 5 min in duration , with the exception of the chronic in vivo BLA unit recording experiment , which was 10 min in length . Mice were conditioned using the stress exposure procedure described above . Six hours later , mice were administered either vehicle or LM-4131 ( 10 mg/kg ) . Two hours later and again 16 hr later , mice were returned to the conditioned chamber for a 10-minute test . The VideoFreeze system ( Med Associates ) was used to measure freezing: defined as no movement other than breathing and measured when mouse movement fell below a preset motion threshold of 18 . The TST was performed as previously described ( Gamble-George et al . , 2013 ) . Each mouse was given twenty-four hours to choose freely between a 2% sucrose solution and tap water in 50 mL clear plastic conical tubes . To prevent side preference bias , the position of the two tubes was switched at every measurement of the amount of fluid consumed ( e . g . , 2–4 hr ) . No previous water or food deprivation was applied before testing . The consumption of the 2% sucrose solution or water was measured by weighing the conical tubes containing the fluids . Percentage sucrose preference was calculated as the ratio of 2% sucrose consumed over total fluid consumption multiplied by 100 . Mice were anesthetized with 2% Isoflurane ( Baxter Healthcare , Deerfield , IL , USA ) and implanted with 2 × 8 electrode ( 35-µm ) tungsten micro-arrays ( Innovative Neurophysiology Inc , Durham , NC , USA ) bilaterally targeted at the BLA ( 3 . 1 mm lateral , 1 . 2–2 . 2 mm posterior , 4 . 5 mm ventral relative to bregma ) . Following surgery , mice were individually housed and allowed at least 1 week to recover prior to behavioral testing . Animals were exposed to stress as described above . Five hours after stress exposure , mice received a pre-drug baseline recording session in its home cage . Individual units were identified and recorded for 5 min using the Plexon Omniplex Neural Data Acquisition System . One hour later , mice were administered either LM-4131 ( 10 mg/kg ) or vehicle and , 2 hr later , received a 5-minute post-drug recording session in the home cage . Immediately following this test , mice were assessed on the EPM as described above . Neural data was sorted using the Plexon Offline Sorter and analyzed using NeuroExplorer 5 . 0 ( Nex Technologies , Madison , AL , USA ) . For analysis of unit recording data , waveforms were isolated manually using principal component analysis ( Offline Sorter , Plexon Inc ) . To be included in the analyses , spikes had to exhibit a refractory period of at least 1 millisecond . Autocorrelograms from simultaneously recorded units were examined to ensure that no cell was counted twice . Each unit’s activity was sorted into 100 millisecond bins , time-locked to exits from the safety of the closed arm and z-scored to average activity during a 1-s pre-exit baseline . Units were classified as either 1 ) excitatory , if 1 or more post-exit bins during 1-s post-exit exceeded 2 z-scores , 2 ) inhibitory , if 1 or more post-exit bins was less than 2 z-scores , or 3 ) non-responsive , if no post-exit bin was > or < 2 z-scores . Analysis of arm entry responsiveness included 67 cells in vehicle-treated animals , and 72 cells in LM-4131-treated animals . Data reported for raw firing rates included only putative principal neurons; any unit with a baseline firing rate over 7 Hz was excluded ( 5 vehicle and 3 LM-4131; see [Likhtik et al . , 2006] ) . Brain slice preparation and whole-cell patch clamp recordings were performed exactly as described previously ( Ramikie et al . , 2014; Shonesy et al . , 2014; Sumislawski et al . , 2011 ) . Statistical analysis of single unit data is above . For all other experiments , statistical significance was calculated by two-tailed unpaired t-test or Kolmogorov-Smirnov test ( only for frequency distribution plots ) , or one-way or two-way ANOVA with post hoc Holm-Sidak’s multiple comparisons test as noted in figure legends . All statistical analyses were conducted using Prism Graphpad 6 ( San Diego , CA , USA ) . No a priori power analysis was conducted; however , minimum sample sized were based on our published experience with behavioral and physiological assays used . All experiments were performed in 2 or more independent cohorts of animals except in vivo electrophysiological studies . For behavioral studies , all replicates ( n values ) represent biological replicates defined as data derived from a single mouse . Data are presented as mean ± S . E . M . unless otherwise stated in the figure legends . P<0 . 05 was considered significant throughout . Grubb’s test was used to remove outliers ."}

We generated ensembles of structures by time-averaged refinement , where local molecular vibrations were sampled by molecular-dynamics ( MD ) simulation whilst global disorder was partitioned into an underlying overall translation–libration–screw ( TLS ) model .

Order–disorder changes in HIV protease indicate a mechanism of entropy compensation for ordering the catalytic residues upon ligand binding by disordering specific core residues . Thus , ensemble refinement extracts dynamical details from the X-ray data that allow a more comprehensive understanding of structure–dynamics–function relationships .", "plain language summary": "It has been clear since the early days of structural biology in the late 1950s that proteins and other biomolecules are continually changing shape , and that these changes have an important influence on both the structure and function of the molecules . X-ray diffraction can provide detailed information about the structure of a protein , but only limited information about how its structure fluctuates over time . Detailed information about the dynamic behaviour of proteins is essential for a proper understanding of a variety of processes , including catalysis , ligand binding and protein–protein interactions , and could also prove useful in drug design . Currently most of the X-ray crystal structures in the Protein Data Bank are ‘snap-shots’ with limited or no information about protein dynamics . However , X-ray diffraction patterns are affected by the dynamics of the protein , and also by distortions of the crystal lattice , so three-dimensional ( 3D ) models of proteins ought to take these phenomena into account . Molecular-dynamics ( MD ) computer simulations transform 3D structures into 4D ‘molecular movies’ by predicting the movement of individual atoms . Combining MD simulations with crystallographic data has the potential to produce more realistic ensemble models of proteins in which the atomic fluctuations are represented by multiple structures within the ensemble . Moreover , in addition to improved structural information , this process—which is called ensemble refinement—can provide dynamical information about the protein . Earlier attempts to do this ran into problems because the number of model parameters needed was greater than the number of observed data points . Burnley et al . now overcome this problem by modelling local molecular vibrations with MD simulations and , at the same time , using a course-grain model to describe global disorder of longer length scales . Ensemble refinement of high-resolution X-ray diffraction datasets for 20 different proteins from the Protein Data Bank produced a better fit to the data than single structures for all 20 proteins . Ensemble refinement also revealed that 3 of the 20 proteins had a ‘molten core’ , rather than the well-ordered residues core found in most proteins: this is likely to be important in various biological functions including ligand binding , filament formation and enzymatic function . Burnley et al . also showed that a HIV enzyme underwent an order–disorder transition that is likely to influence how this enzyme works , and that similar transitions might influence the interactions between the small-molecule drug Imatinib ( also known as Gleevec ) and the enzymes it targets . Ensemble refinement could be applied to the majority of crystallography data currently being collected , or collected in the past , so further insights into the properties and interactions of a variety of proteins and other biomolecules can be expected .", "article": "1 Introduction Since the dawn of structural biology there have been experimental observations of dynamic motion in proteins and other biomolecules ( Linderstrøm-Lang and Schellman , 1959 ) . Multiple biophysical methods have firmly established that such atomic ‘wigglings and jigglings’ ( Feynman et al . , 1963 ) play an inherent role in both protein structure and function; and , in conjunction with high-resolution structures insights into dynamics aid the understanding of biomolecular functions in catalysis , ligand or drug binding and macromolecular interactions . Presently X-ray diffraction and NMR spectroscopy are the primary source of data for high-resolution protein structures . Whereas microscopy methods may provide information regarding long-range conformational changes , NMR characterizes fluctuations at atomic detail . However , due to the challenging nature of such experiments the number of dynamics studies is relatively sparse in contrast with the wealth of structural information available in the Protein Data Bank ( PDB ) ( Berman et al . , 2000 ) . The majority of entries in the PDB derived from X-ray diffraction data are presented as static , single , structures , although there is often extensive disorder resulting from protein dynamics and crystal-lattice distortions . Extracting atomic fluctuations from these diffraction data would dramatically increase the scope for dynamics studies of biomolecules and potentially reveal atomic details of structure–function–dynamic mechanisms that have previously been obscured . The diffraction data of proteins are affected by multiple sources of disorder , notably arising from atomic vibrations , concerted motions of protein domains and inter-molecular lattice distortions . Structural models of proteins should account for both anisotropic and anharmonic distributions around the mean atomic positions to reproduce the observed Bragg intensities accurately ( Vitkup et al . , 2002; Furnham et al . , 2006 ) . However , explicit modelling of such distributions in macromolecules using current methods requires extensive parameterization inappropriate for the diffraction quality of a typical protein crystal . Multi-conformer structures represent both anisotropic and anharmonic disorder , but despite numerous attempts at automating the inclusion of minor conformations ( DePristo et al . , 2004; Levin et al . , 2007; Terwilliger et al . , 2007; Korostelev et al . , 2009; van den Bedem et al . , 2009; Lang et al . , 2010 ) , 95% of all protein residues in the Protein Data Bank ( PDB ) ( Berman et al . , 2000 ) derived from diffraction data are modelled with a single conformation ( Lang et al . , 2010 ) . As opposed to multiple discrete models , a MD simulation with time-averaged restraints ( Gros et al . , 1990 ) results in a population of structures in which the individual models are interrelated by a Boltzmann-weighted energy function . This method introduced by Torda et al . ( 1989 ) and implemented in macromolecular crystallography by Gros et al . ( 1990 ) , showed a reduction in R-value . However , cross-validation introduced subsequently ( Brünger , 1992 ) revealed chronically over-fitted models ( Burling and Brunger , 1994; Clarage and Phillips , 1994; Schiffer et al . , 1995 ) . Here , we present an ensemble-refinement method that restricts the number of structures modelled and thereby prevents over-fitting of the data . We model large-scale motions , attributable to , for example , lattice distortions , by an underlying global disorder model . This approach allows MD simulations to sample local atomic fluctuations only , without the need for sampling large-scale global disorder . We show that the method yields reproducible ensembles with improved fit to the X-ray data , as validated by cross validation , Rfree ( Brünger , 1992 ) , and stereochemical analyses . Analyses of the ensembles show that detailed features are observed indicating atomic fluctuations that may be relevant for the biological function of the macromolecules . 2 Results and discussion We performed MD simulations , in which the model was restrained by a time-averaged X-ray ( Gros et al . , 1990 ) , maximum-likelihood ( Pannu and Read , 1996; Adams et al . , 1997; Murshudov et al . , 1997 ) target function ( see ‘Materials and methods’ ) . The X-ray restraint optimized 〈Fcalc ( hkl ) 〉 against Fobs ( hkl ) , where 〈Fcalc ( hkl ) 〉 are computed as rolling averages from the structures in the MD trajectory , with the length of the averaging window determined by the relaxation time τx . This approach contrasts with the traditional crystallographic refinement approach , where Fcalc ( hkl ) are computed from a single structure and optimized against Fobs ( hkl ) . Prior to the simulations we approximated the large-scale disorder by an overall TLS model derived from the atomic B-factors of the refined single structure . Using one TLS group per protein molecule or domain , we iteratively fitted TLS parameters ( Schomaker and Trueblood , 1968; Winn et al . , 2001 ) to the atomic B-factors of the protein atoms excluding atoms with large deviations in B-factor from the TLS-derived B-factor ( the parameter pTLS described the percentage of atoms included in TLS-fitting; see ‘Materials and methods’ ) . The resulting TLS model was applied to all atoms throughout the simulation . Effectively , this TLS model of the protein core excludes the effects of hyper-flexible surface loops and , hence , describes the global disorder that may be attributed to inter-molecular lattice distortions and overall intra-molecular breathing or domain shifts . Ensemble refinement was tested using 20 diffraction datasets from the PDB and started from either the PDB or PDB_REDO ( Joosten et al . , 2010 ) structures ( ‘Materials and methods’ ) . Upper resolution limits of the datasets ranged from 1 . 1 to 3 . 1 Å resolution and structures had 50 to 1 , 004 amino-acid residues in the asymmetric unit ( Table 1 ) . The simulations were run at an effective temperature of 300 K for the protein atoms , using a temperature bath ( Tbath ) slightly below 300 K to allow for heating due to the non-conservative nature of the time-averaged X-ray restraint modulated by its weight wx-ray ( ‘Materials and methods’ ) . Explicitly modelled solvent atoms were added and/or removed intermittently during the simulation dependent on the corresponding electron-density and difference maps ( ‘Materials and methods’ ) . Bulk solvent effects were accounted for by an averaged Flat Bulk-Solvent Model ( Jiang and Brünger , 1994; Afonine et al . , 2005 ) ( ‘Materials and methods’ ) . The parameters pTLS , τx and the Tbath and wx-ray pair were optimized in a grid search resulting in a shallow optimum scored by Rfree ( Figure 1A ) . After a period of equilibration , the trajectory of structures was acquired over an extensive period of time ( 40 times τx ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 00311 . 003Table 1 .

All molecular graphics figures are drawn using PyMol ( The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System , Schrödinger , LLC ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 00311 . 004 Figure 1B shows the R-values as they developed over the simulation time for a structure with PDB code 1UOY ( Olsen et al . , 2004 ) , for which the largest improvement in Rfree was observed among the datasets tested ( possibly due to the high degree of anisotropic and anharmonic side-chain motion for this case ) . The R-values started at a high value and remained high ( ∼35% ) for the individual structures , which is in agreement with the observation that the derived global TLS B-factor model is not optimal for fitting a single structure to the data . Averaging the structure factors over the relaxation time τx of 1 ps ( corresponding to the rolling average structure factors used in the X-ray restraint ) dropped the Rwork and Rfree to ∼11% and ∼15% respectively . The Rwork and Rfree of the collected ensemble of structures ( corresponding to unweighted averaged structure factors ) monotonically decreased to 10 . 3 and 13 . 7% respectively . over the acquisition period of 40 ps . The improvement in R-values from the ensemble model with respect to the single-structure model spanned the entire resolution range of the data ( Figure 1C ) . Acquisition over 40 times τx yielded a highly redundant set of structures . We reduced the number of structures by calculating the minimum number of structures , that is 167 in the case of 1UOY , required to reproduce the R-value of the trajectory ( Figure 1D and ‘Materials and methods’ ) . Analysis of all 20 datasets showed that ensemble refinement improved the Rfree by between 0 . 3 and 4 . 9 percentage points compared to single structures re-refined using the same program package , that is Phenix ( Afonine et al . , 2012 ) , with a mean improvement of 1 . 8% in Rfree values ( Table 1 , Figure 2A ) . The effect of the starting structure on ensemble refinement was assessed by using alternative refinement programs , phenix . refine , Refmac ( Vagin et al . , 2004 ) , and Buster ( Bricogne et al . , 2009 ) , to generate varying input models . No significant differences were observed due to the different starting models ( Tables 3 and 4 ) . The improvement in Rfree , number of structures in the final ensemble and the averaging time τx tended to increase with resolution ( Figure 2A–C ) . The optimum values for the parameters pTLS and Tbath are not correlated with resolution ( Figure 2D , E ) . Concomitant with the reduction in R-values , the ensemble models reduced electron-density differences , decreasing rms fluctuations in difference maps by 0 to 41% with an average of 12% improvement ( Table 2 ) . The difference electron-density maps for the single-structure and ensemble models indicated improvements throughout the asymmetric unit cell , as exemplified in Figure 1E . 10 . 7554/eLife . 00311 . 005Figure 2 .

The overall correlation coefficient between the electron-density map from the ensemble model ( obtained without experimental phases ) and the experimentally phased electron-density map was 0 . 903 , compared with 0 . 873 and 0 . 895 for the published and re-refined single structures . These seemingly small improvements in overall quality indicators allow for significant local improvements . Real-space correlation coefficients ( Brändén and Jones , 1990 ) highlighted marked local improvements for flexible residues in particular ( Figure 3A ) with 11 residues improving by more than 0 . 1 in correlation coefficient . This observation was consistent with local improvements in electron-density differences in regions of flexible or disordered side chains ( Figure 3B ) . Moreover , the ensemble model contained structural details previously identified in a multiple-model approach by Burling et al . ( 1996 ) , as shown for the anisotropic distribution for the side chain of Phe121 ( Figure 3C ) and diffuse water shells around hydrophobic residues ( Figure 3D ) . Figure 3E shows that the most occupied water sites in the ensemble correlated with low atomic B-factors for waters in the single-structure model . 10 . 7554/eLife . 00311 . 009Figure 3 . Validation of ensemble refinement using dataset 1YTT with exceptionally high quality experimental phases . ( A ) Real space cross-correlation of experimentally phased electron density map ( |Fobs|exp[iφobs] ) and model map ( |Fmodel|exp[iφmodel] ) for the single-structure ( black ) and ensemble model ( chain A and B , blue and red respectively ) shows improvements particularly for disordered areas ( atomic B-factors from the re-refined single structure are shown in grey dashed lines ) . ( B ) Example of improved vector-difference map ( |Fobs|exp[iφobs] − |Fmodel|exp[iφmodel] ) , contoured at 0 . 71 e/Å3 equivalent to 2 . 5 σ for the single structure for Gln167 , chain A , for single ( left-hand side ) and ensemble structure ( right-hand side ) . ( C ) Conformer distribution of Phe121 ( chain A ) with the experimental phased map ( |Fobs|exp[iφobs] ) contoured at 1 . 4 σ is highly similar to the multi-conformer shown in Figure 1c in Burling et al .

Ensemble structure with experimental phased experimental map ( |Fobs|exp[iφobs] ) contoured at 1 . 4 σ ( left side ) and 0 . 7 σ ( right side ) , as shown in Figure 2b in Burling et al . ( 1996 ) . ( E ) Scatter plot showing the anti-correlation between the B-factor of explicit solvent molecules in the re-refined single-structure and the relative occupancy of water molecules at that same position ( within 0 . 5-Å distance ) in the ensemble model . Due to the difficulty in differentiating between disorder ( B-factor ) and occupancy for explicitly modelled water atoms in single structures a high B-factor is likely to correspond to a partially occupied site . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 00311 . 009 Next , we analysed the stereochemistry of the computed ensemble models . The robustness of the observed atomic distributions was tested by repeating ensemble refinements 10 times using different random starting velocities . Figure 4A shows that the observed distributions are highly reproducible . With data extending to 1 . 5-Å resolution correlations above 0 . 99 were observed between residue distributions from separate runs . At lower resolutions , the majority of residues showed correlations above 0 . 95 , with occasionally correlations dropping below 0 . 8 in very flexible regions ( see Figure 4B , C ) . Clearly , the ensembles contain multiple values for each geometrical term that form a distribution , instead of a single stereochemical value obtained from a single structure; Figure 5A–D presents examples of side-chain distributions ( by χ1 and χ2 angles ) observed in the ensembles along with standard deviations computed from the 10 repeats . Averaged over all 20 cases , the rms deviations from idealized bond lengths , bond angles and dihedral angles for the re-refined single-structures were 0 . 010 Å , 1 . 26° and 15 . 2° respectively . ( Figure 6—source data 1 ) . These deviations decreased for the ensemble models by 0 . 002 Å , 0 . 26° and 6 . 6° respectively , when considering the centroids of the observed stereochemical distributions . Taking all fluctuations around the centroids ( i . e . complete distributions ) into account , these values increased by 0 . 002 Å , 0 . 33° and 4 . 0° respectively compared to the statistics from single structures . This indicates high stereochemical quality for the ensemble model , but that the ensemble of structures contained fluctuations exhibiting larger deviations from ideality . Figure 6A , B shows that high-energy conformations , as indicated by for example non-favourable Ramachandran φ , ψ-angle combinations , occurred transiently and were concentrated in regions of structural flexibility . Counting the most frequent Ramachandran classification for each φ , ψ-angle showed that the ensembles have a similar percentage for ‘allowed’ and an increased number of ‘outliers’ compared to the single structures ( Figure 6C and Figure 6—source data 2 ) . These analyses illustrate that in ensemble refinement conformations were sampled , rather than optimized to a single configuration as in single-structure refinement . Similar to Brünger ( Brünger , 1992 ) , we observe that lower Rfree values correlate with better quality of the Ramachandran statistics ( Figure 6D ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 00311 . 010Figure 4 .

In some cases , the applied global TLS models differed significantly between NCS-related copies ( Figure 7B ) . Nevertheless , we observed atomic fluctuations similar both in magnitude and location for related copies in areas not affected by crystal packing ( Figure 7B , C; additional cases of NCS are presented in Figure 7—figure supplement 1–4 ) . Apparently , variations in overall disorder arising from packing differences of NCS copies ( as indicated by different B-factor distributions ) were well accounted for by the applied global TLS models . Similarly , a global increase in disorder present in a dataset collected at ambient temperature vs an isomorphous dataset collected under cryo-conditions was fully accounted for by an increase in global TLS ( Figure 8A ) . These data indicate that the derived atomic fluctuations are molecular traits and that the global TLS model accounts for overall disorder , which includes for example lattice or packing effects . 10 . 7554/eLife . 00311 . 015Figure 7 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 00311 . 020 Inspection of the obtained ensembles showed that most proteins , as expected , are characterized by well-ordered residues in the protein core and flexible residue side chains and loops on the outside ( an example is given in Figure 9A ) . However , three cases exhibited marked flexibility of residue side chains on the inside of the molecule . 1BV1 ( Gajhede et al . , 1996 ) , major birch pollen allergen , has a large forked solvent channel with multiple disordered side chains and a diffuse water network ( Figure 9B ) . The cavity is consistent with its putative role as a general plant steroid carrier ( Marković-Housley et al . , 2003 ) . Presumably , the flexible internal residues play a role in binding the diverse ligands . More surprising are the disordered cores in 1X6P of PAK pilin ( Dunlop et al . , 2005 ) ( Figure 9C ) and 3K0N of the enzyme proline isomerase ( Fraser et al . , 2009 ) ( Figure 9D ) ; in both these cases , the datasets were recorded at ambient temperatures . Multiple ( 16 ) aliphatic and aromatic side chains are highly flexible , forming a molten core in the pilin molecule . These flexible residues , which are extremely well conserved in the type IV pilin family , create the central interface between the characteristic long α-helix and β-sheet of this protein fold ( Hazes et al . , 2000 ) . We hypothesize that this monomeric pilin structure represents an intermediate molten state , which becomes stabilized upon protomer filament formation . The third case with flexible residues on the interior is 3K0N of proline isomerase ( Fraser et al . , 2009 ) . As with the pilin structure , several ( 11 ) aromatic and aliphatic residues showed large side chain fluctuations , yielding a molten core of the protein structure . However , the same protein under cryogenic conditions ( 3K0M ) ( Fraser et al . , 2009 ) showed mostly well-ordered side chains in the ensemble ( Figure 9D , right-hand side ) , indicating that at cryogenic conditions the molten core has been annealed to its ground state configuration . As discussed in more detail in the next paragraph , the observed flexibility of the core residues at ambient temperature is likely of functional relevance for the enzyme . Thus , the computed ensemble models highlighted a hitherto unnoticed phenomenon of molten cores in folded proteins , which are likely relevant for the biological function of these molecules . 10 . 7554/eLife . 00311 . 021Figure 9 .

Bottom left insert shows secondary structure cartoon . Three datasets exhibit disordered interior sides chains forming a molten core region . ( A ) 3CA7 shows an ordered core with disordered hydrophilic side chains on the outside and is typical of the majority of the datasets . ( B ) 1BV1 , the major pollen allergen and putative plant steroid transporter , has a disordered central cavity ( location of cavity show with dotted lines ) . ( C ) 1X6P in the monomeric form of the fibril forming PAK pilin shows multiple disordered aliphatic and aromatic side chains in the interface between the N-terminal α-helix and the four stranded β-sheet domain . ( D ) Proline isomerase exhibits a molten core at 288 K , 3K0N ( left ) ; however , these interior dynamics are frozen-out at 100 K , 3K0M ( right ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 00311 . 021 NMR spectroscopy has previously revealed specific dynamics for active-site residues of proline isomerase ( Eisenmesser et al . , 2005 ) . The solvent-exposed residues Arg55 and Met61 in the active site showed disorder in 3K0M ( Fraser et al . , 2009 ) , where data were collected at 100 K . For 3K0N collected at 288 K , a number of additional residues with multiple conformations were observed ( Figure 8A , B ) . These included Ser99 , Phe113 , which are part of the substrate-binding pocket together with Arg55 and Met61 ( Figure 10A ) , and Leu98 , which neighbours the flexible residue Ser99 but points into the hydrophobic core ( Fraser et al . , 2009 ) . Ensemble refinement of the 288 K data revealed a large number of residue side chains in the core to be flexible . This flexibility in the core appears to be linked to the dynamics of active-site residues through the intervening β-sheet . In particular , the main-chain H-bonding network ( C=O·HN ) of neighbouring β-strands within the sheet was flexible , as indicated by anisotropy in the C=O bonds of residues 55-62-113-98 ( with the largest anisotropy observed for 55 and 62; see Figure 10B ) . Analysis of the side-chain conformations for the active-site residues Arg55 , Met61 , Ser99 and Phe113 showed a 10% minor conformation for the four active-site residues ( Figure 10C ) , which is in good agreement with NMR relaxation data ( see Figure 2 in Eisenmesser et al . , 2005 ) . Mutation of Ser99 to Thr ( >14 Å away from the catalytic Arg55 ) affects the side-chain distributions and lowers the activity ∼300-fold , similar to an Arg55Lys mutation of the catalytic residue ( Eisenmesser et al . , 2005; Fraser et al . , 2009 ) . Thus , the ensemble refinement results support the notion put forward by Eisenmesser et al . and Fraser et al . that side chain dynamics play a critical role in the enzymatic function of proline isomerase and , moreover , expand upon this theme to reveal mechanistic insights arising from the underlying detailed dynamics . 10 . 7554/eLife . 00311 . 022Figure 10 .

We compared HIV protease in its apo form , 2PC0 ( Heaslet et al . , 2007 ) , and bound to ligand JE-2147 , 1KZK ( Reiling et al . , 2002 ) . As for proline isomerase , HIV protease exhibited flexible , moldable , substrate-binding pockets in the apo state . Enthalpic and entropic binding of the ligand with high affinity ( KD = 41 pM ) ( Velazquez-Campoy et al . , 2001 ) reduced the flexibility in the substrate binding pockets by protein–ligand H-bond interactions and van der Waals stacking ( Figure 11A , B ) . Upon ligand binding , Asp90 became ordered through H-bonding with the ligand in P2 , whereas its dimeric partner lacked a H-bonding partner in P2′ and remained flexible as in the unbound state . The canonical aspartic protease catalytic residues , Asp25 of both monomers , became ordered upon ligand binding . Concomitantly , we observed significant changes in dynamics of specific core residues ( Figure 11C ) . Some residues , most notably Thr26 , ‘froze’ ( Thr26 is part of the conserved Asp25-Thr26-Gly-27 sequence ) . In contrast , the side chains of other residues , most notably Cys95 and Leu97 opposite of Thr26 , became highly disordered in the bound state , whereas they were relatively ordered in the unbound state . This observation supports NMR data that showed that conformational variability increases upon inhibitor binding for Leu97 amongst others ( Torchia and Ishima , 2003 ) . These data suggest that the entropy lost by the catalytic aspartates upon ligand binding is compensated with an increase in disorder of specific core residue side chains . This type of dynamic modulation was also observed for Ca2+ binding to calmodulin , where this effect was dubbed entropy compensation ( Lee et al . , 2000 ) . Similar to the molten core dynamics for proline isomerase , the structure ensembles generated by the ensemble refinement method revealed specific core dynamics for HIV protease , in particular a conformational exchange that is likely functionally relevant . 10 . 7554/eLife . 00311 . 023Figure 11 . Comparison of ensemble structures of bound and unbound forms of HIV protease . ( A ) Residues in the P1 binding sites are disordered in the unbound HIV protease ( 2PC0 ) , left-hand side , with carbon atoms shown in cyan , oxygen red and nitrogen blue . These residues become ordered in HIV protease in complex with a high affinity inhibitor , JE-2147 ( 1KZK ) , right-hand side with carbon atoms of the protease shown in green and of the inhibitor in purple . In 1KZK the two chains of the functional dimer are present in the asymmetric unit , whereas in 2PC0 a monomer is present in the asymmetric unit and the dimer is drawn using the crystallographic twofold axis . ( B ) Shows an alternative orientation showing the P2 binding site . ( C ) The catalytic Asp25 becomes ordered upon binding of the inhibitor , forming a hydrogen bond with the P1 carbonyl and hydroxyl of JE-2147 . In contrast , the distal residues Cys95 and Leu97 at the dimer interface become less ordered upon binding . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 00311 . 023 The development of new small molecule therapeutics is often supported by the use of macromolecular structure , typically X-ray crystallography of complexes between target proteins and drug candidates . These complexes are typically interpreted as static structures , and the impact of dynamics , if considered at all , is probed using computational methods . Our new ensemble refinement approach makes it possible to study the role of dynamics in drug–target complexes in the context of the experimental data . Therefore , we analysed two structures of Abl kinase in complex with Imatinib ( also known as Gleevec ) , that is 1IEP , and PD173955 , that is 1M52 ( Nagar et al . , 2002 ) . These compounds bind the Abl kinase with high affinity , 37 nM ( Schindler et al . , 2000 ) and 100 nM respectively ( Nagar et al . , 2002 ) . The ensembles provide insights into the flexibility of the protein residues and the ligand moieties in the complex . Figure 12A shows the variation in H-bonding observed in Abl kinase–Imatinib . Variable H-bonding interactions were observed for the hydrophilic N-methylpiperazine moiety with the backbone carbonyl atoms of Ile360 and His361 . In contrast , the ensemble displayed a well-ordered H-bond between the anilino-NH and Thr315 ‘gatekeeper’ side-chain . Moreover , the ordered water network between Glu286 , Lys271 and the pyrimidine moiety of Imatinib ( Nagar et al . , 2002 ) was reproduced in the ensemble model ( Figure 12B ) . We observed that the Abl kinase adopts two different states in these crystal structures . In the Imatinib complex the activation loop , residues 381–402 , is highly disordered ( Figure 12C ) , which was confirmed by comparison to previously published NMR data ( Vajpai et al . , 2008 ) . In general , the ensemble models indicate details of tight and highly ordered drug–target interactions on one side vs disordered interactions elsewhere , which are indicative of less tight interactions , that may suggest which sites to modify in a drug-optimization cycle . 10 . 7554/eLife . 00311 . 024Figure 12 .

Our ensemble refinement method samples distributions that reflect structural details of protein dynamics . The resulting ensemble models provide a more comprehensive description of the molecules and allow interpretation of the molecular function in terms of both the three-dimensional arrangements of the protein residues and their flexibilities . Moreover , ensemble models minimize the risk of structural over-interpretation associated with the seemingly rigid single-structure models . We found comparative analyses of protein molecules in different states to be very useful for identifying detailed changes in structural dynamics that may be mechanistically relevant for the molecular function . Partitioning large-scale disorder into a global model separates intermolecular variations of protein packing in the crystal from the detailed intra-molecular atomic fluctuations . Effectively , the X-ray gradient dictates the MD sampling to yield featureless , ( mFobs−DFmodel ) exp[iφmodel] , electron-density difference maps , while the global disorder model is accounted for by taking BTLS into account when computing the atomic densities . In this way , the ensemble of structures is generated to model the anisotropic and anharmonic electron-density distributions precisely , while being restrained by the bonded and non-bonded energy terms used in the MD simulation . The separation of global disorder and local atomic fluctuations contrasts the original approach by Gros et al . ( 1990 ) , where the MD sampling had to account for both the large scale global disorder and local fluctuations leading to very long relaxation times τx of 16 ps . In the current work much shorter relaxation times of 0 . 25–2 ps can be used , thereby limiting potential over-fitting markedly . The method is applicable to data with a wide range of upper resolution limits . We see marked improvements in Rfree for datasets ranging from 1 . 5 to 2 . 6-Å upper-resolution limit . A detailed interpretation of the ensembles is allowed , supported by the very high local correlations between independent ensemble refinements . However , at lower resolution limits and for highly disordered loops the local correlation between independent runs drops and detailed interpretation is not feasible . Thus , even though the number of independent parameters in an ensemble model is not clearly defined ( and therefore the parameter-to-observation ratio is unclear ) , the gain in Rfree and the very high local correlations between independent runs indicate a high reliability of the ensemble models . However , the method is not a panacea for highly disordered protein regions . In the absence of ordered conformations for a certain region of the protein ( as implicitly defined by the diffraction data ) the ensemble refinement will sample diverse conformations in order to prevent the build up of negative peaks in the electron-density difference map . In other words , if the data ‘says’ that a region is disordered , ensemble refinement will generate diverse conformations for that region . Furthermore , dataset pathologies caused , for example , by radiation damage may have confounded effects that obscure the dynamics inherent to the protein molecule . Thus , perhaps somewhat counter-intuitively , this modelling method that accounts for inherent protein dynamics does not help to resolve structural details of disordered regions , but is particularly suited to resolve dynamical fluctuations in ordered parts of the protein structure . Ensemble refinement of 20 protein datasets highlighted global dynamics features of protein molecules . Surprisingly , in some cases the ensembles indicated the existence of folded protein structures that display molten cores . Most likely , such molten cores may indicate intermediates of protein molecules that function in larger complexes ( such as PAK pilin ) , or alternatively these molten cores support dynamical fluctuations that are needed for ligand binding and enzyme functioning ( as for birch pollen allergen and proline isomerase respectively ) . Furthermore , the ensembles show details of specific order–disorder transitions , or conformational exchanges , between active site and core residues ( as for HIV protease in the unbound and bound state ) that suggest a mechanism of entropy compensation to support the enzymatic activity . The difference in dynamics observed between the ensembles of proline isomerase at cryo and ambient temperatures indicates that flash freezing of a crystal anneals local conformational fluctuations and thereby removes protein dynamics that may be functionally relevant . In conclusion , this new method of modelling X-ray diffraction data reveals a wealth of detailed information about the dynamics of biomolecules that complements the high-resolution structural information already available from the crystallographic experiment . In depth understanding of structure–dynamics in biomolecules will enhance our insights into the molecular mechanisms that underlie biological processes . 4 Materials and methods The single structure re-refinements used the same starting structure as the ensemble refinements ( alternative conformations were not removed ) and were re-refined using phenix . refine ( version 1 . 7 . 1 ) ( Afonine et al . , 2012 ) and Buster ( version 2 . 10 . 0 ) ( Bricogne et al . , 2009 ) . Standard parameters were used with the exception of optimizing the target weights and increasing the number of macro-cycles to 8 in phenix . refine . Explicit water refinement was performed , anisotropic ADPs were used if present in starting structure and TLS parameters were defined as used in the starting structure . PDB_REDO ( Joosten et al . , 2010 ) models were used as deposited ."}
