10.1371/journal.ppat.1002592	1: What is the most common cause of oral fungal infections?Answer: Candida albicans.2: How familiar are we with the pathogenicity mechanisms employed by Candida albicans during oral infection?Answer: Largely unknown.3: How many genes associated with oral candidiasis did this study aim to characterize?Answer: 12.4: What approach did the study use to characterize the 12 unknown function genes?Answer: Generation of homozygous knockout mutants.5: Did all 12 mutant genes cause significant epithelial damage?Answer: No, only 11 mutants caused significantly less epithelial damage.6: Which specific gene deletion resulted in the strongest reduction in pathogenicity?Answer: Deletion of orf19.6656 (DUR31).7: Besides oral epithelial damage, what other stages of candidiasis was DUR31 involved in?Answer: surviving attack by human neutrophils, endothelial damage, and virulence in vivo.8: What type of protein does DUR31 encode?Answer: A sodium/substrate symporter.9: Does DUR31 have a human homologue?Answer: No, it does not.10: What is one of the functions of Dur31 mentioned in the text?Answer: Transporting histatin 5, a highly cytotoxic antimicrobial peptide.
10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004696	1: What is the importance of terminal differentiation of B cells in the immune response?Answer: Terminal differentiation of B cells is essential for the humoral immune response in vertebrates.2: How is terminal differentiation of B cells achieved?Answer: Terminal differentiation of B cells is achieved through the concerted action of several transcription factors in response to antigen recognition and extracellular signals provided by T-helper cells.3: What is the current understanding of the regulatory network controlling terminal differentiation of B cells?Answer: There is no general consensus regarding the structure and dynamical properties of the underlying regulatory network controlling the process of B cell terminal differentiation.4: How was the regulatory network of B cell terminal differentiation modeled in this study?Answer: The researchers developed a dynamical model of the regulatory network based on experimental data available in the literature.5: What are the types of cells involved in the differentiation process according to the model?Answer: The model accounts for the differentiation of Naive, GC (Germinal Center), Mem (Memory), and PC (Plasma Cell) types of B cells.6: Can the models accurately describe the differentiation patterns of B cells?Answer: Yes, the models show consistency with the patterns of activation observed for Naive, GC, Mem, and PC cell types.7: What extracellular signals are necessary for B cell differentiation according to the models?Answer: The models describe the differentiation from the precursor Naive to any of the GC, Mem, or PC cell types in response to a specific set of extracellular signals.8: Which transcription factors are identified as key regulators of B cell differentiation in the model?Answer: The model highlights the importance of Pax5, Bcl6, Bach2, Irf4, and Blimp1 as key regulators of B cell differentiation process.9: How did the researchers validate their model?Answer: The researchers simulated all possible single loss- and gain-of-function mutants to confirm the importance of the identified key regulators in B cell differentiation.10: What aspects of B cell differentiation does the model qualitatively describe?Answer: The model qualitatively describes the directional nature of terminal B cell differentiation and key differentiation events from a precursor cell to terminally differentiated B cells.
