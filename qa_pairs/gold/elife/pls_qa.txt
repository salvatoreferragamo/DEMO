This protein plays a role in determining which sections of genetic information are recombined.6: What role does ZCWPW1 protein play in recombination and location selection during sexual reproduction?Answer: ZCWPW1 protein is involved in recombination and connects location selection by PRDM9 to the DNA repair mechanisms needed for gene exchange between chromosomes.7: How did researchers determine the binding sites of ZCWPW1 in human chromosomes?Answer: Researchers examined human cells grown in the laboratory to determine where ZCWPW1 binds to in the chromosome.
